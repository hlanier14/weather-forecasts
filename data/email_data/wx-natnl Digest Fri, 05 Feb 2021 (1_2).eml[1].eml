Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0918 AM CST Thu Feb 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

The ongoing elevated risk area has been refined based on recent
trends in the southward progression of the cold front and morning
hi-res ensemble guidance. The latest model solutions maintain
marginal wind and RH combinations (as outlined in the previous
discussion below), but areas of elevated fire weather conditions
remain possible ahead of the front later this afternoon.

..Moore.. 02/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CST Thu Feb 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
Most fire-weather concerns will be concentrated across areas of
southwest Texas and southeastern New Mexico ahead of a surface front
that should extend from the Texas South Plains into the Big Country
by noon.  Ahead of this front, northwesterly surface wind
trajectories will help maintain a dry airmass supportive of fire
weather - though dry, breezy conditions will also exist north of the
front across western Oklahoma and vicinity.  Farther southeast, A
dry airmass will reside across much of Florida, although surface
winds should remain rather light over land areas.  Offshore flow
will commence across portions of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties
through much of the forecast period, though fuels should remain
unsupportive of larger-scale fire weather given recent
precipitation.

...Southeast New Mexico and southwest Texas...
The elevated area in the prior outlook is maintained for this update
despite a trend toward lighter surface wind and slightly higher RH
values.  Nevertheless, areas of 15 mph surface winds will develop
amidst 15-25% RH values during peak heating hours.  Dry finer fuels
should support a risk of fire spread despite relatively low ERCs for
this time of year.

...Western Oklahoma...
Dry northerly flow will develop during the afternoon behind the
surface cold front.  As temperatures rise into the low 50s F, RH
values will fall to around 20% in tandem with 15-25 mph surface
winds.  Again, ERCs are relatively low for this time of year, though
locally elevated fire-weather conditions will exist where dry fuels
are present.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM CST Thu Feb 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Recent model runs
continue to show the potential for elevated fire weather conditions
on the lee side of the higher elevation of eastern and southeastern
New Mexico. Relative humidity values in the low 20s, along with
winds in the 15-20 mph range (occasionally gusting upwards of 30
mph) appear likely. However, these conditions will likely be
localized in nature and preclude adding a broader risk area.

..Moore.. 02/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1252 AM CST Thu Feb 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A weak surface pressure gradient will exist between a weak surface
trough centered over Nebraska and a high near the ArkLaTex D2/Friday
afternoon.  This regime will foster areas of westerly flow from
eastern New Mexico through much of Oklahoma and a small part of
western north Texas.  This flow will be strongest locally in eastern
New Mexico, although most speeds should remain around 15 mph or so.
The regime will also maintain a relatively dry airmass, with 20-30%
RH values across most of Oklahoma - slightly lower across areas of
west Texas.  The generally weak surface flow regime should allow for
only locally elevated fire-weather, though model trends will be
monitored for any stronger wind fields in later outlooks.

Elsewhere, locally elevated fire-weather conditions are expected
across portions of the TransPecos, where localized, terrain-related
surface wind enhancement will occur amidst a very dry low-level
airmass.  A dry airmass will also reside across coastal ranges of
southern California, though recent precipitation and light surface
winds should mitigate any fire-weather threat there.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak eventually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance continues to show a blocky pattern over Canada with
ridging in the north for most of the period and a deep upper low
farther south.  This mean upper low is most likely to be centered
between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay most days, possibly
consisting of multiple pieces of energy/individual centers.  In
response to this low, broad cyclonic flow will prevail across much
of the lower 48.  At the same time a mean ridge over the eastern
Pacific should let one or more shortwaves pass through, with these
features then progressing around the southern side of the CONUS
mean trough.  By late in the period forecast uncertainties include
how quickly the southern Canada low may begin to elongate and/or
progress eastward as the northern Canada ridge weakens, as well as
the strength of the eastern Pacific ridge relative to any
potential shortwaves.  Earlier in the period over the East the
guidance has been varying with important specifics of a wave just
off the East Coast on day 3 Sun as well as for another
wave/frontal system that may affect the eastern states a day or so
later.  The dominant highlight within this pattern remains the
much below normal temperatures expected over the central U.S. and
southward/eastward expansion of the cold air after early next
week.

The updated forecast used a composite of 00Z/06Z model guidance
and a small 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean component for the first half
of the period followed by a moderate increase of ensemble input
with the typical increase of detail uncertainties farther out in
time.  Already at the start of the period on Sun there is
significant spread/trending for the wave expected to track off the
East Coast.  Up through yesterday there had been a pronounced
trend toward a weaker/offshore system but overnight short-range
adjustments in the GFS/GEFS mean led to a stronger and westward
system.  Other new guidance generally supports the overall trend
but not necessarily to the extent of the GFS.  Based on this, the
manual forecast nudged the initial blend partially but not fully
in the GFS direction.  12Z ECMWF trend would support further
incorporation of the latest trends.  Behind this system, guidance
has followed through on signals that started showing more strongly
24 hours ago for frontal/wave development over the eastern U.S.
during the first half of the week.  A blended approach looks
reasonable in light of spread for depth and tendency thus far for
the strongest solutions to trend weaker in the next run.  This
evolution ultimately delays the eastward progression of the
central U.S. cold air by a day or two.

There is still some spread for leading diffuse shortwave energy
that may filter through the East Pacific mean ridge during the
first half of the week, though better clustering now exists among
the GFS/UKMET/00Z ECMWF which are all weaker than the 12Z CMC.
Toward Wed-Thu the ensemble means have trended stronger with the
East Pacific ridge over the past day or so.  This trend offers
support for leaning away from solutions that bring stronger energy
into the ridge, such as the CMC runs in particular and to some
degree 06Z/12Z GFS (which at least keep the energy farther north).



...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Anticipate terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and
vicinity, especially early in the period, as shortwave energy
streams across the region and the potent Arctic surge becomes
established.  Progression of the shortwave energy within the mean
trough may support some degree of wave development over the East
early next week, leading to a band of potentially meaningful snow
from the Midwest into the Northeast.  Precipitation would likely
be in the form of rain farther south.  Upstream shortwave energy
could generate one or more areas of lighter precipitation
thereafter, with the rain-snow line sinking southeastward as the
cold air expands.  Farther south a lingering lead front and a
secondary surge into the Southeast will pool moisture for
showers/thunderstorms through this period.  A Southeast coast wave
developing into Sunday and tracking northeastward has continued to
vary in the guidance, with latest stronger/westward trends leading
to increasing potential for precipitation (including some snow)
over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Areas to the west of
the Rockies should see fairly light and scattered precipitation,
but with uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for
supporting shortwave details.  Depending on the details of
evolution aloft, moisture may expand in coverage across the
southern tier states by late next week and interact with the cold
air in place to produce some areas of wintry weather in addition
to rainfall closer to the Gulf Coast.

Expect the most persistent core of coldest air over the central
U.S. to extend from the northern half of the Plains into the
Midwest and western Great Lakes.  Within this area temperatures
that are 15-30F below normal will be common through the period and
parts of Montana may even be 30-40F below normal from late weekend
into early next week.  A few isolated record cold highs may be
possible.  Cold temperatures will also spread robustly far south
and eventually to the east with time--delayed a bit from past
days' forecasts due to the front/wave now expected over the East
early in the week.  This expansion of the cold air should bring
temperatures down to 10-25F below normal from the southern Plains
into parts of the Ohio Valley by mid-late week.  Most areas over
the South and East should be near to somewhat above normal into
early next week.  To the west of the Rockies, initially expect
moderately above normal readings over the Great Basin/Southwest
and near normal temperatures farther north.  The West should see a
gradual cooling trend over the course of next week, leading to
below normal temperatures over the Northwest and moderation closer
to normal farther south.

SYNOPSIS: Arctic high pressure is forecast to shift south from Canada into =

central U.S. next week, likely delivering the coldest temperatures of the
winter to the Great Plains and Midwest. The major week-2 hazard remains muc=
h
below normal temperatures for much of the central and eastern U.S. Given th=
is
anomalous cold, there is an elevated risk of winter weather farther to the

are also favored for Mainland Alaska, but the cold is likely to be less
anomalous compared to the lower 48 States.



HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern and
Central Great Plains, Midwest, and Ohio Valley, Fri-Sat, Feb 12-13.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Fri-Mon, Feb 12-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for nearly all of the central

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 12 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 18: Model solutions continue to
remain consistent that Arctic high pressure (around 1056-hPa) extends from =
the
highest latitudes of western North America south into the Northern Great
Plains
and Midwest early in week-2. The anomalous cold across the central and east=
ern
U.S. is likely to peak in strength from February 10 to 14. A high risk of m=
uch
below normal temperatures (Feb 12-13) is posted where the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict that minimum temperatures have at least a 60 percen=
t
chance of falling below the 15th percentile of the climatological
distribution.
Based on these tools, there is around a 20 percent chance of near record lo=
w
temperatures across the north-central Great Plains and Middle to Upper
Mississippi Valley. Subzero minimum temperatures remain probable as far sou=
th
as northern parts of Kansas and Missouri. One change from the previous outl=
ook
is the expansion of  the moderate risk area to include more of Texas and th=
e
western Gulf Coast as todays reforecast tools have increased chances of mor=
e
than 40 percent that minimum temperatures fall into the lowest 15th
percentile.
Given the predicted pattern with surface high pressure nosing southward acr=
oss
the Great Plains, a frost could extend to the lower Rio Grande Valley. The
large spatial area with a slight risk of much below normal temperatures
through
the entirety of week-2 is necessary as uncertainty exists on how the longwa=
ve
pattern evolves by the end of the outlook period.



A strong cold front is forecast to push well south into the Gulf of Mexico
later next week with an increasing chance that a wave of low pressure devel=
ops
along the front by Feb 12. If a surface low develops, anomalously cold
temperatures would support snow to the northwest of its track. A negatively
tilted 500-hPa trough across the east-central U.S. along with subtropical
ridging over the southwestern Atlantic supports a continued risk of winter
weather across the Southeast and mid-Atlantic. The week-2 analog tools
(Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means) imply this outcome with elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation for these areas. Based on these
factors, a likely outbreak of Arctic Air, and 24-hour precipitation amounts=
 of
a 0.25 inch or more, liquid equivalent, from the ensemble means at varying
daily intervals, a slight risk of heavy snow (2 to 4 inches, or greater) is
posted for the Piedmont areas of the Southeast, Southern Appalachians, and
mid-Atlantic. If the strong block over the Davis Strait weakens, chances fo=
r a
winter storm at a higher latitude such as the Ohio Valley and Northeast wou=
ld
likely increase later in February.



The ensemble means depict a mean 7-day surface high to the north of Alaska
with
continued northeasterly surface flow, favoring below normal temperatures
across
much of Alaska during week-2. Based on the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools,=
 a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for northern Mainla=
nd
Alaska where there is near a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatures fall=
ing
below the 15th percentile and below -40 degrees F.

A cold front will continue to track from the entire Mississippi
Valley Thursday evening across the East Friday before moving
offshore by Saturday. Rain and snow associated with this system
will also spread east along and ahead of the advancing boundary.
Winter Storm Warnings, Blizzard Warnings and Winter Weather
Advisories are in effect from Iowa to the Great Lakes regions.
Periods of heavy snowfall along with gusty winds will be possible,
especially for portions of the northern Michigan and western Lower
Michigan. Rain is expected to move from the Lower Mississippi
Valley to the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to southern New England. The
trailing cold front will slow over the Gulf of Mexico before
stalling this weekend; which will keep rain showers possible
across parts of the Gulf states and the Southeast.

Out West, onshore flow over the Pacific Northwest will aid in
producing coastal rain and higher elevation snow over through
Saturday. Meanwhile, Arctic high pressure will slowly sag
southward into the northern-tier states bringing an abrupt change
to daily temperatures for a large portion of the country. Upslope
flow associated with the high pressure will aid in producing snow
over the Northern/Central Rockies and the Northern High
Plains/Northern Plains through Saturday.

troughing across the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS. Upstream of this trou=
gh,
ridging is forecast to expand across the Northeast Pacific. This favors
increasing heights along the West Coast of the CONUS and Alaska. The 6z GEF=
S
is
faster with this evolution compared to the 0z ECMWF and Canadian ensembles.
The
manual height blend depicts negative height anomalies for most of the CONUS
east of the Rockies. The only exception is across parts of the Southeast,
where
near to slightly above normal heights are forecast. The building ridge in t=
he
Northeast pacific favors above normal heights across Alaska and near to abo=
ve
normal heights over the western CONUS.

There remains high confidence for a major cold air outbreak across much of =
the
CONUS, beginning this weekend and persisting throughout the 6-10 day period=
,
as
the Arctic Oscillation (AO) is forecast to become strongly negative.
Temperature anomalies of negative 20-30 deg F are forecast across parts of =
the
Midwest, along with subzero temperatures likely across portions of the
Northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. Todays forecast depicts 80% or higher
probabilities of below normal temperatures over parts of the Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, with some probabilities
exceeding 90%, illustrating high confidence. Even outside of these areas th=
at
are forecast to have the most anomalous cold, probabilities of below normal
temperatures are elevated for most of the CONUS, consistent with the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF reforecast tools. The exceptions are over the Florida Peninsula where
above normal temperature probabilities are increased, as well as over the
Southwest where near to above normal temperatures are forecast. Both of the=
se
areas are favored to have relatively higher 500-hPa heights than the rest o=
f
the CONUS. Despite the positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast over Alas=
ka,
strong easterly flow favors increased below normal temperature probabilitie=
s
across the state.

Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased over most of the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast, in association with the aforementioned
trough axis, and surface high pressure favoring sinking air over these area=
s.
The greatest frontal convergence is favored to set up across the Southeast =
and
along the Gulf of Mexico coast where above normal precipitation probabiliti=
es
are increased. The mid-level ridging forecast to expand across the Northeas=
t
Pacific favors increased probabilities of below normal precipitation over
parts
of the western CONUS. A slight tilt toward above normal precipitation chanc=
es
is depicted across portions of the Rockies and High Plains, mainly due to
typically little precipitation at this time of year, combined with the
potential for intermittent disturbances to track along the periphery of the
expanding ridge axis to the west. This same ridge favors a generally quiet
pattern for Alaska, with probabilities of near to below normal precipitatio=
n
increased over the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
high confidence regarding below normal temperatures forecast across much of
the
CONUS and Alaska, offset by some uncertainty in the temperature forecast ov=
er
the western CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 12 - 18 2021

A continuation of the same synoptic pattern is forecast during week-2 acros=
s
North America. Troughing is favored over the eastern half of the CONUS, wit=
h
ridging becoming established over the East Pacific, and extending more into
the
western CONUS compared to the 6-10 day period. Todays manual 500-hPa height
blend for week-2 depicts below normal heights for most areas east of the
Rockies, and above normal heights to the west of the Rockies, as well as fo=
r
Alaska.

Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced probabilities of below
normal
temperatures for much of the CONUS, with the highest chances across parts o=
f
the east-central CONUS. The magnitude of the negative temperature anomalies=
 is
forecast to decrease, compared to the 6-10 day period, as the cold air mass
continues to moderate across the region, and the magnitude of the negative =
AO
decreases. However, it remains uncertain if the AO will remain negative or
switch back to a positive phase toward mid-February. A more negative AO fav=
ors
a continuation of colder weather across the CONUS. Above normal temperature=
s
are favored across the southwestern CONUS as a result of increased ridging =
and
positive height anomalies forecast across the region. Todays 0z ECMWF ensem=
ble
has trended warmer across the region compared to yesterday, now agreeing wi=
th
the 6z GEFS solution of above normal temperatures over the area. Easterly
surface flow is forecast to persist over Alaska, favoring increased below
normal temperature probabilities over most of the state.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly increased on th=
e
east side of the mean longwave trough axis over the CONUS, specifically ove=
r
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic, consist=
ent
with the uncalibrated model guidance along with the continued potential for
enhanced frontal activity across the region. Below normal precipitation
probabilities are increased over much of the southwestern CONUS due to
increased ridging. These elevated below normal precipitation chances also
extend through parts of the Central and Southern Plains, Middle Mississippi
Valley, and the Ohio Valley as a result of persistent surface high pressure
forecast over those areas. Enhanced above normal precipitation probabilitie=
s
are depicted across the Northern Rockies and Plains, consistent with the GE=
FS
and ECMWF reforecast tools and a continued potential for disturbances to tr=
ack
overtop the ridge axis to the west, as noted in the 6-10 day outlook
discussion. Below normal precipitation is likely for northwestern Alaska
underneath forecast above normal heights, with a slight tilt toward increas=
ed
above normal precipitation probabilities across the Aleutians and the Alask=
a
Peninsula due to increasing southerly mid-level flow as the ridge axis shif=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak eventually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance continues to show a blocky pattern over Canada with
ridging in the north for most of the period and a deep upper low
farther south.  This mean upper low is most likely to be centered
between the Great Lakes and Hudson Bay most days, possibly
consisting of multiple pieces of energy/individual centers.  In
response to this low, broad cyclonic flow will prevail across much
of the lower 48.  At the same time a mean ridge over the eastern
Pacific should let one or more shortwaves pass through, with these
features then progressing around the southern side of the CONUS
mean trough.  By late in the period forecast uncertainties include
how quickly the southern Canada low may begin to elongate and/or
progress eastward as the northern Canada ridge weakens, as well as
the strength of the eastern Pacific ridge relative to any
potential shortwaves.  Earlier in the period over the East the
guidance has been varying with important specifics of a wave just
off the East Coast on day 3 Sun as well as for another
wave/frontal system that may affect the eastern states a day or so
later.  The dominant highlight within this pattern remains the
much below normal temperatures expected over the central U.S. and
southward/eastward expansion of the cold air after early next
week.

The updated forecast used a composite of 00Z/06Z model guidance
and a small 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean component for the first half
of the period followed by a moderate increase of ensemble input
with the typical increase of detail uncertainties farther out in
time.  Already at the start of the period on Sun there is
significant spread/trending for the wave expected to track off the
East Coast.  Up through yesterday there had been a pronounced
trend toward a weaker/offshore system but overnight short-range
adjustments in the GFS/GEFS mean led to a stronger and westward
system.  Other new guidance generally supports the overall trend
but not necessarily to the extent of the GFS.  Based on this, the
manual forecast nudged the initial blend partially but not fully
in the GFS direction.  12Z ECMWF trend would support further
incorporation of the latest trends.  Behind this system, guidance
has followed through on signals that started showing more strongly
24 hours ago for frontal/wave development over the eastern U.S.
during the first half of the week.  A blended approach looks
reasonable in light of spread for depth and tendency thus far for
the strongest solutions to trend weaker in the next run.  This
evolution ultimately delays the eastward progression of the
central U.S. cold air by a day or two.

There is still some spread for leading diffuse shortwave energy
that may filter through the East Pacific mean ridge during the
first half of the week, though better clustering now exists among
the GFS/UKMET/00Z ECMWF which are all weaker than the 12Z CMC.
Toward Wed-Thu the ensemble means have trended stronger with the
East Pacific ridge over the past day or so.  This trend offers
support for leaning away from solutions that bring stronger energy
into the ridge, such as the CMC runs in particular and to some
degree 06Z/12Z GFS (which at least keep the energy farther north).



...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Anticipate terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and
vicinity, especially early in the period, as shortwave energy
streams across the region and the potent Arctic surge becomes
established.  Progression of the shortwave energy within the mean
trough may support some degree of wave development over the East
early next week, leading to a band of potentially meaningful snow
from the Midwest into the Northeast.  Precipitation would likely
be in the form of rain farther south.  Upstream shortwave energy
could generate one or more areas of lighter precipitation
thereafter, with the rain-snow line sinking southeastward as the
cold air expands.  Farther south a lingering lead front and a
secondary surge into the Southeast will pool moisture for
showers/thunderstorms through this period.  A Southeast coast wave
developing into Sunday and tracking northeastward has continued to
vary in the guidance, with latest stronger/westward trends leading
to increasing potential for precipitation (including some snow)
over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Areas to the west of
the Rockies should see fairly light and scattered precipitation,
but with uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for
supporting shortwave details.  Depending on the details of
evolution aloft, moisture may expand in coverage across the
southern tier states by late next week and interact with the cold
air in place to produce some areas of wintry weather in addition
to rainfall closer to the Gulf Coast.

Expect the most persistent core of coldest air over the central
U.S. to extend from the northern half of the Plains into the
Midwest and western Great Lakes.  Within this area temperatures
that are 15-30F below normal will be common through the period and
parts of Montana may even be 30-40F below normal from late weekend
into early next week.  A few isolated record cold highs may be
possible.  Cold temperatures will also spread robustly far south
and eventually to the east with time--delayed a bit from past
days' forecasts due to the front/wave now expected over the East
early in the week.  This expansion of the cold air should bring
temperatures down to 10-25F below normal from the southern Plains
into parts of the Ohio Valley by mid-late week.  Most areas over
the South and East should be near to somewhat above normal into
early next week.  To the west of the Rockies, initially expect
moderately above normal readings over the Great Basin/Southwest
and near normal temperatures farther north.  The West should see a
gradual cooling trend over the course of next week, leading to
below normal temperatures over the Northwest and moderation closer
to normal farther south.

developing into Sunday and tracking northeastward has continued to
vary in the guidance, with latest stronger/westward trends leading
to increasing potential for precipitation (including some snow)
over parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.  Areas to the west of
the Rockies should see fairly light and scattered precipitation,
but with uncertainty in specifics due to low confidence for
supporting shortwave details.  Depending on the details of
evolution aloft, moisture may expand in coverage across the
southern tier states by late next week and interact with the cold
air in place to produce some areas of wintry weather in addition
to rainfall closer to the Gulf Coast.

Expect the most persistent core of coldest air over the central
U.S. to extend from the northern half of the Plains into the
Midwest and western Great Lakes.  Within this area temperatures
that are 15-30F below normal will be common through the period and
parts of Montana may even be 30-40F below normal from late weekend
into early next week.  A few isolated record cold highs may be
possible.  Cold temperatures will also spread robustly far south
and eventually to the east with time--delayed a bit from past
days' forecasts due to the front/wave now expected over the East
early in the week.  This expansion of the cold air should bring
temperatures down to 10-25F below normal from the southern Plains
into parts of the Ohio Valley by mid-late week.  Most areas over
the South and East should be near to somewhat above normal into
early next week.  To the west of the Rockies, initially expect
moderately above normal readings over the Great Basin/Southwest
and near normal temperatures farther north.  The West should see a
gradual cooling trend over the course of next week, leading to
below normal temperatures over the Northwest and moderation closer
to normal farther south.

...Northern Plains to Midwest Arctic outbreak gradually expanding
to the south and east...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance continues to indicate a negative NAO/AO synoptic
pattern that supports a significant outbreak of arctic air from
central Canada into the Great Plains during the medium range
period.  A blocky and retrograding pattern over eastern and
northern Canada will keep the northern U.S. open for additional
cold air intrusion.  Meanwhile, a wavy slow-moving front near the
Gulf Coast will keep the arctic air from spreading too far into
the Deep South.  There is a general model signal for a swath of
wintry precipitation to spread across the Midwest to the Northeast
from Monday to Tuesday as a wave of low pressure develops along
the arctic front.  Differences in the timing and intensity of this
wave remain significant among global models, with the ECMWF
offering the slowest and strongest solution across the Northeast.
By the middle of next week, there is general model consensus for
the returning moisture from the Gulf to expand north and east
across the Deep South and eventually into the East Coast later in
the week.  The northern portion of the precipitation shield should
be in the form of rain and/or ice from the interior Deep South to
eventually parts of the Northeast.  Elsewhere, the highlight
within this pattern will be the much below normal temperatures
expected to remain across the northern and central U.S., which
will gradually expand  further to the south and east during the
latter part of next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were used for Days 5 and 7 given the increasing
model uncertainties.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Terrain/upslope snow over the northern Rockies and vicinity should
begin to slowly taper off on Monday as the main shortwave energy
slides eastward to support frontal wave development over the
Northeast mostly on Tuesday.  This should lead to a band of
potentially meaningful snow from the Midwest into the Northeast
from Monday into Tuesday.  Meanwhile, a stationary front across
southern Florida will lift northward and likely provide a period
of enhanced rainfall for the eastern Gulf Coast region into the
southeastern U.S. coast.  By later next week, there is an
increasing chance for Gulf moisture to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states in an overrunning pattern
north of a stationary front across the northern Gulf.  With the
cold air in place farther inland, a swath of wintry weather is
possible from the interior Deep South to the Northeast later next
week.

Expect the most persistent core of coldest air over the central
U.S. to extend from the northern half of the Plains into the
Midwest and western Great Lakes.  Within this area temperatures
that are 15-30F below normal will be common through the period and
parts of Montana even be as cold as -40F below normal early next
week.  A few isolated record cold highs may be possible.  Cold
temperatures will also spread farther south and eventually to the
east with time.  This expansion of the cold air should bring
temperatures down to 10-25F below normal from the southern Plains
into parts of the Ohio Valley by mid-late week.  Most areas over
the South and East should be near to somewhat above normal into
early next week prior to the arrival of the cold air.  To the west
of the Rockies, initially expect moderately above normal readings
over the Great Basin/Southwest and near normal temperatures
farther north.  The West should see a gradual cooling trend over
the course of next week, leading to below normal temperatures over
the Northwest and moderation closer to normal farther south.

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An expansive upper-level trough will remain anchored over the
central U.S., with a broad region of enhanced northwesterly
mid-level flow overspreading much of the western CONUS, extending
into parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains. Diurnal
heating and vertical mixing will result in sustained winds
approaching 15-20 mph along and east of the Sacramento/Guadalupe
Ranges in south-central New Mexico during the afternoon, while RH
values fall to near 20%. This combination of parameters should yield
at least locally elevated fire-weather conditions for perhaps a few
hours, however, such conditions appear too localized/transient amid
marginally receptive fuels to warrant the inclusion of an elevated
area at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0106 AM CST Fri Feb 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The broad upper-level trough will remain quasi-stationary over the
CONUS. Meanwhile, an embedded mid-level short-wave trough will
quickly traverse portions of the southern High Plains during the
forecast period, with an attendant region of enhanced mid-level
flow. At the surface, a cold front will sweep across much of the
Southern Plains. Post-frontal winds of 15-20 mph, gusting to 25-30
mph, appear possible, with RH values falling to near 20% during the
afternoon. There exists a fair amount of disagreement among the
mid-range guidance on the evolution in the aforementioned short-wave
trough. Consequently, uncertainty exists in the placement of surface
features that would yield an elevated fire-weather designation.
Therefore, while elevated fire-weather conditions seem quite
possible, despite marginally receptive fuels over the region, no
highlights have been introduced at this time.

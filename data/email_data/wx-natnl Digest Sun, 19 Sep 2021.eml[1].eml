Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1115 AM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE GREAT BASIN AND NORTHERN
ROCKIES...

Today's fire weather forecast remains on track, with only minor
modifications needed based on the latest weather and fuel guidance.
The primary adjustment with this forecast update was to extend the
northern Rockies Elevated fire weather area farther east into
portions of west-central South Dakota, western Nebraska, and north
eastern Colorado, where minimum RH values less than 10% (near 5%
locally), sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph, and receptive fuels
are expected. While some of these areas may see a bit lighter wind
speeds (e.g., across portions of Northeast Colorado where sustained
winds of 10-15 mph are more likely) ERC values exceeding the 90th
percentile across the area coupled with the extremely low minimum RH
values should foster Elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely today as
winds increase in response to an approaching upper-level trough in
the Pacific Northwest. Hot, dry, and windy conditions across much of
the West yesterday aided in curing fuels, which will help support
widespread fire weather concerns today. While this system will bring
beneficial rainfall to parts of the Pacific Northwest, thunderstorm
chances across Utah, western Colorado, and southwest Wyoming may
pose a low-end lightning-driven fire weather concern.

...Western Great Basin into Southwest Montana...
VWP observations over the past few hours from ID and MT show
strengthening mid-level flow as the upper-level wave continues to
move onshore across the Pacific Northwest. This trend is expected to
continue through the day as an axis of stronger flow becomes
established from northwest NV into ID and western MT ahead of a cold
front. Diurnal boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-directional
wind profile will allow for efficient downward transfer of stronger
winds aloft. Ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities
for 20-25 mph winds through this corridor with gusts up to 30-40 mph
(and possibly up to 40-50 mph for wind-prone locations). Receptive
fuels are already in place for most locations and RH reductions into
the low teens are expected. Critical conditions remain most likely
through this northwestern NV-southwest MT corridor, but may extend
as far south as the lee of the central/southern Sierra. There is
some uncertainty regarding the westward extent of both critical and
elevated conditions due to cloud cover/rainfall associated with the
approaching cold front.

...Southern Montana to northeast Wyoming...
Southwesterly winds will likely increase to 15-25 mph this afternoon
as a surface low deepens over the Canadian Prairies. Downslope
affects will aid in RH reductions into the low teens to low 20s, and
boundary-layer mixing will support wind gusts upwards of 25-35 mph.
Critical conditions are expected across south-central MT into
northeast WY where downslope warming/drying will be strongest in the
lee of the terrain, but may occur as far north as northeast MT.

...Utah, Western Colorado, and southwest Wyoming...
Thunderstorms are likely today across much of UT and into adjacent
areas of western CO and southwest WY as a surge of monsoonal
moisture shifts northward in tandem with a weak upper-level impulse.
Recent fuel analyses indicate some locations have receptive fuels
with ERC values above the 75th percentile and fine fuel moisture
values below 5%. As such, lightning may pose a low-end fire weather
concern. However, no highlights will be introduced given the overall
modest fuel status of the region and high wetting rain potential.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 PM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

Tomorrow's fire weather forecast remains mostly on track with only
minor adjustments made with this update based on the latest weather
and fuel guidance. One exception may be across portions of northern
California, where increasing northerly winds late Day 2/Sunday
evening into Day 3/Monday morning may allow for at least locally
elevated fire weather conditions considering somewhat poor overnight
RH recoveries. Though, at this time forecast RH values are a bit too
large to introduce an Elevated fire weather area. Furthermore, there
is potential for precipitation today into tonight (with
greater/lesser amounts north/south), which adds some uncertainty
regarding fuel status across parts of the area.

...Eastern Wyoming into the High Plains...
A minor expansion was made to the Elevated fire weather area based
on the latest ensemble high-resolution forecast guidance. While
locally elevated fire weather conditions appear likely farther south
into portions of eastern Colorado, at this time the forecast
spotty/brief nature of these conditions preclude an Elevated fire
weather area. A strong cold front is forecast to move across the
Elevated area during the late afternoon and early evening. Winds are
forecast to quickly shift from west/southwesterly to
north/northwesterly and become quite gusty, which would complicate
any ongoing fire suppression efforts.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will become limited spatially Sunday as
showers and thunderstorms overspread the inter-mountain West behind
a cold front. A trailing surface trough along the High Plains will
induce downslope flow across eastern WY and CO, which may result in
elevated fire weather conditions. Likewise, increasing winds ahead
of a cold front may support areas of elevated conditions across
southeastern Nevada. Fire weather concerns may also evolve across
parts of the southern Sierra, but will likely remain too localized
for highlights.

...Eastern Wyoming and High Plains...
Downslope west to southwesterly winds will likely increase to 15-20
mph across eastern WY Sunday afternoon, and a few locations may see
sustained winds near 25 mph prior to a cold frontal passage late in
the afternoon. RH reductions into the teens are possible, but may be
hindered by increasing clouds through the day. Elevated conditions
appear most likely across east-central WY, but may evolve as far
south as eastern CO.

...Southeast Nevada...
A cold front is forecast to gradually translate southeastward across
the Great Basin through the day Sunday. Ahead of this boundary, warm
temperatures and mostly clear skies will support deep boundary-layer
mixing that will likely result in RH reductions into the teens with
breezy 15-20 mph winds. Elevated conditions are possible, but the
spatial extent of the threat remains somewhat uncertain, especially
given the potential for wetting rainfall across far eastern NV and
western UT over the next 24 hours.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat from the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley through
the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences and Weather/Threats
Highlights...

Medium range model forecast spread has decreased Tue into Wed, but
uncertainty grows through later next week. The WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a blend of the 00 UTC
ECMWF with the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and the 13 UTC National Blend of
Models. The last few ECMWF ensemble runs were not available at WPC
due to computer issues. There has been a significant recent trend
in most guidance toward more robust flow amplification through
medium range time scales and this WPC blend adjusts product
continuity in that direction. The 12 UTC GFS has bucked this
trend, offering limited outlier uncertainty, but the rest of newer
12 UTC guidance remains in line to bolster forecast confidence.

In this scenario, potent system energy set to dig through the
Midwest may prove to be a gradually progressive heavy rainfall
producer and local runoff threat from the Great Lakes/OH Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic Northeast Tue-Thu, perhaps lingering into Fri
over the New Eng depending on uncertain upper system ejection by
approaching upstream northern stream energies. The threat is
expected to be fueled by pooling moisture/instability as guidance
now develops a supporting closed upper low and slows progression.
The system will be accompanied by a strong and focusing cold front
that will progress across the central and eastern states that
would also provide some focus for more modest rainfall down across
the South/Southeast. The lead large surface high and upper ridge
that will be across the eastern U.S. early in the week will
eventually give way to the approaching trough and front, which
will herald a pattern change compared to the recent extension of
summer-like heat and humidity. Steady and amplified upstream upper
trough progression through western Canada now noted in guidance
Wed/Thu would also be primed as a kicker to dig into the
north-central U.S./Midwest later next week along with another
associated frontal system, but with much less precipitation
potential with depleted moisture availability in the wake of the
main lead system. Best potential may over vicinity of the Great
Lakes under the meat of the trough. Meanwhile, weaker eastern
Pacific upper trough energy set to reach the Northwest midweek is
trending to now dig down the West Coast and eastern Pacific to
offer minimal additional precipitation potential for the region.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat September 18 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest/Northern California and the Tennessee
Valley/Southeast through Sunday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Upper Midwest, while temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees
below average over parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern
Rockies...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts Northern
Rockies/Northern High Plains into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region/Great Basin through Sunday morning...

An upper-level low over the Lower Mississippi Valley and tropical
moisture over the Tennessee Valley/Southeast will produce showers
and thunderstorms over the region through Monday. Some of the
Thunderstorms will produce heavy rain.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Tennessee
Valley/Southeast through Sunday morning.  The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.  The
excessive rainfall threat will continue over parts of the
Tennessee Valley on Sunday into Monday morning.

Meanwhile, moisture flowing into the Pacific Northwest will slowly
weaken overnight Saturday. The moisture will produce rain over
parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern California into parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region, ending overnight Sunday.  The
rain may be heavy at times.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Pacific
Northwest/Northern California through Sunday morning.  The threat
of excessive rainfall will be over by Sunday morning. However, the
system associated with the rain will move eastward into the
Northern Plains by Monday, producing rain and in a few of the
highest elevated areas, wet snow. As the system moves out of the
Mountains onto the plains, Showers and thunderstorms will develop
over parts of the Upper Midwest on Monday.

Furthermore, dry conditions and gusty winds with the system led to
a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of Northern
Rockies/Northern High Plains into parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region/Great Basin through Sunday morning.
Therefore, Red Flag Warnings are out for parts of northern Nevada,
southeastern Oregon, southern Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, and parts
of the Northern Plains. Additionally, temperatures will be 10 to
25 degrees above average over parts of the Upper Midwest, while
temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over parts of
the Pacific Northwest/Northern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 AM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning observations show a cold front gradually shifting
east/southeastward across the Pacific Northwest into the
inter-mountain West. This front, along with attendant clouds and
showers, will continue to overspread much of the West, minimizing
fire weather concerns in the process. Regional fire weather concerns
are probable across the central High Plains and southern Great
Basin, and more localized concerns are possible across parts of
California. However, the potential for widespread or robust fire
weather threats appears low.

...Eastern Wyoming...
A belt of stronger flow associated with the leading edge of an
upper-level trough will be positioned over the northern Rockies by
late afternoon. A combination of lee troughing and downslope
warming/drying will likely support areas of dry and breezy
conditions. Winds between 15-25 mph are likely with RH reductions
near 20% probable - though confidence in the coverage of ~20% RH is
somewhat low. However, fuels remain dry across the High Plains after
recent days of dry, windy weather, which should support at least a
low-end fire weather concern. Elevated conditions may evolve as far
south as eastern CO, but confidence in the wind/RH forecast is lower
for this region.

...Southern Great Basin...
Warm conditions and deep boundary-layer mixing are anticipated ahead
of the approaching cold front across southern NV into parts of
west/southwest UT. Relative humidity values in the teens to low 20s
are likely amid winds approaching 20 mph. Modest flow aloft will
limit the potential for stronger winds, and the passage of the front
may limit the duration of elevated conditions.

...California...
Localized elevated conditions are possible through California's
Central Valley this afternoon as northerly winds increase to 10-15
mph. Slightly above average dewpoint values are noted in upstream
observations across northern CA, which casts some uncertainty into
the coverage of sufficiently low RH. A few locations may see RH
reductions into the 20-30% range where stronger boundary-layer
mixing can occur. Elevated conditions appear more likely across the
southern Sierra where breezy downslope winds and 10-20% RH are
expected. However, these conditions will likely remain too localized
to warrant a broader risk area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 AM CDT Sun Sep 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
A cold air intrusion into the western US and Great Plains will
continue to mitigate most fire weather concerns for Monday, though a
couple regional threats are possible across the Four Corners region
and northern California.

...New Mexico...
Although zonal mid/upper-level flow will remain in place over the CO
Rockies, a southward surging cold front along the High Plains will
likely result in modest lee pressure falls on Monday. However, this
may be sufficient to drive 15-20 mph pressure gradient winds across
northern NM and southern CO. Coincident RH reductions into the
15-25% range and unseasonably dry fuels may result in areas of
elevated fire weather concerns, though the coverage of these
conditions remains uncertain due to high spread in guidance.

...Northern California...
Building high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will augment
northerly winds through the northern Sacramento Valley Monday
afternoon. Dry air advecting into the region, coupled with downslope
affects, should yield RH values in the low teens to low 20s. With
dry fuels already in place (ERC values near the 90th percentile),
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible within the Valley.

...Heavy Rainfall Threat from the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley to the
Northeast states...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The longwave trough that will be crossing the central U.S. is
forecast to evolve into a closed upper low over the Ohio Valley
and Great Lakes region by Thursday, slowly lifting to the
northeast by the end of the week as the cold front exits the East
Coast.  Another trough and surface cold front will be tracking
from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Plains by Friday,
although not as strong as the preceding system.  In its wake will
likely be a developing upper ridge centered over the Intermountain
West for next weekend, along with a weak upper low near California
that may bring some moisture northward across portions of the
Desert Southwest.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest deterministic guidance is in better agreement through
Friday across most of the continental U.S. compared to this time
yesterday.  The long wave trough crossing the Midwest is forecast
to evolve into a slower moving closed upper low over the Ohio
Valley, and thus a slightly slower cold front progression compared
to earlier forecasts, with the ECMWF the slowest solution here.
By Friday night, the GFS is a bit faster with the next shortwave
trough crossing the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, but still
within the ensemble spread.  Confidence decreases more
significantly by next Sunday with greater timing differences noted
in northern stream flow across the northeast Pacific and near the
Canadian border, and also regarding the extent of the upper ridge
over the Intermountain West.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily based on a nearly
equal blend of the latest available deterministic guidance through
Thursday, with slightly more weighting on the 12Z UKMET given its
middle ground solution with the closed low over the Ohio Valley
that is also close to the ICON and JMA models.  More of the
ensemble means were incorporated for the second half of the
forecast period owing to increased model spread across the
northern tier.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

A corridor of moderate to heavy rainfall is becoming increasingly
likely from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast U.S. for the
Wednesday through early Friday time period.  The potential exists
for widespread 1-3 inch rainfall totals, with isolated amounts up
to 4 inches possible over a two day period.  Much of this rainfall
will be associated with the upper level flow that develops, and
some instances of flooding may become realized if higher rainfall
rates repeatedly affect the same areas and for those regions with
saturated soils.  There may be some strong thunderstorms as well,
but the overall severe potential appears limited for now.

In terms of temperatures, it will be pleasantly cool behind the
cold front across the Midwest and the Ohio Valley for the middle
of the week, and the cold front should make it to the East Coast
by Friday along with improving humidity levels.  A warming trend
is likely to commence across much of the western U.S. by next
weekend in response to a building upper level ridge, with highs
expected to be on the order of 10 to 20 degrees above normal
across the western High Plains next Sunday.  Meanwhile,
temperatures should be close to seasonal averages for the eastern
half of the nation for this same time period.

...Strong to severe thunderstorms possible across portions of the
Plains and Midwest Sunday and Monday....

...Areas of heavy rain likely with flash flooding possible from
the Mid-South to the Southeast Sunday and Monday...

...Critical fire weather conditions possible for portions of
Northern California beginning late Sunday...

A strong cold front will continue to push across the western into
the central U.S., with below-normal temperatures and wet
conditions spreading from the Northwest into the northern Rockies
on Sunday.  Showers and storms are forecast to develop along the
front as it moves into the northern Plains and Upper Midwest, with
scattered strong storms expected across portions of the eastern
Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota late Sunday afternoon into the
evening.  Ahead of the front, daytime temperatures are expected to
climb well into the 80s/90s across the Plains and Midwest on
Sunday -- more than 20 degrees above normal for portions of the
Upper Midwest.

The front will push farther east into the upper to mid Mississippi
and lower Missouri valleys on Monday.  Storms are expected to
develop once again along the front, with strong thunderstorms
possible from portions of the Upper Midwest and the northern Great
Lakes to the lower Missouri Valley and central Plains Monday
afternoon and evening.  In addition to damaging winds, heavy rains
with isolated flash flooding are possible.

Meanwhile in the West, the front is expected to push south into
the Southwest by Sunday, with high pressure settling in over the
Great Basin and Rockies Monday and Tuesday.  This will support
offshore winds across California, with temperatures quickly
rebounding across much of the western U.S. Monday and Tuesday.  A
Fire Weather Watch beginning late Sunday is in effect for portions
of Northern California.

Mid level disturbances associated with the remnants of tropical
cyclone Nicholas will continue to interact with a very moist
airmass that remains in place from the Gulf Coast into the
Southeast, and the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys.  These are
expected to produce additional rounds of heavy rain across the
region.  Flash flood watches are in effect from the Mid-South to
portions of eastern Tennessee and western Georgia.  Given the
recent heavy amounts that have already occurred over the past day,
WPC has highlighted portions of northern Alabama and Middle
Tennessee with a Moderate Risk for Flash Flooding on Sunday --
indicating that numerous flash floods are likely in the region.

As the threat for heavy rain and flash flooding is expected to
continue across portions of the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys,
upper level disturbances moving farther to the east are forecast
to support an increasing threat for heavy rain and flash flooding
along the Southeast coast from North Florida to South Carolina on
Monday.

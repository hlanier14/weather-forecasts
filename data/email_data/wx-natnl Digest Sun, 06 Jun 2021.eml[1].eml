Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Sat Jun 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA SOUTHWEST NEW
MEXICO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST UTAH...

...Southwest Utah...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are forecast to develop
this afternoon and evening across the high country of southwestern
Utah. Hi-res ensemble guidance shows better agreement on stronger
surface winds developing across the Great Basin and Southwest.
Low-level westerly flow of 20-30 mph appears likely to overlap with
low RH of 10-20% and very dry fuels.

...Southeast Oregon and southern Idaho...
In addition to the widespread elevated fire weather conditions
expected today across much of the area, a corridor of more localized
critical fire weather potential may develop from the lee of the
Cascades into the Snake River Valley. With increasing flow aloft
overspreading the region, low-level surface winds may approach 25
mph this afternoon. With widespread surface RH of 15-25% and drier
than average low and mid-elevation fuels, locally critical fire
weather conditions appear possible. Limited confidence in the
spatial extent of critical conditions will preclude any additional
highlights at this time.

...Northern US...
Locally elevated/critical conditions may occur across portions of
the Michigan UP to northern Minnesota where very anomalously dry
fuels exist. Despite the impressive fuel load, flow aloft is
forecast to remain weak. Limited spatial coverage of meteorological
fire weather conditions will exist, suggesting any fire weather
threat will remain local in nature.

..Lyons.. 06/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0247 AM CDT Sat Jun 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper ridge across the contiguous United States will weaken
slightly on Saturday, as a short-wave trough moves across the
interior Pacific Northwest and a cut-off low across the
south-central United States begins to open and lift northward. A
cold front associated with the Pacific Northwest trough will move
east-southeast through the forecast period, ending up stretched from
northern California east-northeast into central Wyoming by early
Sunday morning.

... Southeast Arizona Southwest New Mexico ...

Widespread critical fire weather conditions are possible across
portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico today. Guidance
continues to show a belt of increased lower-tropospheric flow moving
across the area from west to east in the presence of a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer. The result will be strong, gusty westerly
surface winds of up to 30 mph coincident with minimum afternoon
relative humidity falling into the 5-15% range.

... Great Basin to the Southwest and Surrounding Areas ...

As the aforementioned Pacific Northwest trough approaches the area,
mid-level flow will strengthen, particularly across the northern
Great Basin. The dry lower troposphere in place coupled with strong
diurnal heating will combine to support a deep, well-mixed boundary
layer this afternoon, resulting in surface relative humidity falling
into the 5-15% range. The resulting steep lower-tropospheric lapse
rates will support downward momentum transport. The result will be
several hours of winds around 20 mph. Across eastern portions of the
Great Basin, enough residual moisture may persist to allow for
afternoon thunderstorms, especially across portions of Utah.
However, overall coverage should be less than in recent days.

... Northern Rockies ...

Strong mid-level flow of at least 60 knots will overspread the
region tomorrow afternoon as the western upper trough moves through
the area. Downward momentum transport within a relatively dry
boundary layer will foster widespread 15-25 mph sustained westerly
surface winds and 15-25% RH.

...Early season heatwave across the north-central states...

...Additional heavy rain for portions of the Gulf Coast...

A vast portion of the northern U.S. will continue to be impacted
by an early season heat wave thanks to a large upper-level ridge
that is anchored over the the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Afternoon highs are forecast to range from the 90s to low triple
digits from the Montana to Minnesota, which may tie or set new
daily temperature records. The heat will be subdued as a cold
front enters the region on Sunday and lowers the temperature to
the 70s and 80s across the High Plains to the Upper Mississippi
Valley. A few locations may stay near the 90s across the Upper
Midwest.

For the Desert Southwest, hot and mostly dry conditions are
expected. Daily temperature readings will likely range in the 100s
to 110s. Cloud cover and areas of rain over much of the southern
tier of the country will help keep somewhat cooler temperatures in
place. Moderate to heavy rainfall will make its way across the
western/central Gulf Coast and the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Numerous showers and thunderstorms may bring 2 to 5+ inches of
rain to parts of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi as a
slow-moving upper low migrates over the Southern
Plains/South-Central U.S. Additionally, rain showers are expected
for the Cascades in the Pacific Northwest as a couple of Pacific
disturbances move onshore.

...Much Above Normal Temperatures Continue Into Next Week from the
Northern Rockies/Plains to Northeast....
...Locally Heavy Rainfall Possible Next Week Across Lower/Mid
Mississippi...Tennessee...and Ohio Valleys...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The weather overview for the nation into next week will be the
continuation of much above normal to near record warmth across the
northern tier of U.S., particularly across the northern
Rockies/Plains to Northeast and New England. Uncertain energies to
work into the West/Northwest offers modest rainfall across that
region and a possible stronger/wetter downstream convective focus
for the northern Rockies and north-central U.S. near a wavy front.
Another highlight will be some threat of locally heavy rainfall
next week for the lower to middle Mississippi River Valley that
will gradually spread to the Midwest/Mid-Atlantic during the week.

Latest model guidance is in fairly good agreement with the upper
level pattern over the lower 48 featuring a West Coast cooling
longwave mean trough and a strong Bermuda ridge. Most short range
energy with a ridge embedded upper trough over the south-central
U.S. should lift to the Midwest and slowly lose focusing influence
for unsettled weather through the end of the upcoming work week.
Meanwhile, hot upper ridging gradually builds up over the
west-central U.S. as downstream upper troughing digs over the heat
moderating Northeast and Midwest/Great Lakes. The greatest model
differences are evident mid-later next week with the evolution of
various shortwave troughs moving through the longwave trough over
the eastern Pacific into the western U.S.. Differences have
recently become more of a run continuity issue between 00/06 UTC
guidance and more amplified and less progressive 12/18 UTC
guidance, but the latest differences are smaller than yesterdays.
The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian composite model blend days 3/4 (Tue/Wed)
before transitioning to mainly the compatible GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means by days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The interaction of deep/moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico with
weakening surface boundaries up from the western/central Gulf
Coast and lingering upper troughing will continue to provide
episodes of heavy rainfall and possible flash flooding across the
ArkLaTex and Lower/Mid Mississippi River Valley where the greatest
risk area for several inches of rainfall totals exists. Over time
next week, the system is forecast to weaken and lift northward
which will bring numerous to widespread showers and thunderstorms
to portions of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes regions, which
could produce some locally heavy rainfall. Additional energies
digging into the region may act to further organize activity later
period. Activity will also spread downstream in this pattern into
the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic as aided with advance of a
temperature moderating backdoor cold front.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat June 05 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Sat Jun 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN GREAT BASIN...

...Northern and central Great Basin into the Southwest...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely across
portions of Nevada and western Utah through the afternoon. Surface
winds will increase substantially during the afternoon as mid-level
flow moves over the Great Basin. Widespread 20-30 mph sustained
surface winds with higher gusts are likely. A warm and very dry
airmass with RH below 15% will also accompany the stronger winds
supporting widespread critical fire weather conditions. The previous
critical area was expanded across southern Nevada and into western
Utah to match the latest guidance.

Farther south across Arizona and New Mexico, widespread elevated and
locally critical fire weather conditions will likely develop along
the southern fringes of strong flow aloft. Terrain enhancement will
favor winds of 15-20 mph through the afternoon atop a low RH of
15-20% and very dry fuels.

..Lyons.. 06/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0248 AM CDT Sat Jun 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The Pacific Northwest upper trough will begin to amplify on Sunday
in response to a stronger short-wave trough across the northeast
Pacific Ocean. As the broader trough responds, another in a series
of short-wave troughs will move through the Pacific Northwest upper
trough on Sunday, bringing enhanced mid-level flow. Another surface
cold front will push east-southeast on Sunday, ending up across
northern California, northern Nevada, and southeastern Idaho.

... Northern Great Basin ...

Strong diurnal heating within a dry lower troposphere will once
again result in a deep, well-mixed boundary layer on Sunday. This
will contribute to afternoon relative-humidity values falling into
the single digits to low teens. Additionally, downward momentum
transfer will support strong and gusty afternoon winds in the 20-30
mph range. The most likely area to experience sustained critical
fire-weather conditions on Sunday will be across far northern Nevada
where the overlap between strong diurnal heating and proximity to
enhanced mid-level flow associated with the short-wave trough is
maximized.

... Southeast Arizona and Southwest New Mexico ...

Widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions will
be possible across portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico on
Sunday. Guidance continues to show a belt of increased
lower-tropospheric flow across the area -- albeit weaker than on
Saturday -- in the presence of a deep, well-mixed boundary layer.
The result will be strong, gusty westerly surface winds of up to 20
mph coincident with minimum afternoon relative humidity falling into
the 5-15% range.

... Northern Plains ...

Strong mid-level flow of at least 60 knots will overspread the

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Next Week Across Tennessee/Ohio River
Valleys and Central Appalachians...
...Much Above Normal Temperatures Continue Across the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Much above normal to near record warmth will continue next week
for portions of the northern Rockies/Plains and the Upper Midwest
while unsettled weather associated with a weak upper level low
could spell locally heavy rainfall across the Tennessee and Ohio
River Valleys as well as portions of the central Appalachians to
Mid-Atlantic late in the week into next weekend. Finally, a
stronger storm system approaching the West Coast is expected to
bring precipitation and unsettled weather to northern California,
Oregon, and Washington State.

The greatest model spread and uncertainty across the CONUS lies
with the progression and depth of troughing over the western U.S.
and how embedded shortwaves eject out into the northern Rockies
and northern Plains. The latest model guidance looked reasonably
clustered for this forecast cycle through much of the period,
however the 05.18Z GFS was not considered at all given its much
faster progression and evolution of the trough over the West. The
12Z run was much better aligned to the rest of the guidance as
well as both the ECENS and GEFS means. The more amplified and
slower solution is favored and this is why the faster/progressive
18Z GFS run was considered an outlier. Looking at the latest
/06.00Z/ run of the GFS, it has considerably slowed down shortwave
energy progression late next week and is in line more with the
other deterministic and ensemble guidance, so it offers some
utility in later forecasts. Elsewhere, model guidance showed
average to above average predictability with ridging persistent
across the southern to southeast U.S. while some troughing is
forecast to drop into portions of New England and the Northeast.
This will keep the northern tier and portions of the central U.S.
on the more active/unsettled weather side. The WPC blend
incorporated mostly 05.12Z model data consisting of the
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET/GFS while introducing more of the ECENS/GEFS means
late in the forecast period to account for some of the greater
spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Locally heavy rainfall will remain possible across portions of the
Tennessee and lower Ohio River Valleys for the middle of the work
week and this unsettled weather is forecast to then spread toward
the Mid-Atlantic by late in the week as it interacts with a
backdoor cold front. Meanwhile, much above normal to near record
warmth will continue across the northern Rockies/Plains with some
periodic convective episodes as storm systems come out of the
northern Rockies. A storm system approaching the West Coast will
bring precipitation to portions of northern California, Oregon,
and Washington State late in the week into next weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
A broad Pacific Northwest upper-level trough is forecast to persist
over the Eastern Pacific Ocean through today, as an embedded
short-wave trough along its southern/eastern periphery gradually
weakens while shifting onshore. An associated belt of stronger
mid-level westerly flow is forecast along/near the base of the
large-scale trough from Oregon/Northern California northeastward to
North Dakota.

...Great Basin...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely across much
of Nevada, far northwestern Arizona, and southwestern Utah today. As
the aforementioned enhanced mid-level flow impinges on the area
during the afternoon, a deep, well-mixed boundary layer will promote
sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph (with stronger gusts) amidst
critical minimum RH values (e.g., 15%) and increasingly dry fuels.
Of additional concern is the potential for lightning holdover fires
from isolated dry thunderstorms the past few days. Cloud-to-ground
lightning data suggest the greatest potential for holdover fires is
across central Nevada.

...Northern Plains...
Elevated meteorological fire weather conditions appear likely across
portions of northeastern Montana into western/central North Dakota
this afternoon with sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph and minimum
RH values near 20-25%. However, a large part of this area received
0.25 inches or more of rainfall within the last 12 hours and/or is
forecast to into tomorrow morning. Thus, the coverage of elevated
fire weather conditions remains somewhat uncertain and the Elevated
area may need to be adjusted (or even removed) in future outlooks.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN NEVADA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL/SOUTHERN
NEVADA AND SOUTHWESTERN UTAH...

...Synopsis...
A broad mid/upper-level Pacific Northwest trough is forecast to
amplify offshore through Day 2/Monday, which will allow the area of
enhanced mid-level flow near its base to become increasingly
meridional. Meanwhile, a secondary upper-level trough is forecast to
shift onshore across portions of southern California and into the
four corners area through the day.

...Great Basin...
Two primary areas of critical fire weather conditions are expected
Day 2/Monday across the Great Basin.

1. Northwestern Nevada
Critical fire weather conditions are likely across portions of
northwestern Nevada during the afternoon/evening as the
aforementioned area of enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
broad Pacific Northwest trough remains over the area. Sustained
surface winds in excess of 20 mph are expected to overlap critical
minimum RH values (e.g., < 15%) and dry fuels.

2. Central/Southern Nevada and southwest Utah
Critical fire weather conditions are also likely across portions of
the southern Great Basin Day 2/Monday afternoon and evening as
enhanced mid-level flow from the aforementioned secondary
upper-level trough overspreads the area. Sustained surface winds of
20-30 mph and minimum RH values near 10-15% are expected amidst
increasingly dry fuels. Lightning holdover fires are also possible
from dry thunderstorms the past few days. Cloud-to-ground
lightning data suggest the greatest potential for holdover fires is
across central Nevada.

...Remaining quite warm from the Upper Midwest to the East Coast...

...Additional heavy rain for portions of the Gulf Coast...

High temperatures will continue to be more reminiscent of the
middle of summer instead of early June across much of the
north-central U.S. for Sunday and Monday, although there should be
some abatement compared to the record setting heat over the past
few days.  Highs in the upper 80s to upper 90s will be commonplace
from South Dakota to Michigan and northern parts of the Ohio
Valley.  The East Coast region will also get its fair share of hot
and humid conditions as the Bermuda High remains anchored
offshore.  It will also be quite hot across the Desert Southwest
with 100-110 degree readings expected for the lower elevations.
It will not be as hot across Texas and the Deep South owing to a
weak upper low and abundant cloud cover and rainfall.

Another thing making weather headlines for Sunday will be
additional heavy rainfall across the central Gulf Coast region,
particularly from New Orleans to southern Alabama.  Moisture rich
flow from the Gulf of Mexico will intercept a weak low level
boundary over this region, and promote the development of numerous
showers and storms through Saturday, with the potential for up to
three inches of rain that may result in some instances of
flooding.  Heavy rain is also expected across the ArkLaTex region
in connection with the slow moving upper low, and for the Cascades
as a couple of Pacific disturbances pass through the region.  In
terms of severe weather potential, the Storm Prediction Center has
a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for Monday across portions
of the Dakotas as a well defined surface low and front intercepts
a warm and unstable airmass across this region.

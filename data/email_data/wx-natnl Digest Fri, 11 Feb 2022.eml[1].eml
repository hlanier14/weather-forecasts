Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update. Despite minimum afternoon RH remaining in the 25
to 35 percent range across parts of KS and NE, breezy/gusty
west-southwesterly winds could support localized/brief elevated
fire-weather conditions today. However, these conditions appear too
marginal and localized to introduce an Elevated area at this time.

..Weinman.. 02/10/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Thu Feb 10 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will overspread the CONUS as a surface
cyclone approaches the Great Lakes and a cold front moves southeast
across the northern Plains. Relatively cooler temperatures and
resultant higher RH in proximity to the cold front should limit
wildfire spread potential across the central/northern Plains. Drier
surface air is expected across the southern High Plains, but the
lack of an appreciable surface wind field should also limit wildfire
spread concerns here as well.

Dry offshore flow is expected to continue across southern
California, with Elevated to occasionally Critical meteorological
surface conditions likely. Nonetheless, fuels are poorly receptive
to fire spread on a widespread basis, with no fire weather
highlights introduced.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather significant pattern change is coming early next week as a
strong trough, originating over the Gulf of Alaska, drops
southeastward across the West Coast region.  This will abruptly
replace the long-standing upper ridge that will be over the
western third of the nation through this weekend, which is
expected to lead to surface cyclogenesis by the middle of next
week across the western High Plains.  This will tend to displace
the ridge axis farther east across the Plains, although less
amplified than before, and resulting in more of a quasi-zonal flow
pattern across much of the central and eastern U.S. as the deep
upper trough over the East Coast region lifts out by early-mid
next week.  Additionally, there will be an offshore low that
develops off the East Coast for late Sunday and then lifts
northeastward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, with increasing
chances for snow across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z deterministic model guidance is in very good agreement on
the expected synoptic scale evolution of the western U.S. trough
that builds in for early next week.  However, there are still some
model differences with shortwave energy crossing the eastern U.S.
through early Monday and its role in offshore surface
cyclogenesis.  The latest 12z CMC run was too fast and weak
compared to the other 12z deterministic runs, with respect to the
Pacific shortwave arriving over the West Coast on Monday. By
Tuesday it appears to form a pair of embedded closed lows within
the same trough. By Wednesday, it comes into better agreement with
the other models. The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a general model blend through Monday, and then
gradually increasing percentages of the means through the middle
of next week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An offshore low is expected to develop along the exiting cold
front on Sunday as shortwave energy from an approaching upper
level trough induces cyclogenesis.  There has been some run-to-run
variance in the guidance over the past 24 hours, but this still
keeps the majority of the precipitation off the coast.  However,
some snow is becoming increasingly likely for portions of eastern
New England and also across parts of the Delmarva and into
Virginia.  This may begin as a cold rain before changing to snow.
Later in the forecast period across the central U.S., widespread
showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop by Wednesday into
Thursday as the surface low develops further across the Plains and
advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Mississippi/Tennessee Valley and Southeast, with some
strong storms possible in this type of synoptic scale set-up.
There may also be some accumulating snow on the northern periphery
of this low pressure system across portions of the Midwest and
Great Lakes.

In terms of temperatures, below average readings are expected by
Sunday and into early next week for the eastern U.S. as the strong
cold front ushers in a renewed round of cold weather.  Highs up to
20 degrees below normal are possible for portions of the Great
Lakes region this weekend.  It should be mild once again across
most of the Plains for Sunday and into Monday with the West Coast
region beginning to cool down with the trough building in, after
anomalous warmth across portions of California this weekend.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather significant pattern change is coming early next week as a
strong trough, originating over the Gulf of Alaska, drops
southeastward across the West Coast region.  This will abruptly
replace the long-standing upper ridge that will be over the
western third of the nation through this weekend, which is
expected to lead to surface cyclogenesis by the middle of next
week across the western High Plains.  This will tend to displace
the ridge axis farther east across the Plains, although less
amplified than before, and resulting in more of a quasi-zonal flow
pattern across much of the central and eastern U.S. as the deep
upper trough over the East Coast region lifts out by early-mid

...Strong Canadian frontal system to bring rain showers and light
to moderate snowfall from the Northern Plains to the Northeast...

...High winds expected from the Northern High Plains to the
Dakotas through this evening...

...Early taste of spring across most of the lower 48; cooler
temperatures return to the Midwest on Saturday with a blast of
Arctic air...

During the short-range period the main weather story will be
focused around a Canadian low pressure/frontal system geared up to
bring rain and snow to northeast quadrant of the CONUS. Steered
ahead by a robust, deepening upper-level trough, the low pressure
system is forecast to dive south into the Upper Midwest this
evening, delivering the most notable snowfall to the northern
portions of Minnesota and Wisconsin as well as northern and
eastern Michigan. Winter Weather Advisories are currently in
effect for these areas. At the surface, wind gusts up to 75 mph
may develop where downsloping winds interact with a sharp pressure
gradient to the southwest of the system. High Wind Warnings are
currently in effect over central Montana as these winds may kick
up and blow dust over the region, thereby reducing visibility at
times. Further east over the Dakotas a slightly weaker pressure
gradient could also contribute to the development of strong winds
with gusts up to 55 mph, prompting the issuance of Wind Advisories
for both states. As the system progress eastward rain and snow
showers will spread from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the
Northeast on Friday before pushing south into the Tennessee Valley
and Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. Outside of the Upper Midwest only
minimal snowfall accumulations are likely, save for isolated areas
of upstate New York downwind of the Lower Great Lakes where
moderate lake effect snow showers are expected.

Elsewhere, warmer air behind the aforementioned low pressure
system will keep most of the precipitation over the Plains falling
as rain until the early hours of Friday morning when an influx of
cooler temperatures behind the first of two cold fronts will allow
for a transition from rain to snow. As the pair of cold fronts
continue their southward dive on Friday appreciable snowfall
totals of around 4 to 6 inches are expected over the Black Hills
of South Dakota and Bighorn Mountains in Wyoming. Light snowfall
accumulations are anticipated for the much of the Central/Southern
Rockies and neighboring High Plains.

Temperature-wise much of the lower 48 will continue to enjoy
unseasonably warm temperatures around 5 to 10 degrees above
average to close out the week. Daily highs throughout California
and southern Oregon are forecast to remain at record breaking
level well into the weekend, sizzling at around 20 to 25 degrees
above normal. With temperatures expected to reach the high 80s and
low 90s throughout southern California, Heat Advisories remain in
effect from the Los Angeles metro area to the San Diego metro
area. In addition to the Heat Advisories, High Wind Warnings and
Wind Advisories have been issued for much of southeastern
California due to a favorable pattern for the development of the
Santa Ana winds, which can produce gusts up to 65 mph. Farther
east, winter-like temperatures will return to the Great Plains,
Midwest, and Mississippi Valley on Saturday as Arctic air is
ejected southward behind a series of cold fronts. While
temperatures in the Great Plains will sit only moderately below
normal, significant departures between 15 and 30 degrees below
average will be felt in the Upper Midwest and Middle Mississippi
Valley. Temperatures will be so cold over portions Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan on Saturday that high temperatures will
struggle to reach double digits or, in the hardest hit areas, rise
above zero degrees.

300 PM EST February 10 2022

SYNOPSIS: Late in week-1, there is good agreement in the dynamical models
favoring the development of mid-level low pressure over the central CONUS,
which could result in surface low formation over the Great Plains. This
predicted surface feature has the potential for triggering heavy precipitat=
ion
across parts of the eastern lower 48, as well as possible heavy snow from t=
he
Midwest to the interior Northeast early in week-2. Over Alaska, the prevail=
ing
mid-level height pattern supports the potential for much below-normal
temperatures across much of the Mainland throughout week-2, with heavy
precipitation, high elevation snow, and high winds possible across the
Southeast Mainland and the Panhandle in the first half of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of the Alaska Mainla=
nd
and eastern Aleutians, Fri-Thu, Feb 18-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across much of the eastern CONUS, Fri, F=
eb
18.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of southeast Mainland Alask=
a
and the Panhandle, Fri-Mon, Feb 18-21.

Slight risk of heavy snow for portions of the northern Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast Fri, Feb 18.

Slight risk of heavy snow for high-elevation areas of southeast Mainland
Alaska
and the Panhandle, Fri-Mon, Feb 18-21.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the eastern CONUS, Fri-Sat, Feb 18-19=

Slight risk of high winds for coastal areas of the southern Alaska Mainland
and
Panhandle, Feb 18-21.

f2pll0BAc4S$

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 18 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 24: Today's GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian mean 500-hPa height forecasts continue to favor highly amplified
ridging over the Northeast Pacific, with mean troughing over the east-centr=
al
CONUS tied to a strong transient shortwave disturbance downstream early in
week-2. After this transient disturbance exits the East Coast early in the
period, another smaller transient surface low pressure system has the
potential
to quickly traverse across the Northern Tier. These low pressure systems ar=
e
likely to lead to brief influxes of cooler than normal temperatures followi=
ng
their passages early in week-2, before temperatures begin to moderate throu=
gh
the remainder of the period. Despite the brief periods of below-normal
temperatures early in the period, negative minimum temperature anomalies ar=
e
not expected to reach hazardous criteria across the eastern CONUS.



Early in week-2, the aforementioned strong surface low over the east-centra=
l
CONUS is forecast to move northeastward, tracking from the Middle Mississip=
pi
and Lower Ohio Valleys to the Northeast. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
continue to feature return flow from the Gulf to provide ample moisture acr=
oss
the eastern third of the CONUS, where there is good agreement in the
uncalibrated guidance depicting elevated mean precipitation amounts. The
highest daily mean amounts are favored in the warm sector across much of th=
e
eastern CONUS, supporting the continuation of a slight risk of heavy
precipitation on Feb 18 from the Mississippi Valley to the Eastern Seaboard=
,
as
this system progresses northeastward. With cold air advection likely on the
backside of the low and enhanced moisture favored in the deterministic and
ensemble guidance over the northeastern CONUS, a slight risk of heavy snow
remains issued for Feb 18 from the Midwest to the interior Northeast. The
storm
track in the ensemble guidance has been tracking northwestward a bit since
yesterday, leading to the potential rain/snow line being shifted
northwestward,
relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook. Additionally, th=
e passage of this strong
low
pressure system is expected to be conducive for elevated winds for many are=
as
east of the Mississippi both ahead of it and on its back side. Therefore, a
slight risk of high winds remains issued for the eastern third of the CONUS
from Feb 18 to 19.



Over Alaska, there is good agreement between today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
model guidance depicting below-normal mid-level heights across much of the
Alaska Mainland. This is in contrast to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs modeled mean mid-level
height anomalies, where the GEFS predicted positive height departures over
much
of the Mainland. Despite the increased agreement in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs forecast
negative
mid-level height anomalies, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast too=
ls
indicate a general reduction in coverage in their respective cold signals,
with
the coldest temperatures now favored across the more northern and western
portions of the Alaska Mainland. Given the diminished anomalous cold signal=
s,
relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 outlook, the corre=
sponding slight risk for
much
below-normal minimum temperatures was also reduced in coverage to match mor=
e
closely with areas where there is at least a 20% for minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile. Thus, a slight risk of much below-normal
temperatures remains issued for week-2, but reduced in coverage, especially
over the interior Mainland.



Across southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, increased onshore fl=
ow
is expected to promote above-normal precipitation over the region. Both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day tot=
als
exceeding the 85th percentile and two inches to support the continuation of=
 a
slight risk of heavy precipitation and high-elevation heavy snow early in t=
he
period. However, in contrast to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-=
2 outlook, the ECMWF now
falls
more in line with the GEFS in depicting an increased duration of storm
activity
in the Gulf of Alaska. Therefore, the slight risks for heavy precipitation =
and
heavy snow are now valid through Feb 21. The strong onshore flow along the
coast from the southern Mainland to the Panhandle also warrants a slight ri=
sk
for high winds through Feb 21, supported by the GEFS the ECMWF reforecast
tools, which indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85=
th
percentile and 40 mph.



Due to antecedent wet conditions in southeastern Alaska, where some locatio=
ns
have experienced more than twice their normal precipitation for the year, t=
he
continuation of above-normal precipitation during week-2 is expected to
adversely affect the highlighted region and raises the concern for landslid=
es
in the low elevations. The increased risk for high winds may also exacerbat=
e
landslide potential.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 PM CST Thu Feb 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

An Elevated area was added for parts of the central and southern
Plains for Day 2/Friday. As a cold front moves southward across the
region during the late morning/early afternoon, 20-30 mph sustained
northerly winds (with gusts up to 40 mph) will overspread parts of
southern NE, KS, OK, the TX Panhandle, and northern/west-central TX.
Weak cold air advection behind the front combined with downslope
warming/drying off the Rockies will result in minimum afternoon RH
of 20-30 percent across the post-frontal airmass. A brief overlap of
the strong surface winds and low RH is expected across the
aforementioned areas tomorrow afternoon, warranting the introduction
of the Elevated area. Presently, confidence in the strong winds
overlapping critically low RH for at least 3 hours is limited,
though a Critical area could be needed with subsequent outlooks if
these conditions appear to last longer than currently anticipated.
This would most likely be the case over parts of KS and OK, where
fuels are very dry (ERCs in the 70th-80th percentile). Farther south
ahead of the approaching front, elevated conditions will also be
possible primarily south of the TX Trans Pecos region, though fuels
are only modestly receptive to the spread of wildfires -- precluding
highlights at this time.

Across southern California, a brief weakening of the regional
pressure gradient is expected on Day 2/Friday. However, continued
dry, offshore flow will support periods of locally elevated
conditions along the coastal ranges and adjacent foothills
(particularly across Ventura County). At this time, these conditions
appear too localized to introduce an Elevated area. The pressure
gradient will strengthen once again on Day 3/Saturday into early Day
4/Sunday, resulting in a probable increase in the fire-weather risk
this weekend.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough embedded in the larger scale 500 mb northwesterly
flow is expected to amplify while surging southeast across the
central and southern Plains in tandem with a surface cold front
tomorrow/Friday. Windy conditions are expected across the central
and southern Plains, where fuels in several locales are highly
receptive to wildfire spread. At the moment though, the latest suite
of available guidance lacks consensus in low-level moisture
depiction, with minimum RH varying from 15-35 percent across the
central Plains. As such, fire weather highlights have been withheld.
Elevated or Critical highlights may be added across portions of the
central Plains in future outlooks should guidance consensus trend
drier. 15-25 percent RH should overspread the southern High Plains
by afternoon peak heating given downslope flow, though surface winds
appear too weak to add Elevated highlights this outlook.

Dry offshore flow should persist across southern California, though
poorly receptive fuels should limit widespread significant wildfire
concerns.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 16 - 20 2022

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on the 500-hPa flow
pattern across most of the forecast domain. All models predict a ridge over
the
Northeast Pacific associated with positive height anomalies over southern
Alaska, in much of western Canada, and over the western CONUS; however, all
models are flatter, a little weaker, and slightly farther south with the ri=
dge
compared to yesterday, resulting in below normal 500-hPa heights over centr=
al
and northern Alaska. Today's models also forecast a large-scale trough
trailing
from eastern Canada into the north-central and southwestern CONUS downstrea=
m
from the ridge, but two differences exist compared to yesterday; the trough=
 is
flatter than yesterday - consistent with a broader and flatter upstream rid=

-
and the 500-hPa trough is more separated into two anomaly centers - one ove=
r
the southwestern CONUS and another in central and eastern Canada. Downstrea=
m
from these features, all models point to ridging over the eastern CONUS wit=
h
positive 500-hPa anomalies stretching across most of the mid-latitudes of t=
he
North Atlantic. Models disagree on how much the 500-hPa in the southwestern
CONUS is separated from the troughing and below-normal heights in central a=
nd
eastern Canada. The operational 0z European is most dramatic with this
separation, extending positive 500-hPa anomalies across the entire northern
CONUS, connecting the northeast Pacific positive anomalies to the anomalous
ridging in the eastern CONUS and North Atlantic. Most other models keep som=
e
troughing and negative 500-hPa height anomalies from the north-central CONU=
S
into the Southwest, though all show two separate centers of negative 500-hP=
a
anomalies, the European ensembles from 0z lean toward the operational
European.
Today's manual 500-hPa blend favors the ECMWF ensemble mean solution for
several reasons. Teleconnections based on the positive height anomaly cente=
red
in the northeastern Pacific supports the separate negative height anomaly
centers in the southwest CONUS and central through eastern Canada, but with=
out
positive height anomalies across the northern CONUS separating the mid-leve=
l
flow into two distinct streams. Also, the weights used in the forecast
consolidation tool indicate that the ECMWF ensemble temperature and
precipitation forecasts have been more skillful during this season last yea=
r
and in the recent past.

Above normal temperatures are favored along the west coast of the CONUS
underneath positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Cold air advection behind a c=
old
front originating from Canada increases the likelihood of near normal
temperatures for much of the Great Basin, Four Corners region, and Southern
Plains, with slightly elevated chances for below normal temperatures in the
far
southern Rockies near the center of the negative 500-hPa height anomaly. Ab=
ove
normal temperatures are favored over parts of the northern and central Plai=
ns,
towards the central and lower Mississippi Valley, due in part to downslopin=
g
low level winds towards the end of the period. Ridging and above normal
heights
support enhanced chances of near to above normal temperatures east of the
Mississippi. This is similar to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forec=
ast, but with better
chances
of above normal temperatures in the eastern CONUS. Southerly low level wind=
s
forecast for the Alaska Panhandle and southern portions of the Mainland
increase chances of above normal temperatures there while cold surface high
pressure favors below normal temperatures for parts of central and northern
Mainland Alaska. The odds favoring both these anomalies in Alaska are reduc=
ed
a
bit from yesterday, however, given the flatter, less-anomalous mid-level ri=
dge
expected in the northeastern Pacific.

East of the predicted Pacific ridge, dry conditions are likely, highly
favoring
below normal precipitation for much of the West. Meanwhile, a storm system =
is
predicted to develop over the higher terrain of the West early in the perio=
d
and track eastward across the country, favoring above normal precipitation =
for
much of the eastern and southern CONUS. However, near to below normal
precipitation is favored for parts of the Northern Plains, well to the nort=
h
of
the predicted storm track. One or more storm systems are predicted to cross
over Alaska during the period, favoring near to above normal precipitation =
for
the state.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Slightly above average, 3 out =
of
5, due to fairly good agreement between model forecasts on the mean
circulation
pattern over most of the domain, which has also been consistent from run to
run. This is offset by the disagreements among the temperature tools in the
western half of the CONUS, although the array of solutions is not as broad =
as
yesterday.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 18 - 24 2022

During the week-2 period, models depict more zonal flow, considerably less
amplified than yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs expected mean pattern.=
 Ridges in northern
portions
of both the North Pacific and North Atlantic Oceans flatten, reducing and
pushing southward the positive 500-hPa height anomalies there. As a result,
troughing and negative height anomalies in the southwestern CONUS also
decrease, with modest positive height anomalies extending almost all of the
CONUS. The flattening ridge and more zonal flow keep anomalously low 500-hP=
a
heights across most of Canada and Alaska. A trough is enhanced with below
normal 500hPa heights over Alaska. Most models agree on this mean pattern,
with
the European ensemble means keeping the largest positive height anomalies
across the Rockies and interior western CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean. The
ECMWF ensemble mean is favored in the week-2 period for the same reasons it=
's
favored in the  6-10 day period.

Increasing heights predicted over most of the CONUS leads to increased chan=
ces
of near to above normal temperatures for the entire CONUS. This also agrees
with expected MJO activity. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are
highest east of the Rockies and Great Basin due to predicted downloping low
level winds, and for the Eastern Seaboard due to persistent positive height
anomalies and southerly low level flow. Near to below normal temperatures f=
or
the Aleutians and most of Mainland Alaska are favored due to below normal
500hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Alas=
ka
Panhandle as onshore winds are forecast to persist during the week-2 period=
.
Equal temperature chances are pushed into southeast Mainland Alaska, in
agreement with the preferred European ensemble means.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over the western half of the
CONUS, downstream of the flattening ridging offshore of the West Coast and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending into the western CONUS. The sam=
e
storm system predicted to bring precipitation to parts of the eastern half =
of
the U.S. during the 6-10 day period is moving away from the CONUS during
week-2, so probabilities of above normal precipitation are not widespread a=
nd
relatively low. A front trailing from the system may linger over the
southeastern CONUS, slightly enhancing chances for above-normal precipitati=
on
there, and the potential for a fairly strong jet stream farther north -
between
the low 500-hPa heights across Canada and the above-normal heights across t=
he
CONUS - would mean an active storm track and mildly enhanced chances for
wetness there. Near to above normal precipitation is favored again for Alas=
ka
due to one or more possible storm systems, but the more zonal pattern expec=
ted
relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasts keeps increased=
 odds for wetter than
normal
weather out of northeastern Mainland Alaska


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
relatively good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern, offset by some disagreement among the temperature and precipitatio=
n
tools.

FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A rather significant pattern change is coming early next week as a
strong trough, originating over the Gulf of Alaska, drops
southeastward across the West Coast region.  This will abruptly
replace the long-standing upper ridge that will be over the
western third of the nation through this weekend, which is
expected to lead to surface cyclogenesis by the middle of next
week across the western High Plains.  This will tend to displace
the ridge axis farther east across the Plains, although less
amplified than before, and resulting in more of a quasi-zonal flow
pattern across much of the central and eastern U.S. as the deep
upper trough over the East Coast region lifts out by early-mid
next week.  Additionally, there will be an offshore low that
develops off the East Coast for late Sunday and then lifts
northeastward to Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, with increasing
chances for snow across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z deterministic model guidance is in very good agreement on
the expected synoptic scale evolution of the western U.S. trough
that builds in for early next week.  However, there are still some
model differences with shortwave energy crossing the eastern U.S.
through early Monday and its role in offshore surface
cyclogenesis.  The latest 12z CMC run was too fast and weak
compared to the other 12z deterministic runs, with respect to the
Pacific shortwave arriving over the West Coast on Monday. By
Tuesday it appears to form a pair of embedded closed lows within
the same trough. By Wednesday, it comes into better agreement with
the other models. The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily
derived from a general model blend through Monday, and then
gradually increasing percentages of the means through the middle
of next week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An offshore low is expected to develop along the exiting cold
front on Sunday as shortwave energy from an approaching upper
level trough induces cyclogenesis.  There has been some run-to-run
variance in the guidance over the past 24 hours, but this still
keeps the majority of the precipitation off the coast.  However,
some snow is becoming increasingly likely for portions of eastern
New England and also across parts of the Delmarva and into
Virginia.  This may begin as a cold rain before changing to snow.
Later in the forecast period across the central U.S., widespread
showers and thunderstorms are likely to develop by Wednesday into
Thursday as the surface low develops further across the Plains and
advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Mississippi/Tennessee Valley and Southeast, with some
strong storms possible in this type of synoptic scale set-up.
There may also be some accumulating snow on the northern periphery
of this low pressure system across portions of the Midwest and
Great Lakes.

In terms of temperatures, below average readings are expected by
Sunday and into early next week for the eastern U.S. as the strong
cold front ushers in a renewed round of cold weather.  Highs up to
20 degrees below normal are possible for portions of the Great
Lakes region this weekend.  It should be mild once again across
most of the Plains for Sunday and into Monday with the West Coast
region beginning to cool down with the trough building in, after
anomalous warmth across portions of California this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1232 AM CST Fri Feb 11 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected across parts of the
Plains today as winds increase behind a southward-surging cold
front. Fire weather concerns are also possible for parts of coastal
southern California where temperatures will remain well above
normal.

...Central Plains...
A cold front is noted across central NE in early-morning
observations. Most model solutions place this front through central
OK and into north TX by mid-day with only a modest post-frontal
temperature reduction. However, cold air advection just off the
surface combined with diurnal heating should support downward mixing
of 30-40 mph winds to the surface by mid/late afternoon from
southern NE into northern TX. Sustained winds near 20 mph and 20-30%
RH appear likely, but confidence remains somewhat low on the
propensity for sub-20% across the plains - mainly due to the
potential for low to mid-level clouds. Latest ensemble guidance and
drier solutions hint at the best potential for RH in the teens and
critical fire weather conditions across southwest KS into northwest
OK where cloud cover may be more limited. A Critical risk area may
be needed for this area if RH begins to trend towards the drier
solutions.

...Coastal Southern California...
Despite a weakening in the regional pressure gradient over the past
12 hours, offshore winds continue early Friday with 20-40 mph gusts
noted in the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. RH
values remain in the teens due to persistent downslope flow and
should remain depressed through the day along the southern CA coast.
Although winds will abate slightly, the continued offshore flow
coupled with near record temperatures will support at least a
low-end fire weather concern - especially in drier pockets with
reduced fine fuel moisture.

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 14 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 18 2022

...Precipitation chances increase mid- to late next week, with
heavy rain from the south-central to east-central U.S. and wintry
weather possible in the Midwest to interior Northeast...

...Overview...

Expect a significant pattern change next week, as a potent upper
low drops southeastward along the West Coast early in the workweek
and develops into a trough pushing into the central U.S. by the
latter half of the week. This upper pattern will lead to surface
cyclogenesis and strong frontal systems in the central U.S.,
drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing
notable precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into
Friday. Rain and thunderstorms are forecast in southern areas,
while snow and wintry weather are likely on the northern and
western side of the precipitation shield across central parts of
the Plains to Midwest/Great Lakes and interior Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 12/18Z cycle is quite agreeable with the
large scale pattern early in the week with the aforementioned
upper low moving through the West, especially considering its
origins over the Gulf of Alaska. Additionally, models agree in
principle that troughing in the East will lift and the ridging
across the West during the short range period should get pushed
eastward into the central U.S. around Tuesday and the East on
Wednesday while flattening somewhat. Thus a multi-model blend of
the 12Z ECMWF, CMC, UKMET, and 12/18Z GFS was utilized early in
the medium range period for the WPC forecast.

Around Wednesday into Thursday of next week is when greater
differences appear to arise, as additional shortwave energy rounds
a Pacific ridge earlier in the week and then enters the Northwest
around Wednesday. This shortwave and those farther north into
Canada show more variability from run to run and between models in
their evolution. The 12/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF runs showed
reasonably similar solutions as each other, with shortwaves in the
Southwest and in the southern High Plains within the broader
trough early Thursday, while the 12Z CMC indicated a more phased
solution with the shortwave tracking east joined with the northern
stream. Individual ensemble members show considerable variability
with the details, and 00Z guidance still demonstrates these
shortwave differences. The exact track and timing of the trough
and shortwaves within it will also affect the position of the cold
front and associated surface lows. However, the overall pattern is
still reasonably agreeable for a day 6-7 forecast. The WPC
forecast introduced and increased the proportion of the GEFS and
EC ensemble means for days 6-7 of the forecast to minimize
individual model differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

As the upper low/trough enters the western U.S. Monday,
precipitation chances will increase across the West, with
coastal/lower elevation rain and mountain snow, but totals should
remain light to moderate there. However, widespread showers and
thunderstorms are likely to develop by Wednesday into Thursday as
the surface low consolidates in the High Plains and advects
substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the
Plains, Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and eventually the
Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms could be possible along with flash
flooding concerns where heavy rainfall occurs, but with
uncertainty in the details of these potential threats at this
point. In the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the
system, accumulating snow is currently expected from central parts
of the Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest/Great
Lakes region into interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain.

The overall pattern change will be evident in temperatures next
week as well. Warmer than average temperatures across the Central
Great Basin and Southwest Monday will moderate to near normal
Tuesday and Wednesday underneath the incoming trough. Meanwhile
the central U.S. should see high temperatures 10-20F above normal
with lows 15-25F above normal Wednesday before these anomalies
shift east ahead of the trough and cold front into the Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys Thursday. The Eastern Seaboard can expect colder
than average temperatures by 10-20 degrees on Monday before
moderating as the week progresses to much above normal by Friday.

California through this weekend...

A strong low pressure system is currently pushing into the Upper
Great Lakes this morning before it is expected to exit into
southeast Canada by tonight. Gusty winds will be felt behind the
system throughout the Upper Midwest, along with the likelihood of
light snowfall. Blizzard Warnings are currently in effect for far
eastern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, where widespread
blowing snow may significantly reduce visibility at times.
Additionally, light snow will spread along and behind a cold front
as it traverses over the Great Lakes region today, with rain
showers possible farther south across the Midwest and Ohio Valley.
The greatest snowfall amounts (up to 6 inches) are forecast
downwind of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan. The associated cold
front will also extend across the Great Plains and potentially
lead to upslope snow showers throughout the High Plains between
today and Saturday morning, with a few inches of accumulating snow
possible. The aforementioned cold front is forecast to reach South
Texas by Saturday morning and the Eastern Seaboard by Saturday
night. As it does so, a weak area of low pressure is expected to
form off the North Carolina coastline and may lead to an area of
light snow across parts of the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday morning.

This cold front will also be responsible for crashing temperatures
and a return to more winter-like conditions throughout the eastern
half of the Nation. Ahead of the cold front, highs are expected to
surge well above average today, with 60s as far north as the
Mid-Atlantic and Tennessee Valley. Temperatures are also expected
to feel quite pleasant on Saturday morning along the East Coast
before temperatures quickly drop behind the cold front. For the
Midwest and Great Lakes, well below average temperatures will
engulf the region this weekend as highs struggle to reach out of
the teens.

Meanwhile, abnormally warm weather is forecast to continue across
California over the next couple of days as a persistent ridge of
high pressure remains parked over the Golden State. Temperatures
into the 70s and 80s through Saturday will have the potential to
break several daily record highs from San Diego, CA to Medford,
OR. The warmest temperatures are anticipated over parts of
Southern California, where highs could reach into the low 90s and
Heat Advisories remain in effect.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CST Fri Feb 11 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will increase for portions of coastal
southern California Saturday amid strengthening offshore winds.
Elsewhere, low-end fire weather conditions are likely across parts
of southern Texas and the northern High Plains, but the fire weather
threat will be dependent on fuel conditions.

...Southern California...
Short and medium range ensemble guidance is in relatively good
agreement in the strengthening of the regional pressure gradient
across southern CA late Friday into Saturday. Increasing
northeasterly mid-level winds will support wind gusts between 30-50
mph within the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties
and possibly southward into the San Diego area. Persistent offshore
flow over the next 48 hours will maintain reduced RH in the teens
and temperatures are forecast to remain near record highs through
the weekend, so elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
appear likely. Fire weather concerns will be maximized in areas that
have seen persistent downslope winds and drier fine fuels.

...Southern Texas...
The cold front that is forecast to push through OK and north TX
Friday will progress through south TX on Saturday. Strong cold
advection behind the front will support wind gusts between 20-40
mph, and modest boundary-layer mixing will help RH fall into the
20-35% range. Confidence in the RH forecast is low due to notable
spread in guidance and low ensemble probabilities, though the best
potential for sustained elevated conditions will most likely be
along and west of I-35 south of San Antonio. Fuel conditions across
southern TX are modestly receptive per latest fuel guidance. ERCs
are currently only slightly above seasonal average and are forecast
to increase to the in the 50-80th percentiles over the weekend. An
Elevated risk area may be needed in subsequent outlooks if fuels
continue to dry and confidence in low RH increases.

...Northern High Plains...
A surface low is expected to deepen over the northern Plains through
the day Saturday as an upper-level wave moves over the region.
Northwest downslope winds off the northern Rockies will support
warming/drying across the northern High Plains from MT into eastern
WY. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph and RH reductions into the
20-30% range are likely. This fire weather concern will be
conditional on fuel status by Saturday. ERCs are generally in the
50-75th percentile and many locations are receiving light snowfall
as of early Friday morning. Trends in fuel status will continue to
be monitored.

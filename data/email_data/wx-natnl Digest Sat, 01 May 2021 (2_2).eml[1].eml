...Heavy rainfall threat across the South for Tuesday/Wednesday...

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

Broad cyclonic flow across the northern tier of the U.S. on
Tuesday is expected to remain in place across the Great Lakes and
the Northeast through the end of the week.  The western Atlantic
ridge near the East Coast will initially result in warm conditions
ahead of the cold front.  Out West, an upper level ridge axis
builds in ahead of the next Pacific storm system as the overall
upper level flow pattern becomes more amplified for the middle to
end of the week.

The deterministic guidance remains in above average agreement on
the synoptic scale features across the nation, especially through
Thursday.  One of the main differences noted was a more amplified
and slower solution with the 12Z CMC across the western U.S. for
the second half of the medium range period, and is an outlier with
the strength of the ridge across the Rockies.  The 00Z CMC was
more in line with the consensus here.  The GFS is considerably
stronger with the potential nor'easter off the East Coast by
Friday, and would be an impactful system if that solution comes to
pass.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic blend through Thursday, and then a GFS/ECMWF
blend along with some of their respective ensemble means for
Friday and Saturday, while depicting a more modest low near the
Northeast for now.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Widespread moderate to heavy rain remains likely across portions
of the Deep South and southern Appalachians during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period.  The region that appears most
favored for excessive rainfall is eastern Louisiana, southern
Mississippi, and into central Alabama.  This region will be in the
warm sector ahead of a slow moving cold front, and some strong
thunderstorms are also likely across this same general area.  This
may be enough to cause some flooding, particularly where
convective training develops or across areas that will have
already received noteworthy prior rains.  Depending on the
evolution and track of the developing low pressure off the East
Coast late in the week, light to moderate rain can be expected
across portions of the Mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast
states.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday.  This will be followed by a return to slightly below
normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold front
with highs in the 50s and 60s, along with increased cloud cover.
Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in response to
the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above normal
possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of the
Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest.  This will equate to
some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

stronger with the potential nor'easter off the East Coast by
Friday, and would be an impactful system if that solution comes to
pass.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
multi-deterministic blend through Thursday, and then a GFS/ECMWF
blend along with some of their respective ensemble means for
Friday and Saturday, while depicting a more modest low near the
Northeast for now.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Widespread moderate to heavy rain remains likely across portions
of the Deep South and southern Appalachians during the
Tuesday-Wednesday time period.  The region that appears most
favored for excessive rainfall is eastern Louisiana, southern
Mississippi, and into central Alabama.  This region will be in the
warm sector ahead of a slow moving cold front, and some strong
thunderstorms are also likely across this same general area.  This
may be enough to cause some flooding, particularly where
convective training develops or across areas that will have
already received noteworthy prior rains.  Depending on the
evolution and track of the developing low pressure off the East
Coast late in the week, light to moderate rain can be expected
across portions of the Mid-Atlantic region and the Northeast
states.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday.  This will be followed by a return to slightly below
normal temperatures to close out the week behind the cold front
with highs in the 50s and 60s, along with increased cloud cover.
Across the western U.S., heat is expected to build in response to
the upper level ridge, with highs 10-20 degrees above normal
possible for the middle to end of the week for portions of the
Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest.  This will equate to
some 100+ degree high temperatures for the lower elevations of
eastern California and southern Arizona.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEVADA...SOUTHWEST
UTAH...AND NORTHWEST ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime punctuated by transient shortwave
troughing across the West is expected to develop through the
forecast period. The upper low over southern Texas will eject
northeastward while upper-level ridging envelops the Southeast. At
the surface, high pressure across the central Appalachians will move
offshore while low pressure develops across the central Rockies and
Plains from a previous low over the Upper Midwest.

...Southern Nevada, Southwest Utah, and Northwest Arizona...
Ahead of a cold front trailing from the central Rockies/Plains area
of low pressure, dry southwesterly winds are expected to develop
through the afternoon hours. Increasing flow aloft from the West
Coast trough should bolster low-level winds to critical criteria
(20-25 mph) through the afternoon. Warm temperatures in the 80s to
90s F will support dry conditions with widespread surface RH below
15%. The resulting overlap will support elevated/critical fire
weather conditions across much of the southern Great Basin and
southwest where fuels are drier than normal.

...Montana and North Dakota...
Northwesterly surface winds, in the wake of a weakening area of low
pressure across the Upper Midwest, will likely remain strong enough
to support a few hours of elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon. Surface RH is forecast to remain in the 25-30% range,
with winds peaking around 15-20 mph. The most likely corridor for
overlap of gusty winds and low humidity is expected across
central/southern North Dakota, with decreasing confidence farther
northwest into eastern Montana. Cooler air to the northwest will
gradually increase humidity recoveries this evening and overnight,
decreasing the fire weather threat after sunset.

...Carolinas...
Offshore flow should gradually weaken through midday as surface high
pressure builds in from the northwest and slowly moves offshore.
Warm temperatures from strong diurnal heating will support humidity
values as low as 15-20% across the Piedmont through the afternoon.
Limited confidence exists concerning the overlap of the lingering
gusty surface winds and low surface humidity, suggesting that the
fire weather threat will be local in nature.

...Central Plains and Upper Midwest...
A developing area of low pressure across the Rockies and High Plains
will interact with a weakening low across northern Minnesota
increasing southerly winds to around 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
Relatively dry surface conditions are expected ahead of a surge of
Gulf moisture being drawn north across the central Plains. A few
hours of dry and windy conditions appear possible into the evening.
The primary limiting factors will be the presence of fuels in green
up, and the arrival of surface moisture later in the
afternoon/evening, which should keep the threat of elevated fire
weather conditions local in nature.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Shortwave troughing across the western US will intensify through the
day as mid-level flow increases near the Four Corners. At the
surface, the central Plains lee low will slide southeastward across
the Texas Panhandle, drawing deep moisture northward across much of
the eastern CONUS. Ahead of a cold front across the southern Great
Basin, dry westerly winds are forecast to develop supporting
elevated/critical fire weather conditions over much of the
Southwest.

...Eastern Arizona and western New Mexico...
As southwesterly flow aloft increases ahead of the shortwave trough
digging in across the Four Corners, surface pressure falls in the
lee of the southern Rockies will drive low-level southwesterlies of
25-35 mph across much of Arizona and New Mexico. Dry air in place
and warm surface temperatures in the 70s and 80s F will support low
surface humidity values of 7-15% across a broad swath of the
Southwest. Elevated and critical fire weather conditions appear
likely across western New Mexico and eastern Arizona, where little
precipitation over the last several days and dry fuels will support
fire spread. To the south and east of this corridor, recent
precipitation will hamper fuel drying to some extent. Pockets of
locally elevated/critical conditions appear possible given the
favorable meteorological conditions expected. However, the
questionable fuel state precludes expansion of the elevated and
critical zones at this time.

...Northern California...
Post frontal northerly flow is expected across much of the
Sacramento Valley through the afternoon Day2/Sunday. Enhanced by
vertical momentum transport from a 50-60 kt mid-level jet on the
backside of the Four Corners trough, low-level winds of 15-25 mph
and higher gusts are expected. With warm temperatures and little
Pacific moisture in place, surface humidity of 15-25% are forecast
to develop through the afternoon. Elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely across the northern half of the Central Valley given
above-average fuel dryness.

...Heavy rain and flash flooding to continue across south-central
and southeast Texas before shifting into the lower Mississippi
Valley along with the threat of severe weather on Sunday...

...Summer-like heat across the northern/central Plains today will
be followed by late-season wet snow over the northern Rockies late
this weekend...

Wet and stormy weather is set to continue across parts of
southeast Texas for the first day of May. A slow moving closed
upper-level low combined with a stalled frontal boundary will
remain the focus for showers and thunderstorms today across the
Lone Star State. As a warm front slowly begins to lift north this
evening, heavy rain is expected to finally start shifting out of
south-central/southeast Texas. Rain will then reach the lower
Mississippi Valley by Sunday morning. Total additional rainfall
amounts are expected to reach up to 4 inches along the
middle/upper Texas Coast, as well as into portions of central
Louisiana. Flash flooding will remain a concern over the next few
days due to downpours occurring over areas that have already seen
over 2 inches of rain over the last 24 hours. WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for today across central and
southeast Texas, as well as tomorrow for central Louisiana. Flash
Flood Watches also remain in effect. A few thunderstorms may turn
severe across the aforementioned regions today, with greater
chances for severe thunderstorms across the lower Mississippi
Valley on Sunday. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk of severe weather for Sunday that includes most of
Mississippi, Louisiana, and far southeast Texas.

Elsewhere in the U.S., an unseasonably cold airmass has settled in
across the eastern third of the country behind a departing cold
front. Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings are in effect from
eastern Kentucky to northwest Pennsylvania this morning.
Temperatures will be quick to rebound to more typical May
standards on Sunday. On the flip side, the northern and central
Plains will experience summer-like heat today ahead of an
approaching cold front. High temperatures are forecast to soar
into the low 90s throughout much of Nebraska. A few new daily high
temperature records could be set as a result. By Sunday, the
approaching frontal boundary will cool things down and produce
scattered showers and thunderstorms from the central High Plains
to the Upper Great Lakes. Rain is likely to changeover to snow
across the Central Rockies Sunday night, where accumulations are
expected to add up to over 6 inches in the highest terrain.

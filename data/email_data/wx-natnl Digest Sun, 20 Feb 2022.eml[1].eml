Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

The ongoing forecast remains on track. See the previous discussion
for details.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Sat Feb 19 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough is forecast to
move across the northern Rockies within strong zonal flow. The
westerly winds crossing the Rockies will enhance surface lee
troughing in the central High Plains, while surface high pressure
over the Ohio Valley will enhance dry return flow across the
southern Plains. Warming temperatures and gusty winds within the dry
air mass will support elevated to near critical fire weather across
parts of the High Plains.

...Central and southern High Plains...
As the lee trough strengthens through the early morning and
afternoon, low-level west-southwesterly flow will increase across
the central High Plains. The dry downslope winds and warming
temperatures will support low relative humidity of 15-25% through
the afternoon. While some snow cover remains (especially across
eastern WY and northern CO), the dry air mass and warming
temperatures should sublimate/melt the lesser snow pack farther
east. Fuels remain very dry and fuel moisture is likely to be only
marginally affected. Thus, widespread elevated fire weather
conditions are likely through the afternoon.

Farther south across the OK/TX Panhandles and northeastern NM, more
southerly low-level flow is expected along the western periphery of
the surface high pressure over the Ohio Valley. A remnant nocturnal
low-level jet will support surface winds of 15-25 mph coincident
with surface RH of 15-20%. Fuels here remain quite dry and support
fire spread. Widespread elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely through much of the day with some localized critical
conditions also possible across the OK/TX Panhandles. Greater
uncertainty exists on the possibility of critical conditions given
the limited model guidance overlap of stronger surface winds and
critical RH.

...Mid Atlantic...
A mid-level shortwave trough and accompanying strong flow aloft will
overspread the Mid-Atlantic, with breezy/gusty westerly surface
winds likely across parts of VA, MD, and NC ahead of a fast moving
arctic cold front. Daytime temperatures in the 40s to 50s, and
downslope flow in the lee of the central Appalachians, may support
minimum RH of 25-35 percent. Confidence is low regarding the
temporal overlap of the breezy surface winds and low RH. Recent
precipitation may also limit fuel availability though some drying is
expected. The cold front will rapidly approach in the afternoon
potentially limiting the window for sustained fire weather
conditions. While no areas will be added, brief locally elevated
conditions may occur within the drier fuels.

...Eastern Nebraska...
Very dry air will likely move into parts of eastern NE and western
IA as the surface high shifts into the mid-Mississippi Valley.
Surface RH may briefly fall below 25% along with gusty low-level
winds. Fuels remain very dry, but much cooler temperatures (upper
30s to low 40s F) will likely keep fire concerns localized.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

Only minor modifications were made to the elevated area. Overnight
RH recovery may be rather slow across parts of the region. With a
strong low-level jet developing in the Texas Panhandle, mechanical
boundary-layer mixing could lead to locally elevated conditions
lasting into the evening.

..Wendt.. 02/19/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sat Feb 19 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow is forecast to become increasingly southwesterly over
the Rockies and Plains Sunday as a Pacific trough begins to deepen
across the western US. Warm southerly flow aided by lee troughing
will overspread the southern High Plains along with low relative
humidity. Dry conditions, gusty winds and ongoing drought will
support critical fire weather potential.

...Southern High Plains...
As the zonal flow over the Rockies gradually becomes more
southwesterly ahead of the developing trough, broad lee troughing
will intensify Sunday with a surface cyclone emerging across
southeastern CO by midday. Low-level winds should increase
accordingly with the stronger pressure gradients driving
west-southwesterly downslope flow across the southern High Plains.
Surface winds of 20-30 mph are expected through the afternoon. The
strong winds will coincide with a low-level thermal ridge supporting
surface RH values of 10-20% from eastern NM, through the TX
Panhandle, and into portions of western OK. Fuels remain very dry
across much of the southern High Plains due to ongoing drought. This
will favor widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions
across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valley to the Mid-Atlantic Tuesday-Friday...

...Heavy snow/ice threats from the Upper Midwest to Maine Tuesday
and southern Plains to Northeast Wednesday-Saturday...


...Pattern Overview...

A very active weather pattern is expected to develop by early next
week over our fine nation as an upper-level trough digs across the
Western U.S. with ejecting energies and induced frontal waves
progressing downstream. The upper trough should shift eastward
into the Central Plains and Midwest by later next week as
amplified ridging builds over the East Pacific and West Coast.
This amplified pattern results in a renewed heavy rain and
flooding threat from roughly the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic through most of next week. There is
also a double dose of winter storm potential with a leading swath
from the Upper Midwest to Maine Tuesday, then broadly from the
Southern Plains to the Northeast Wednesday into Saturday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue an ongoing recent trend
to offer quite similar mid-larger scale flow evolutions in a
medium range pattern with average predictability. A composite of
generally well clustered guidance from the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the National Blend of Models
(NBM) seemingly provides a good forecast basis for days 3-5
(Tuesday-Thursday). This solution is well supported by GEFS/ECMWF
ensembles. The last few GFS runs were slower than the rest with
the other guidance, therefore it was utilized less in our product
blend. The WPC product suite was then mainly derived from the
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and NBM into days 6/7 in a period with
gradulaly growing model forecast spread. This broad strategy tends
to mitigate lingering smaller scale system variances while
maintaining good WPC product continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely to focus early-mid
next week across the cooling West/Rockies as potent upper trough
energies, enhanced by post-frontal upslope fetch, dig into the
West. The wavy front on the leading edge of a cold surge set to
dig into the central U.S. early-mid next week will have upper
support to favor a swath of heavy snow from the Upper Midwest to
Maine Tuesday with some ice accumulations possible along the
southern edge. Meanwhile, ample upper energies working downstream
from the West next week will also act to induce waves along a lead
front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This is
expected to fuel a heavy rain and experimental "slight" ERO flood
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic starting early next week along with potential for
periodic re-development and training along the wavy/slowed
trailing front through later next week. A main second wave
evolution may also support the spread of a heavy snow/ice threat
from parts of the southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
and into a cold air dammed northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Wednesday into Saturday. Given lingering detail uncertainties in
the guidance, confidence on exact snow/ice amounts and locations
remains less certain at these longer lead times, but the potential
is there in this favorable pattern.

Arctic high pressure surging southward into the Central U.S.
during the first half of next week will support much below
temperatures from the Northwest into much of the Central U.S. as
far south as Texas. Especially from the northern High Plains to
the Northern/Central Plains, daytime highs and overnight lows
could be 30-40 or even 50 below normal, which could approach to
exceed record low mins and max values. Daytime highs across the
northern part of this region could struggle to get above 0F
Tuesday. This very cold air will spread, but gradually modify
later next week across the Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above
normal pre-frontal temperatures are expected across the
Southeast/East early in the period (with some records possible,
especially overnight mins) with upper level ridging over the
region.

...Winter Storm to bring heavy mountain snows in the Northwest on
Sunday, spreading into the northern Plains by Monday...

...Near record cold airmass settles into the northern Plains by
Monday...

...Elevated to critical fire weather threat across the southern
and central High Plains...


A cold front dropping into parts of the northern Plains and the
Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes will bring some initial light
snow showers to parts of the region on Sunday. This cold front
will usher in a very cold airmass beginning on Sunday with daytime
highs 20-30 degrees below normal by Monday and record or near
record values possible. This arctic blast will set the stage for a
winter storm to impact the region beginning early Monday.

A storm system diving into the Northwest U.S. will bring periods
of heavy mountain snows to the Cascades and the northern/central
Rockies on Sunday and Monday, with rain along the coast and in the
valleys. The main upper level energy should then spill eastward,
inducing an area of surface low pressure along the above mentioned
cold front. To the north, heavy snow will begin spreading into the
northern Plains overnight Sunday-Monday and into the Upper
Mississippi Valley on Monday. Snowfall accumulations in excess of
6 inches are likely from northern South Dakota into central
Minnesota through Monday evening (but will continue into the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes beyond the short range period as well). Gusty
winds across the northern tier may also create blowing and
drifting snow, making travel difficult at times. Winter storm
watches and advisories are already in place across parts of this
region. To the south, as the upper trough axis shifts across the
Western U.S. on Monday, it should begin tapping return flow
moisture out of the Gulf of Mexico with rain and thunderstorms
increasing in coverage on Monday across the central Gulf Coast
states.

South of the cold front, temperatures from the central/southern
Plains into the East will be above to much above normal Sunday and
Monday. The greatest anomalies near 20 degrees above normal will
equate to daytime highs near or exceeding 80 degrees in some
locations across Texas and Oklahoma. These warm temperatures,
combined with gusty winds and dry conditions, will create elevated
to critical fire weather concerns Sunday and Monday, especially
across the central/southern High Plains.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 19 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic along with a
heavy snow/ice threat from the southern Plains to the Northeast
Wednesday-Friday...


...Pattern Overview...

Expect an active mid-winter pattern this week as cold Canadian
high pressure digs across much of the lower 48 states. Upper level
troughs will dig through the West, with ejecting energies and
induced frontal waves progressing downstream then overtop a
warming Southeast/East upper ridge. The main upper trough should
shift eastward into the Central Plains and Midwest by later week
as amplified ridging builds from the East Pacific into the West
Coast. This amplified pattern favors a heavy to excessive rainfall
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic along with a heavy snow and ice threat from the
southern Plains to the Northeast Wednesday into Friday on the
cooled northern periphery of the expanding precipitation shield
with the tapping of deeper moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and
eventually to a lesser extent from the western Atlantic.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles offer similar mid-larger scale flow
evolutions in a pattern with above normal overall predictability.
A composite of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM) seems to
provide a good forecast basis for days 3-5 (Wednesday-Friday).
Composite blending of these decently clustered models tends to
mitigate smaller scale system variances consistent with
predictability. This solution is supported by a composite of 00
UTC guidance, GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensembles and maintains good WPC
product continuity. The WPC product suite into days 6/7 (next
weekend) was mainly derived from the 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean
that more consistently maintains the likely slow to de-amplfy
upper flow pattern.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely midweek for the
south-central Great Basin/Rockies with approach/passage of potent
upper trough energy and as enhanced by upslope fetch. Ample upper
energies working downstream from the West will also act to induce
waves along a lead front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico. This is expected to fuel a heavy to excessive rainfall
and convection threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
to the Mid-Atlantic, mainly Wednesday/Thursday. Wave organization
and redevelopment should also support the spread of a potentially
significant heavy snow/ice threat from parts of the southern
plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to a cold air dammed
northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Wednesday-Friday.

The cold high pressure surge will spread much below temperatures
across much of the western and central U.S. by mid-late week to
include widespread record cold values, especially frigid from the
northern High Plains to the Northern/Central Plains where daytime
highs and overnight lows could be 30-40+ degrees below normal.
This very cold air will spread, but gradually modify later week
across the Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above normal pre-frontal
temperatures are expected across the Southeast/East with some
record warmth likely, especially overnight mins with upper level
ridging and enhanced pre-frontal moisture into the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow aloft should increase today as the Pacific trough
across the western CONUS becomes more amplified. Warm southerly flow
aided by lee troughing will overspread the southern High Plains
along with low relative humidity. Dry conditions, gusty downslope
winds and ongoing drought will favor critical fire weather potential
across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains...
Lee troughing and surface cyclogenesis are forecast to intensify
today ahead of a broad western US trough. Tightening surface
pressure gradients and greater flow aloft will drive
west-southwesterly downslope flow across much of western TX and
eastern NM. Surface winds of 20-30 mph are expected through the
afternoon along with dry and warm surface conditions. A low-level
thermal ridge will support surface RH values of 10-20% from eastern
NM, through the TX Panhandle, and into portions of western OK. Fuels
remain very dry across much of the southern High Plains due to
ongoing drought. This will favor widespread elevated and critical
fire weather conditions.

...Central High Plains...
Westerly downslope flow is forecast to increase trough the afternoon
in response to stronger flow aloft and the developing lee cyclone
across southern CO. The dry downslope winds may support a brief fire
weather risk with surface RH of 20-30% possible for a few hours near
peak heating. The lack of greater temporal coverage suggests the
threat will remain limited, though local fuels remain very dry.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
As the western US trough continues to deepen Monday, strong
southwesterly flow will overspread the Rockies and adjacent Plains.
A deepening lee cyclone/surface trough will favor dry downslope
winds ahead of an arctic front moving quickly south. With dry fuels
in place, widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected
ahead of the front.

...Southern Plains into southern New Mexico...
The strong flow aloft across the Rockies and deepening lee cyclone
will keep downslope flow likely through much of the day Monday.
Model soundings show dry and well-mixed profiles likely supporting
gusts of 35+ mph across much of the southern High Plains. Several
days of warm and dry surface conditions, along with the downslope
flow, will support widespread relative humidity of 8-15% through the
afternoon. Given the very dry fuels and ongoing drought, critical
fire weather conditions are likely.

Across the Hill Country of south-central TX, greater uncertainty
exists regarding the overall fire weather threat with low model
confidence on the position of the surface dryline. Low-level
moisture advection will intensify through much of the day, gradually
moistening the airmass ahead of the lee low. The uncertainty in
surface RH casts some doubt on eastward extent of elevated fire
weather conditions through central TX.

Isentropic ascent from the warm advection ahead of the approaching
trough may also support a few high-based showers across the Trans
Pecos region later in the forecast period. While these factors may
mitigate the fire risk somewhat, very dry fuels and the potential
for strong wind gusts suggest at least elevated fire weather
conditions are possible.

...Significant winter storm impacting areas of the Plains into the
Great Lakes on Monday into Tuesday...

...Heavy snow for the Cascades Sunday into Tuesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Northern Tier States by Monday morning; In contrast, temperatures
will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over Central/Southern High
Plains...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on
Monday into Tuesday morning...

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes across the Northern
Plains then northwestward across the Northern High Plains into
Western Canada will move eastward to Northern New England and
southward to the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes by Monday
evening/Tuesday morning. The system will produce light snow along
the U. S./Canadian border from the Northern Rockies to the Upper
Great Lakes and some windy conditions on Sunday into Sunday
afternoon. Therefore, blizzard warnings are up over Northeastern
North Dakota and Northwestern Minnesota through 6 PM local time.
By Sunday evening, the snow will end over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Upper Great Lakes. In the meantime, weak
onshore flow and upper-level energy will produce coastal rain and
higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest. The snow will be
a multiple-day heavy snow event for the Cascades.

Incidental, temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average
over Central/Southern High Plains. These warm temperatures,
combined with gusty wind and dry conditions, will create elevated
to critical fire weather concerns Sunday and Monday, especially
across the Central/Southern High Plains.

Moreover, very cold high pressure over West-Central Canada will
bring Temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Northern Tier States by Monday into Tuesday morning, with several
locations having record-breaking or tied low temperatures. The
upper-level energy and record-breaking cold will produce a
significant winter storm impacting areas of the Plains into the
Great Lakes starting Sunday. A mixture of snow, sleet, and
freezing rain may create hazardous travel conditions. Snow will
expand across the Plains and Upper Midwest Monday, becoming heavy
at times. Increasing wind may create blowing and drifting snow,
making travel difficult. Total snowfall amounts may exceed six
inches from Northern South Dakota eastward. By Tuesday, an area of
sleet and rain/freezing rain will lift into the Great Lakes
region, with significant ice accumulations possible. Very cold air
will follow in the system's wake, with temperatures near record
low values Tuesday for the Plains.

Meanwhile, as the cold front moves southward over the
Central/Southern Plains and the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley,
moisture will pool along the boundary aiding in the development of
showers and thunderstorms; some thunderstorms will be severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on Monday into Tuesday morning.

The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. In addition, there is a Marginal Risk for excessive
rainfall associated with these thunderstorms just to the north of
the Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms. Shower and thunderstorms
will also develop over parts of the Ohio Valley on Monday into
Tuesday morning.

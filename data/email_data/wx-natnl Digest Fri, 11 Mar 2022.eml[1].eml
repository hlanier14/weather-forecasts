119 PM EST Thu Mar 10 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 13 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022

...Overview...
Two main waves affect the CONUS next week. The first wave will
dive southeast from the northern Rockies to the Gulf Coast Sunday
night through Tuesday before shifting across the Southeast into or
through the middle of next week. The second, stronger wave, will
bring a quick atmospheric river to the Pacific Northwest before
slowly making its way across The West through Thursday Wednesday
into Thursday. In between, upper ridging will shift from the
western through the central U.S..

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Excellent agreement among the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and the 06Z GFS (and
now the 12Z GFS) on the low that opens into a wave over the
Pacific Northwest Sunday before shifting southeast down the
Rockies through Monday before turning east over the Deep South
Tuesday (which is a slower solution than prior model consensus).
The 00Z CMC, however, was more open with the wave to begin, making
for a more progressive/positively-tilted trough over The West that
lays over the northern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday. Therefore, a blend
of three deterministic models were used for the WPC forecast Days
3-5. Uncertainty with amplitude and timing of the next wave into
the Northwest Monday night as well as the track of the low over
the Southeast starting Tuesday night does warrant incorporation of
the more agreeable 00Z ECENS and 06Z GEFS ensemble means for Days
6/7. Out west, the 00Z ECMWF was much more amplified with the
trough, bringing it into central CA on Tuesday while the 06Z GFS
(and now the 12Z GFS) features two waves that reach the Pacific
Northwest Monday night and Wednesday night. In the Southeast, the
06Z GFS takes a much more northerly track (with the 12Z GFS now
more northerly and faster), moving into the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday
while the 00Z ECWMF maintains an easterly track over the Deep
South before turning up the Carolina Coast Thursday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The Arctic airmass behind a departing powerful low moving from New
England Saturday night will linger into Monday over the Southeast
with Monday morning lows generally 10 to 15 degrees below normal
over the Deep South with min temps around freezing over interior
portions of the Southeast, but not as cold as Sunday morning which
will feature a hard freeze over much of the Southeast into north
Florida. After Monday morning, temperatures in the Central and
East will rebound to more spring like weather with above normal
temperatures persisting through much of next week.

Meanwhile, mountain snows weaken as they cross the
central/southern Rockies Sunday night ahead of the first wave.
However, as this wave encounters strengthening southern stream
energy, amplification occurs over the southern Plains Monday night
and with the addition of Gulf moisture, rapidly increasing rain
and thunderstorms can be expected across the lower MS Valley
Monday night and across the Deep South Tuesday through Wednesday.
Uncertainty exists with the track later Wednesday through
Thursday. There was fair agreement with the 06Z GEFS mean and the
00Z ECMWF which were used to enhance rainfall over the southeast
through Thursday. Out West, the second trough will direct an
atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest Sunday night,
bringing mostly beneficial rainfall and higher elevation snows to
western Washington/Oregon before spreading south through northern
California through Monday night. Upper level ridging between these
troughs will build across the central U.S. with daytime highs 15
to 25 degrees above normal by next Tuesday-Wednesday for the
northern/central Plains/Midwest before spreading into the
northeast Thursday, which should be a welcome relief to the wintry
weather currently over these areas.

...Overview...
Two main waves affect the CONUS next week. The first wave will
dive southeast from the northern Rockies to the Gulf Coast Sunday
night through Tuesday before shifting across the Southeast into or
through the middle of next week. The second, stronger wave, will
bring a quick atmospheric river to the Pacific Northwest before
slowly making its way across The West through Thursday Wednesday
into Thursday. In between, upper ridging will shift from the
western through the central U.S..

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Excellent agreement among the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and the 06Z GFS (and
now the 12Z GFS) on the low that opens into a wave over the
Pacific Northwest Sunday before shifting southeast down the
Rockies through Monday before turning east over the Deep South
Tuesday (which is a slower solution than prior model consensus).
The 00Z CMC, however, was more open with the wave to begin, making
for a more progressive/positively-tilted trough over The West that
lays over the northern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday. Therefore, a blend
of three deterministic models were used for the WPC forecast Days
3-5. Uncertainty with amplitude and timing of the next wave into
the Northwest Monday night as well as the track of the low over
the Southeast starting Tuesday night does warrant incorporation of
the more agreeable 00Z ECENS and 06Z GEFS ensemble means for Days
6/7. Out west, the 00Z ECMWF was much more amplified with the
trough, bringing it into central CA on Tuesday while the 06Z GFS

Northwest Monday night and Wednesday night. In the Southeast, the
06Z GFS takes a much more northerly track (with the 12Z GFS now
more northerly and faster), moving into the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday
while the 00Z ECWMF maintains an easterly track over the Deep
South before turning up the Carolina Coast Thursday.

SYNOPSIS: The jet stream pattern is forecast to become more progressive dur=
ing
week-2. Surface low pressure is anticipated to form over the Northeast
Pacific,
supporting enhanced moisture flow to coastal parts of the northwestern
contiguous U.S. (CONUS), bringing heavy precipitation to some of these area=
s
at
the beginning of the period. A series of surface lows are predicted to form
across the central CONUS, increasing chances for episodes of high winds acr=
oss
parts of the Great Plains and possible heavy snow to portions of the Northe=
rn
Rockies at the middle of the period. Over Alaska, amplified centered over t=
he
central Mainland supports increased chances of extreme cold over the southe=
rn
Mainland during the first few days of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest
and
northwestern California, Fri-Sat, Mar 18-19.

Slight risks of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades, Fri-S=
at,
Mar 18-19.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Northern Rockies, Sun-Tue, Mar 2=

VZfPG0SHM_s$

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 18 - THURSDAY MARCH 24: Today's GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble forecasts are in relatively good agreement indicating surface low
pressure intensifying over the Central and Southern Plains before rapidly
moving eastward, followed by a transition to a more zonal pattern aloft acr=
oss
the CONUS toward the end of week-2.



Predicted surface low formation over the North Pacific is anticipated to br=
ing
enhanced moisture flow to the northwestern CONUS at the beginning of the
period. The GEFS and ECMWF ensembles indicate increased integrated vapor
transport values (IVT) over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California from the beginning to middle of the period, although the signal =
is
slightly weakened compared to yesterday. This pattern supports a slight ris=
k
of
heavy precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest and northweste=
rn
California, Mar 18 to 19. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools also continue=
 to
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulated precipitation exceeding
the
85th percentile of the climatological distribution and 1 inch over the regi=
on.
The slight risks of heavy snow are maintained in today's outlook over parts=
 of
the higher elevation areas of the Cascades, Mar 18 to 19 where the
experimental
GEFS snow water equivalent (SWE) reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chanc=
e
of
3-day SWE exceeding the 85th (67th) percentile across the northern (souther=
n)
Cascades.



A surface low is predicted to develop over the Northern Plains toward the
middle of the period. This feature combined with enhanced moist flow from t=
he
Pacific supports a slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Northern
Rockies, Mar 20 to 22. The experimental GEFS SWE reforecast tool shows at
least
a 20% chance of SWE exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch (one inc=
h
locally) across the highlighted risk area. This risk is also supported by t=
he
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble, which shows a signal of enhanced snowfall acro=
ss
this region.



A series of surface lows are anticipated to form over the central CONUS dur=
ing
week-2. An initial surface low at the beginning of the period is anticipate=
d
to
be further south than yesterday's model guidance. The slight risk of high
winds
is extended across a broader area and further in time for episodes of this
risk, Mar 18 to 22. The GEFS reforecast tool limits the high wind signal to
the
Northern Plains at the beginning of the period, whereas the ECMWF reforecas=
t
tool indicates a broader area extending through the middle of the period. T=
he
ECMWF reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding =
the
85th percentile and 25 mph across the Central and Southern Plains days 10 t=
o
12
(Mar 20 to 22). Anticipated high winds combined with dry fuels may support
enhanced risk of wildfires over the Central and Southern Plains. There are
currently multiple large incidents of wildfire across the Southern Plains.



For Alaska, strong northeasterly surface flow over much of the southern
Mainland associated with strong surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alask=
a
and surface high pressure sinking southward into the Mainland from the Nort=
h
supports the potential for extreme cold across parts of the Mainland. A sli=
ght
risk of much below normal temperatures is posted across south-central and
southwestern Alaska, Mar 18 to 20, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
indicate a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile
during the first few days of the period. Many locations in the highlighted
risk
area could experience minimum temperatures on the order of 14 Deg F below
normal.

...Moderate to heavy snow continues over portions of the Southern
Rockies and Central/Southern Plains before spreading south and
east...

...Frigid temperatures return to much of the Central US as an
Arctic airmass descends over the Great Plains and Mississippi
Valley...

...Threats of severe weather and heavy rain will persist over the
Southeast through the first half of the weekend...

...A significant winter storm is increasingly likely to impact
portions of the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and interior Eastern US
late Friday through Saturday...

An active weather pattern is expected to continue for the eastern
two-thirds of the CONUS largely due to a pair of slow moving
frontal boundaries. The first, which extends from the Northeast,
through the Great Plains and Southwest, will be responsible for a
swath of appreciable snowfall extending from the Southern Rockies
through the interior Eastern US over the coming days. Upper level
shortwave energy, an abundance of atmospheric moisture, and
large-scale forcing for ascent will fuel moderate to heavy
snowfall from the Southern Rockies to the Central plains along and
behind the front. Much of the heavy snow, with accumulations of 6
to 8+ inches, is forecast to fall over higher terrain along the
Colorado/New Mexico border including the San Juan and Sangre de
Cristo mountains. Lesser totals of 2 to 4 inches are expected
further east over the Central/Southern Plains, though isolated
higher amounts will be possible near the Kansas/Missouri border.
As the frontal boundary progresses south and east on Friday the
snowfall area will follow suit, producing light to moderate
accumulations from eastern New Mexico to the western Ohio Valley.
To account for the aforementioned snowfall, Winter Weather
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect from the
Southern Rockies through the western Ohio Valley. Behind the
frontal boundary surface high pressure is forecast to descend and
build over the Great Plains and Upper Midwest, carrying with it a
frigid Arctic airmass that is expected to drop daily high and low
temperatures as much as 20 to 30 degrees below normal for much of
the Central US/Midwest Friday and Saturday. For areas out of reach
of the invading oppressive cold, temperatures are forecast to
remain at or near normal into the weekend.

The second of the two high-impact frontal boundaries can be found
over the Southeast and is forecast to remain there into the
weekend. Instability along the front will allow for moderate to
heavy showers and thunderstorms with rain rates potentially
reaching 1.5 inches per hour to develop over southeast Georgia and
northern Florida. These high rain rates over already moist soils
has prompted the Weather Prediction Center to issue a Marginal
Risk of for Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Southeast
through Friday morning. A marked increase in atmospheric moisture
and instability over the Southeast on Friday is expected to fuel
higher rain rates and associated rainfall totals over the region.
With 24 hour rainfall accumulations expected to fall somewhere
between 2 to 4 inches over increasingly moist soils, thereby
heightening the risk of flash flooding, the Weather Prediction
Center has hoisted a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall over
portions of northern Florida and southern Georgia effective Friday
morning into Saturday morning. Environmental conditions conducive
for the development of severe thunderstorms are expected to
accompany the heavy rainfall over the Southeast into the weekend.
Given the potential for damaging wind gusts, isolated hail, and a
tornado or two to develop within these thunderstorms, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms
for portions of central Florida through the evening hours. By
Friday the severe weather threat is forecast to encompass a much
wider and substantially more atmospherically unstable area from
the central Gulf Coast states to North Carolina. Thunderstorms
that develop over these areas have the potential to produce
damaging wind gusts, isolated hail, and a few tornadoes. Portions
of northern Florida and southern Georgia have the highest
probability for these hazards to occur, prompting the Storm
Prediction Center to issue an Enhanced Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms over these areas effective Friday morning into
Saturday morning.

Overnight Friday and into Saturday morning an upper-level
shortwave trough is expected to amplify, subsequently forcing the
two frontal boundaries to merge into a very strong low
pressure/frontal system over the Eastern US. Strong cold air
advection on the backside of this system will result in any
precipitation from the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys through the
interior Eastern US to fall as snow, with snow rates potentially
reaching 1 to 2 inches per hour in some areas. These heavy snows,
in combination with gusty winds, could severely reduce visibility
and create difficult to hazardous travel conditions. While 4 to 6
inch snowfall accumulations are generally expected over the
affected portions of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, much higher
totals that are likely to exceed 12 inches are forecast for the
interior Northeast. Ahead of this impactful winter storm, Winter
Storm Watches have been raised from the northern Tennessee Valley
through the interior Northeast.

Elsewhere, gusty winds associated with a low pressure wave are
expected pass over moderately dry fuels in the Southwest. With
ambient relative humidity values forecast to remain low through
the mid to late afternoon hours, the Storm Prediction Center has
highlighted an Elevated Fire Weather threat area from far
southeast Arizona to far western Texas. Red Flag warnings are
currently in effect for portions of southeastern Arizona and
southwestern New Mexico. Over the Desert Southwest, a tight
pressure gradient will lead to the development of high winds today
and Friday that could gust up to 55 miles per hour, prompting the
issuance of Wind Advisories throughout the region. Furthermore,
these winds could kick up and blow around dust, reducing
visibility and making driving hazardous. As such, Blowing Dust
Advisories have been raised for areas along the California/Arizona
border.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu March 10 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 16 - 20 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting a 500-hPa flow
pattern consistent with the positive phases of the AO and the NAO. Broad
troughing is forecast across the Davis Strait and southern Greenland while
anomalous ridging is predicted to the south across most of the western and
central mid-latitude North Atlantic. Above normal heights associated with t=
he
ridging over the Atlantic are forecast to overspread most of the eastern
CONUS.
Low amplitude flow and accompanying above normal heights are predicted acro=
ss
most of the remainder of the CONUS. An enhanced height gradient typical of =
a
positive AO is expected across much of the northern CONUS, due to the contr=
ast
between predicted below normal heights at high latitudes of the Northern
Hemisphere and above normal heights across the mid-latitudes of North Ameri=
ca.
This elevated height gradient is likely to promote enhanced Pacific flow,
particularly across the northwestern CONUS and the Alaska Panhandle. An
amplified pattern is forecast across most of the remainder of Alaska as a
strong ridge forecast to the west of the state is likely to promote deep
troughing downstream across the Mainland.

As above normal heights are predicted to overspread the eastern CONUS
associated with ridging in the western Atlantic, above normal temperatures =
are
likely from the Eastern Seaboard westward to the Plains. Probabilities of
above
normal temperatures exceed 70 percent for parts of the Mid-Atlantic States,
Ohio Valley, and southern Great Lakes, where heights are forecast to be abo=
ve
normal for most of the valid period. Broad, low amplitude flow and above
normal
heights lead to increased odds of above normal temperatures for the
southwestern CONUS. Below normal temperatures are likely for most of Alaska=
,
associated with predicted deep troughing across the Mainland.

An active pattern is favored for southeastern Alaska and the northwestern
CONUS
due to the likelihood of enhanced Pacific Flow across these regions.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent for parts of =
the
southern Alaska Panhandle and Pacific Northwest. Enhanced odds of above nor=
mal
precipitation extend to the south and east, to the Central Rockies and High
Plains, as shortwave energy associated with a frontal boundary traverses th=
e
region during the period. Below normal precipitation is favored well to the
south of the mean storm track, across most of the southwestern eastward to =
the
Rio Grande Valley. Enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation are
also indicated for the Northern Plains, due to predicted surface high press=
ure
and the potential for downslope flow. Above normal precipitation is favored
for
much of the East, due to the potential for return flow of moisture near the
periphery of the ridge predicted over the western North Atlantic.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on a positive AO/NAO pattern early in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 18 - 24 2022

During week-2, the positive NAO/AO signal is forecast to significantly weak=
en,
as 500-hPa heights return to near normal across much of the higher latitude=
s
of
the Northern Hemisphere. However, ridging is forecast to persist access the
western North Atlantic, resulting in a continuation of above normal heights
across the Eastern Seaboard. Enhanced zonal flow is forecast across most of
the
western and central CONUS. Elevated north to south height gradients are
predicted to be particularly strong for the northwestern CONUS, promoting
increased Pacific flow across the region. Farther to the north and west, a
high
amplitude flow pattern is forecast to continue across Alaska. A strong ridg=
e
is
expected over the Bering Sea and deep downstream troughing is forecast to
progress slightly eastward, toward the central and eastern Mainland.

Ridging is forecast to persist over the western North Atlantic throughout m=
ost
of week-2, resulting in increased confidence in above normal temperatures f=
or
most of the Eastern Seaboard. Predicted zonal flow and near to above normal
heights lead to increased chances of near to above normal temperatures acro=
ss
the central and southwestern CONUS. Below normal temperatures are slightly
favored for parts of the northwestern CONUS, as a trough progresses through
the
region toward the middle of the period. Below normal temperatures are most
likely for Alaska as persistent troughing is forecast across most of the
state.

With enhanced Pacific Flow expected, increased odds of above normal
precipitation are indicated for the northwestern CONUS. Teleconnections fro=
m
the main anomaly features in the predicted mean 500-hPa flow pattern also
generally support a southward expansion of elevated above normal precipitat=
ion
chances into Northern California. Below normal precipitation is most likely
for
much of the southwestern and CONUS and for parts of the Southern and Centra=
l
Plains, well to the south of the predicted mean storm track. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONUS, due to the potentia=
l
for return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high
pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Below normal precipitation is likely f=
or
most of Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutians, downstrea=
m
of
a ridge predicted over the Bering Sea.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted significant weakening of the AO/NAO signal during the period.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

334 PM EST Thu Mar 10 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 13 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022

...Overview...
Two main waves affect the CONUS next week. The first wave will
dive southeast from the northern Rockies to the Gulf Coast Sunday
night through Tuesday before shifting across the Southeast into or
through the middle of next week. The second, stronger wave, will
bring a quick atmospheric river to the Pacific Northwest before
slowly making its way across The West through Thursday Wednesday
into Thursday. In between, upper ridging will shift from the
western through the central U.S..

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Excellent agreement among the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET and the 06Z GFS (and
now the 12Z GFS) on the low that opens into a wave over the
Pacific Northwest Sunday before shifting southeast down the
Rockies through Monday before turning east over the Deep South
Tuesday (which is a slower solution than prior model consensus).
The 00Z CMC, however, was more open with the wave to begin, making
for a more progressive/positively-tilted trough over The West that
lays over the northern Gulf of Mexico Tuesday. Therefore, a blend
of three deterministic models were used for the WPC forecast Days
3-5. Uncertainty with amplitude and timing of the next wave into
the Northwest Monday night as well as the track of the low over
the Southeast starting Tuesday night does warrant incorporation of
the more agreeable 00Z ECENS and 06Z GEFS ensemble means for Days
6/7. Out west, the 00Z ECMWF was much more amplified with the
trough, bringing it into central CA on Tuesday while the 06Z GFS
(and now the 12Z GFS) features two waves that reach the Pacific
Northwest Monday night and Wednesday night. In the Southeast, the
06Z GFS takes a much more northerly track (with the 12Z GFS now
more northerly and faster), moving into the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday
while the 00Z ECWMF maintains an easterly track over the Deep
South before turning up the Carolina Coast Thursday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The Arctic airmass behind a departing powerful low moving from New
England Saturday night will linger into Monday over the Southeast
with Monday morning lows generally 10 to 15 degrees below normal
over the Deep South with min temps around freezing over interior
portions of the Southeast, but not as cold as Sunday morning which
will feature a hard freeze over much of the Southeast into north
Florida. After Monday morning, temperatures in the Central and
East will rebound to more spring like weather with above normal
temperatures persisting through much of next week.

Meanwhile, mountain snows weaken as they cross the
central/southern Rockies Sunday night ahead of the first wave.
However, as this wave encounters strengthening southern stream
energy, amplification occurs over the southern Plains Monday night
and with the addition of Gulf moisture, rapidly increasing rain
and thunderstorms can be expected across the lower MS Valley
Monday night and across the Deep South Tuesday through Wednesday.
Uncertainty exists with the track later Wednesday through
Thursday. There was fair agreement with the 06Z GEFS mean and the
00Z ECMWF which were used to enhance rainfall over the southeast
through Thursday. Out West, the second trough will direct an
atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest Sunday night,
bringing mostly beneficial rainfall and higher elevation snows to
western Washington/Oregon before spreading south through northern
California through Monday night. Upper level ridging between these
troughs will build across the central U.S. with daytime highs 15
to 25 degrees above normal by next Tuesday-Wednesday for the
northern/central Plains/Midwest before spreading into the
northeast Thursday, which should be a welcome relief to the wintry
weather currently over these areas.

128 AM EST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 14 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 18 2022

...Overview...
In a progressive flow pattern, a couple notable weather systems
will move through the Lower 48 next week. The firs system dives
southeast through the northern Rockies toward the Gulf Coast and
Southeast through the middle of next week while a compact and
moderately strong atmospheric river impacts the Pacific Northwest.
Temperatures will trend above normal for much of the central to
eastern U.S. mid to late week, offering spring-like temperatures
reaching 10-20 above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
In general, the synoptic pattern for the CONUS offered very good
agreement in the main surface features and evolution in the 500 mb
pattern for next week. Some notable differences were associated
with the closed mid-level low over the Southeast Tues-Wed, where
some north-south waffling between the various deterministic models
continues. The GFS has been a northern and faster solution while
the CMC was a southern outlier. The ECMWF/UKMET offered a good
consensus and was heavily included in the forecast blend along
with the 18Z GFS and 12Z CMC. Toward days 6-7, as the next
shortwave energy emerges into the central U.S., there are some
timing and strength differences where the GFS shows its fast bias
compared to the ECMWF. Given the increasing spread, heavier
weights of the ECENS/GEFS were included to maintain continuity
while adjusting for the latest trends. For the Pacific Northwest,
there was above agreement with the deterministic guidance in the
amplitude and progression of the shortwave trough moving through
Monday-Tuesday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
Much below normal temperatures can be expected Monday morning
across the Southeast where readings well into the 30s are forecast
as far south as northern Florida, which would be 10 to 15 degrees
below normal. The aforementioned low pressure over the Plains then
drops toward the lower MS Valley Monday-Tuesday then the Gulf
Coast/Southeast mid-week. This system may draw up modest amounts
of Gulf moisture ahead of it and could combine with sufficient
instability to bring widespread thunderstorms capable of producing
heavy rainfall, especially along/near the Gulf Coast region. For
the Pacific Northwest, the bulk of the atmospheric river aims on
the region Monday into Tuesday where widespread precipitation of
several inches is possible. This rainfall is expected to be mostly
beneficial but localized flooding issues could develop for some of
the more sensitive locations. With snow levels generally 5000-6000
ft, the higher peaks of the Olympics and Cascades could see
another round of heavy elevation snowfall. A taste of spring-like
temperatures is also generally expected for much of the central to
eastern U.S. next week. Daytime highs reaching 10 to 20 degrees
above normal, especially for portions of the Midwest to Great
Lakes.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1240 AM CST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough will continue to shift east and intensify
today. At the surface, a strong cold front will push south and east
through the Plains and into the lower Mississippi Valley. High
pressure will remain in the Great Basin and build into a large
portion of the country east of the Divide.

Fire weather concerns will be relatively low during the period.
Strong offshore winds are still expected through mid morning in
southern California. Live fuel moisture remains high enough to limit
fire weather concerns. Pockets of dry and windy conditions are also
possible behind the cold front in the Plains and the Southwest.
Between limited spatial coverage and poorly receptive fuels,
concerns will similarly be mitigated in these areas as well.

1242 AM CST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move off of the East Coast on
Saturday. In the West, an upper-level ridge will continue to
progress towards the Plains. A shortwave trough dropping
southeastward out of the Canadian Prairie Provinces will promote a
northern Plains/upper Midwest surface low. Some surface troughing
may extend into the southern High Plains.

Flow in the southern Plains will turn to southerly/southwesterly as
the surface high shifts to the east. With the subtle lee troughing
that is expected, some dry and modestly breezy conditions are
possible. Given possible precipitation along with colder
temperatures on Friday, fine fuels will likely need further drying
before fire weather concerns will increase again.

...A significant winter storm will impact portions of the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys through the interior Eastern US late today
through Saturday...

...Heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms expected to impact the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Frigid temperatures return to much of the Central US this
weekend as an Arctic airmass descends over the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley...

...New Pacific system to bring heavy snowfall to the Cascades and
Northern Rockies beginning late Saturday...

An amplifying upper-level trough will be the driving force behind
an active weather pattern across the eastern seaboard through
Saturday afternoon. A swath of light snow will fall from the
Southern Plains to the Wisconsin today on the backside of a cold
front traversing the central U.S.. This cold front will strengthen
as the upper trough deepens, which will lead to the development of
a significant winter storm across the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys
through the interior Eastern U.S. late today through Saturday.
Snow rates of greater than 1 inch per hour combined with gusty
winds will produce blowing and drifting snow. This will severely
reduce visibility and make for difficult to hazardous driving
conditions. The greatest snow accumulations are likely across
portions of the interior Northeast where totals in excess of 12
inches are likely. Heavy wet snowflakes may cause scattered power
outages. Cold air will spread across the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic in the wake of this storm system with lows likely to
be below freezing along the Gulf Coast and into northern Florida
Sunday morning.

In the South another low pressure system will produce heavy
rainfall and scattered to severe thunderstorms over much of the
coastal Southeast/Mid-Atlantic through Saturday afternoon. This
system will send a warm front north toward the Gulf coast this
morning. This boundary in conjunction with the amplifying upper
trough over the central U.S. will allow for substantial moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico to overspread the coastal front and impact
much of the Southeast. Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms are
likely to focus around the panhandle of Florida late tonight
before expanding into the coastal Mid-Atlantic on Saturday. A
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding is in
effect for the central Florida panhandle into southern Georgia for
tonight. Enhanced Risks of Severe Thunderstorms are in effect for
portions of the central panhandle of Florida and coastal Carolinas
today and Saturday morning respectively. Slight Risks of Severe
Thunderstorms are also in effect for much of the central Gulf
Coast through the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic coast late tonight
through Saturday morning. Damaging winds, isolated hail and a few
tornadoes are possible during this time. Light to moderate rain
and scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread into the
coastal Mid-Atlantic and Northeast late Friday night and
continuing through Saturday.

An Arctic airmass currently stationed over central U.S. will
expand eastward into the Midwest and Deep South on Saturday before
shifting into the East Coast on Sunday. High temperatures for
today are likely to be between 20-30 degrees below average over
much of the Central Plains. Much of North Dakota will struggle to
make it out of the single digits today. A new system will arrive
over the Pacific Northwest on Saturday, leading to the potential
for moderate to heavy rainfall for the coastal and low lying areas
as well as heavy snow for the Cascades and Northern Rockies.

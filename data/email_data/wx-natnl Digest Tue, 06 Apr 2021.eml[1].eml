Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Mon Apr 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTH AND NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA...

An elevated risk area was introduced for portions of the Dakotas.
Mid-morning surface observations show a cold front extending from a
weak surface low over the Red River Valley southwestward into
southwest SD. Behind this front, warming temperatures within a weak
cold advection regime have allowed RH values to fall into the 25-35%
range with winds gusting to 20-30 mph. Elevated fire weather
conditions will remain possible immediately behind the front as it
shifts to the east/southeast through the day. Confidence in
prolonged elevated conditions is highest for central to southwest
SD, with decreasing confidence to the north and northeast due to a
relatively quicker progression of the front (and shorter duration of
dry/windy conditions) and increasing cloud cover with light rain
across northern ND.

Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed. Low-level water vapor imagery shows a pocket of dry air with
a history of subsidence over southern NV that should reach
northern/northeast AZ by the afternoon hours. As such, critical fire
weather conditions remain most likely for this region.

..Moore.. 04/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Mon Apr 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough will dig southeastward into the
central/southern Great Basin. A southern stream mid-level jet will
phase with the trough and bring strong winds aloft across much of
the Basin into the Southwest. At the surface, the trough will bring
a cold front through Nevada to near the Four Corners by the end of
the period. Farther east, a surface low will deepen along the CO/KS
border, particularly overnight. A strong upper-low will remain off
the Northeast coast bringing enhanced low-level winds across parts
of New England into the Mid-Atlantic.

...Southwest/Great Basin...
Strong southwesterly winds are likely as the cold front approaches
during the day. The strengthening pressure gradient will be
augmented by the strong winds aloft. Winds of 20-30 mph are
possible, especially north of the Mogollon Rim. With RH nearing
10-15%, critical fire weather is likely in northeast Arizona.
Long-term drought will limit the abundance of fuels, but those that
are present will be available to burn.

In NV/UT, similarly dry conditions will exist with RH potentially as
low as 10-15% with 15-20% becoming more common with northward
westward extent. Elevated to locally critical conditions will be
possible in these locations. Fuels are slightly less receptive as
compared to AZ so critical highlights will be withheld this outlook.


...Southern/Central High Plains...
Mid-level winds will be weaker this far east, though the deepening
lee cyclone will still promote 15-20 mph wind with higher speeds
possible in terrain-favored areas. Very deep mixing is expected with
potential for 5-20% RH by afternoon. Locally critical conditions may
occur in wind-prone areas, but elevated fire weather is the main
expectation given the weaker surface winds.

...Northeast...
Surface winds of around 15 mph are possible during the afternoon.
Winds could gust into the 20-30 mph range. Mid-level dry air on the
western flank of the upper-low will keep skies clear and allow RH to
fall to 25-35%. Elevated fire weather is expected given dry fine
fuels.

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 13 - MONDAY APRIL 19: There are significant differences

ridging across the West, and a negatively tilted shortwave trough shifting
eastward from the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley early in
week-2.
This latter feature is absent from 0z GEFS, which features weak troughing
extending from the Canadian prairies to the southwestern CONUS with more zo=
nal
mid-level flow downstream across the central and eastern CONUS throughout m=
uch
of the outlook period. With strong positive height departures predicted by
both
models over the higher latitudes of eastern Canada, the overall mean mid-le=
vel
height pattern resembles the negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phas=

which would typically favor below-normal temperatures and above-normal
precipitation across the eastern CONUS. However, given the model difference=

with respect to the evolution of the mid-level pattern, as well as the low
amplitude nature of these mid-level features predicted over the CONUS, ther=

is
reduced confidence for potentially hazardous weather for much of the countr=

today's outlook. The one exception is over the higher latitudes of western
North America, as much of the anomalous troughing and potentially hazardous
cold over Alaska is favored to persist from week-1 into early week-2. Thoug=

a

middle to latter portion of the outlook period.



By the start of week-2, both the GEFS and ECMWF depict surface high pressur=

Increased probabilities for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th

Along the southern tier of the CONUS, lower-level southerly flow is expecte=

0159 PM CDT Mon Apr 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT AREAS OF
TEXT AND SOUTHEAST COLORADO...

A slight westward expansion of the critical risk area was
introduced. Recent ensemble guidance has trended towards higher
probability of sustained 20+ mph winds across central to western NM,
and recent fuel reports suggests fuels are receptive enough to
support the fire weather threat. Otherwise, only minor adjustments
were made, and the forecast outlined in the previous discussion
below remains valid.

..Moore.. 04/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Mon Apr 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A potent upper-level trough will continue east into the southern
High Plains on Tuesday. Mid-level winds will be strong across parts
of the Southwest into western Texas. At the surface, the surface low
in western Kansas will continue to deepen and develop southward and
eastward during the afternoon and evening. A cold front will move
southward along the lee of the Rockies and into the southern High
Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Surface winds across southern New Mexico into the Trans-Pecos and
east-central New Mexico are expected to reach 20-30 mph. Guidance
continues to show that region reaching near 5% RH during the
afternoon with 10-15% from Arizona into the Texas Panhandle. Locally
extremely critical meteorological conditions are possible especially
along the West Texas southern New Mexico border where 850 mb winds
will be stronger. However, ERCs at or just above normal will
generally limit extreme fire behavior.

...Southwest...
Elevated fire weather is again expected during the afternoon with
the deepening low to the east and lingering strong mid-level winds.
RH of 10-20% will be possible eastern Arizona into parts of western
New Mexico. Winds will be weaker with westward extent and are only
expected to reach 15-20 mph. Some locations could see 20+ mph but
duration should be brief.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Mon Apr 05 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 08 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 12 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning keeps the general theme of bringing
relatively progressive upper troughs and embedded shortwaves
through the Northwest to interact with a low pressure system that
is forecast to slow down across the upper Midwest as an omega
block sets up over eastern Canada.  The ensemble means from the
GEFS, ECMWF, and CMC show good agreement on this overall pattern
evolution through the medium-range period although the EC mean
shows a more distinct deepening of an upper trough over the
northern Plains on Day 7.

A broad swath of rainfall with embedded heavy rains will likely
edge eastward into the eastern U.S. on Thursday with good model
agreement on its timing.  The rain will extend northwest across
the Great Lakes and warp around the low pressure system moving
into the upper Midwest.  Some of the rain across the upper Midwest
could change over to a period of light snow as a cold front
arrives from the west.  Meanwhile, models continue to show decent
signal for heavy rainfall to continue across the Deep South to the
Southeast on Thursday.  By late Friday into Saturday, there is
good consensus for another episode of heavy rain to develop over
the lower Mississippi Valley.  Models have generally trended
wetter regarding this episode.

Meanwhile, a good chance of rain will likely to continue into the
weekend across the Mid-Atlantic with a lingering front.

In light of the above considerations, the WPC medium-range
forecast was based on the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS
together with a smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC.  More of
their ensemble means were used for Days 5 - 7 o handle the
uncertainty.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Combination of the initial Midwest upper low/surface system and
upstream energy that replaces it will produce a period of
precipitation of varying intensity over the Midwest/Great Lakes.
Most of this activity will be rain with a slight chance for the
northwestern fringe of the moisture shield to contain a little
snow.  The front approaching from the western U.S. toward the
leading system could provide a focus for enhancement.  A fairly
broad area of rainfall will also extend across many other portions
of the East along/ahead of fronts associated with the northern
systems.  Heaviest rainfall is most likely to be over portions of
the Southeast into Friday.  By late Friday into the weekend,
shortwave energy traversing the southern Plains could support
another episode of heavy rainfall across the Deep South toward the
eastern Gulf Coast.  Over the Northwest/northern Rockies expect an
episode of fairly light rain/mountain snow around Thursday
followed by another event late week into next Monday.  Highest
totals with the latter should be over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

Clouds and precipitation will tend to support above normal morning
lows over the eastern U.S. for most of the period.  Some locations
in the Midwest/Great Lakes may see record warm lows on Thursday,
within an area of plus 15-25F anomalies.  High temperatures will
be more moderate but the Great Lakes and vicinity could still see
daytime readings exceed 10F above normal late this week into
Saturday.  Meanwhile expect a localized area of well above normal
temperatures over southern Texas, especially late this week when
highs could reach at least 15F above normal, with a moderating
trend to follow.  Actual high temperatures on Friday are forecast
to exceed the century mark along the Rio Grande Valley.  The
southern half to two-thirds of the West will generally be above
normal through the period with plus 5-12F anomalies for highs.
Farther north expect a couple periods of modestly below normal
highs behind progressive cold fronts.

Extended Forecast Discussion

341 PM EDT Mon Apr 05 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 08 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 12 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning keeps the general theme of bringing
relatively progressive upper troughs and embedded shortwaves
through the Northwest to interact with a low pressure system that
is forecast to slow down across the upper Midwest as an omega
block sets up over eastern Canada.  The ensemble means from the
GEFS, ECMWF, and CMC show good agreement on this overall pattern
evolution through the medium-range period although the EC mean
shows a more distinct deepening of an upper trough over the
northern Plains on Day 7.

A broad swath of rainfall with embedded heavy rains will likely
edge eastward into the eastern U.S. on Thursday with good model
agreement on its timing.  The rain will extend northwest across
the Great Lakes and warp around the low pressure system moving
into the upper Midwest.  Some of the rain across the upper Midwest
could change over to a period of light snow as a cold front
arrives from the west.  Meanwhile, models continue to show decent
signal for heavy rainfall to continue across the Deep South to the
Southeast on Thursday.  By late Friday into Saturday, there is
good consensus for another episode of heavy rain to develop over
the lower Mississippi Valley.  Models have generally trended
wetter regarding this episode.

Meanwhile, a good chance of rain will likely to continue into the
weekend across the Mid-Atlantic with a lingering front.

In light of the above considerations, the WPC medium-range
forecast package was based on the consensus of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z
GFS together with a smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC.  More
of their ensemble means were used for Days 5 - 7 to handle the
uncertainty.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Combination of the initial Midwest upper low/surface system and
upstream energy that replaces it will produce a period of
precipitation of varying intensity over the Midwest/Great Lakes.
Most of this activity will be rain with a slight chance for the
northwestern fringe of the moisture shield to contain a little
snow.  The front approaching from the western U.S. toward the
leading system could provide a focus for enhancement.  A fairly
broad area of rainfall will also extend across many other portions
of the East along/ahead of fronts associated with the northern
systems.  Heaviest rainfall is most likely to be over portions of
the Southeast into Friday.  By late Friday into the weekend,
shortwave energy traversing the southern Plains could support
another episode of heavy rainfall across the Deep South toward the
eastern Gulf Coast.  Over the Northwest/northern Rockies expect an
episode of fairly light rain/mountain snow around Thursday
followed by another event late week into next Monday.  Highest
totals with the latter should be over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

Clouds and precipitation will tend to support above normal morning
lows over the eastern U.S. for most of the period.  Some locations
in the Midwest/Great Lakes may see record warm lows on Thursday,
within an area of plus 15-25F anomalies.  High temperatures will
be more moderate but the Great Lakes and vicinity could still see
daytime readings exceed 10F above normal late this week into
Saturday.  Meanwhile expect a localized area of well above normal
temperatures over southern Texas, especially late this week when
highs could reach at least 15F above normal, with a moderating
trend to follow.  Actual high temperatures on Friday are forecast
to exceed the century mark along the Rio Grande Valley.  The
southern half to two-thirds of the West will generally be above
normal through the period with plus 5-12F anomalies for highs.
Farther north expect a couple periods of modestly below normal
highs behind progressive cold fronts.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 11 - 15 2021

There is great uncertainty in the predicted 500-hPa height and surface mean
sea
level pressure patterns across North America between today's 6-10 day 06Z G=
EFS
and 00Z ECMWF ensemble model solutions. The GEFS indicates a closed mean
surface low over the Bering Sea, while the ECMWF ensemble depicts a closed
surface low over the southern Alaska coast. This translates to weaker negat=
ive
mid-level height anomalies in the GEFS and stronger negative anomalies in t=
he
ECMWF ensemble. The ECMWF ensemble also depicts stronger mean surface low
pressure over the Great Lakes during the 6-10 day period, compared to the
GEFS.
Coupled with weak mid-level height anomalies aloft, uncertainty in the
resulting temperature and precipitation fields is increased across the east=
ern
half of the CONUS. However, both models agree well depicting strong positiv=
e
500-hPa height anomalies over the western Labrador Sea, and a southward
extension of these strong positive anomalies into the Northeast CONUS.

Despite differences in the model guidance with respect to the surface and
mid-level height patterns across Alaska, below-normal temperatures are
strongly
favored across much of the state, due to a southerly storm track. Some of t=
he
colder air in western Canada is also expected to drop southward during the =
6-
10
day period, increasing probabilities of below-normal temperatures in the
Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and the Central and Northern Plains. O=
ver
the Great Lakes and Northeast, above-normal temperatures are favored,
associated with strong positive mid-level height anomalies. Weak southeaste=
rly
surface flow in the Southeast and Gulf Coast increases odds of above-normal
temperatures across these regions. In the southwestern CONUS, above-normal
temperatures are favored along the eastern periphery of a mean 500-hPa ridg=
e
over the Northeast Pacific. Ongoing exceptional drought in parts of the reg=
ion
may also support enhanced above-normal temperature odds, due to increased
sensible heat flux near the surface.

With mean mid-level troughing and a southerly storm track across Alaska,
above-normal precipitation is favored across most of the southern half of t=
he
state. From the West Coast of the CONUS eastward to the Central and Norther=
n
Plains, below-normal precipitation is favored on the eastern periphery of t=
he
Northeast Pacific ridge. During the latter half of the 6-10 day period, a
potential strong surface low pressure system may develop over the Midwest,
increasing chances of above-normal precipitation in the Great Lakes. An
associated trailing frontal boundary increases odds farther southward into =
the
Central and Southern Plains. Odds tilt toward above-normal precipitation in
the
Mid-Atlantic, associated with energy exiting the coast early in the period.
During days 6-7, energy riding along the southern periphery of a localized
region of surface high pressure over the Tennessee Valley tilts odds toward
above-normal precipitation in the Florida Peninsula. Forecast tools are in
good
agreement in favoring below-normal precipitation in the Tennessee Valley,
associated with the aforementioned localized region of surface high pressur=
e.
Enhanced below-normal precipitation odds in the Northeast are associated wi=
th
the strong positive mid-level heights extending southward from Canada.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among temperature and precipitation tools in the western CONUS an=
d
Alaska, offset by great uncertainty in the eastern CONUS in depicted mid-le=
vel
height, temperature, and precipitation fields.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 13 - 19 2021

Model uncertainty continues from the 6-10 day period into the Week-2 period=
.
The 06Z GEFS depicts weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies over much of th=
e
CONUS, while the 00Z ECMWF ensemble solution indicates positive (negative)
mid-level height anomalies over the western (eastern) CONUS. Over Alaska, b=
oth
models indicate above-normal mid-level heights across western Alaska. Howev=
er,
the ECMWF ensemble favors stronger mean surface low pressure over the Gulf =
of
Alaska, translating to below-normal mid-level heights across southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Northwest Panhandle.

Similar to the 6-10 day period, a southern storm track across Alaska enhanc=
es
probabilities of below-normal temperatures across much of the state. Despit=
e
onshore mid-level flow in the Pacific Northwest, mainly northerly surface f=
low
is favored, tilting odds toward below-normal temperatures. Sinking air alof=
t
is
favored throughout the Week-2 period, favoring elevated odds of above-norma=
l
temperatures in the Great Basin and Four Corners. Near to above-normal 500-=
hPa
heights across the Northern Tier, extending to the Northeast, favor
above-normal temperatures for these regions. Mean west-northwesterly mid-le=
vel
flow on the west side of a broad long-wave trough over the Atlantic tilts o=
dds
toward below-normal temperatures from the Central and Southern Plains eastw=
ard
to the East Coast. Elevated near to above-normal temperature odds along the
Gulf Coast are associated with weak southeasterly flow during the Week-2
period.

Mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors above-normal
precipitation ahead of this area in the southeastern Mainland and Panhandle=
.
To
the northwest of this area of low pressure, odds tilt toward below-normal
precipitation for the Alaska Peninsula and eastern Aleutians. Below-normal
precipitation is favored underneath high pressure aloft in the Western CONU=
S.
Mean surface high pressure over the eastern CONUS favors increased odds of
below-normal precipitation from the Northern Plains to the Northeast, with =
the
highest probability of drier than normal conditions in the Great Lakes. Mea=
n
southeasterly surface flow out of the Gulf of Mexico, coupled with high
pressure to the north, favors above-normal precipitation from New Mexico
eastward to the Southeast Coast, along a weak mean frontal boundary.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
agreement in the modeled temperature and precipitation fields across the
western CONUS and Alaska, offset by uncertainty in all model fields in the
eastern CONUS.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Mississippi Valley through Tuesday morning...

...Continued much warmer than average temperatures in the western
and central U.S. will support Elevated to Critical Risks of fire
weather...

A slow-moving front extending from the Upper Mississippi Valley
roughly southwestward to the Great Basin will creep eastward to
the Great Lakes by Wednesday.  A strong wave of low pressure will
develop across the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley
Tuesday evening into Wednesday evening.  The Low will propel the
southwestern parts of the front eastward to the Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley into the Southern Plains by Wednesday evening.
The system will then produce showers and thunderstorms over parts
of the Upper Midwest to the Central High Plains overnight Monday.
 The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley through Tuesday morning.
The main hazards associated with the severe thunderstorms will be
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, and hail.  The
severe thunderstorm threat will move southward along and ahead of
the Central Plains boundary on Tuesday and the Lower Mississippi
Valley on Wednesday.  Additionally, rain with embedded
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley on Tuesday that will later expand into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic overnight Tuesday into Wednesday evening.

Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above
average over the Northern/Central Plains and parts of the
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley, mainly on Monday afternoon.
These temperatures will bring the last day of record-breaking
warmth across the southwestern to the north-central U.S., with
temperatures nearing 100 degrees in the Desert Southwest and 80s
as far north as South Dakota and Minnesota on Monday afternoon.
The warmth should ease slightly on Tuesday as it shifts eastward
but remains above normal. The warmth  combined with dry soil,
low relative humidity, and gusty winds  will lead to the
potential for dangerous fire weather conditions.

An Elevated Risk is delineated today across eastern Nevada and the
Four Corners states, with an embedded Critical Risk in
northeastern Arizona.  On Tuesday, an Elevated to Critical Risk is
in place for parts of the Southern Rockies and Southern High
Plains.  Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches are also in
effect for these areas.  Additionally, an Elevated Risk for fire
weather is in place through Monday evening over the southern
portions of the Northeast and the northern Mid-Atlantic, given dry
and windy conditions. Furthermore, the upper-level energy
associated with the system will produce snow over parts of the
Northern Rockies overnight Monday into the Central Rockies and
central High Plains on Tuesday into Tuesday night, winding down on
Wednesday.

0109 AM CDT Tue Apr 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-low will move through the Great Basin and reach the
Four Corners toward by midday. Strong mid-level flow will develop on
the southern flank of the low across much of central Arizona
eastward into central/southern New Mexico. At the surface, a cyclone
will deepen along the Kansas/Colorado border before evolving into an
elongated surface trough from the southern High Plains northeastward
through eastern Nebraska by early evening. A cold front will
progress through the Southwest and into the Southern Plains.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical fire weather is likely to occur tomorrow
afternoon. The strong mid-level winds will be favorably timed with
peak boundary-layer mixing across New Mexico, especially.
Single-digit RH is probable over much of the region increasing to
around 15% around the fringes of the risk area. The deepening
surface low will help to enhance surface winds to 20-30 mph. Locally
extremely critical conditions may occur, particularly in southern
New Mexico border where the mid-level jet will be. However, ERCs are
only near the 50th percentile which should limit more extreme fire
behavior. Elevated conditions will extend both westward and eastward
where weaker winds and marginal fuels will limit critical fire
weather, respectively.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance continues to suggest that strong positive height
anomalies east of Hudson Bay and associated upper ridging will
support a mean trough aloft centered near the Upper Midwest.  As a
result low pressure systems associated with shortwaves entering
western North America will tend to gravitate toward that region
and the Great Lakes.  Models and ensembles are still showing some
spread for details within the blocky pattern, with predictability
for some specifics typically not very high given the likelihood of
various closed features between the northeastern quadrant of the
lower 48 and eastern Canada/North Atlantic.

Between Friday and Sunday the models are gradually refining the
details of how shortwave energy initially over the northern High
Plains will close off an upper low and displace a leading Midwest
system.  Consensus for the associated surface evolution is for the
leading low to lift northward while a developing southern
Plains/Mississippi Valley wave tracks into the Great Lakes.  A
leading wavy front extending through the Mid-Atlantic has trended
somewhat northward from recent continuity, with 18Z/00Z GFS runs
on the northern side of the spread.  GEFS means are a little less
extreme in that regard, recommending a more moderate continuity
adjustment.  Further adjustments can be made if these trends
continue.

Farther upstream the guidance is well clustered for another
vigorous shortwave reaching western North America by early
Saturday.  Most solutions say this feature will close off another
upper low which should track over or near the northern tier
states.  18Z/00Z GFS and GEFS mean runs have trended a bit
eastward of established consensus for this feature late in the
period.  For now would favor leaning somewhat more toward the 12Z
run for GFS/GEFS input.

By next Monday-Tuesday a number of recent GFS runs have wanted to
dig a fairly deep trough/upper low over the West.  Teleconnections
relative to the eastern Canada ridging favor some modest troughing
over the southwestern U.S./far northwestern Mexico but not so much
troughing over the Northwest, while some ridging should extend
into western Canada.  GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means all compare more
favorably to teleconnection-favored flow over the West.

Based on the above considerations, the forecast blend started with
a 12Z model composite early in the period followed by increasing
12Z GEFS/ECMWF/CMC mean input with the rest consisting of the only
the last two ECMWF runs by day 7 Tuesday.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The forecast pattern will likely produce a fairly broad area of
precipitation over the eastern half of the lower 48 for portions
of the period.  The best signal for heaviest rainfall currently
exists from near the Gulf Coast into the southern-central
Appalachians, and possibly west into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys,
late this week into the weekend.  During this time frame there
will be a decent flow of Gulf moisture ahead of southern Plains
into Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes surface development that will
be supported by High Plains into Midwest dynamics aloft.  Separate
southern stream energy will also likely to play a role in southern
tier rain/thunderstorms.

The Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies will see a period
of rain and mountain snow from late this week into the weekend.
The forecast has been consistent in showing highest liquid totals
over the Olympics and Washington Cascades.  By late weekend into
early next week the associated development at the surface and
aloft may produce areas of enhanced precipitation over the
northern Plains and vicinity.  Some of this precipitation could
fall in the form of snow.  Other areas of rain may develop farther
south over the central U.S.  The majority of guidance indicates a
drying trend to the west of the Plains early next week but there
is still a modest potential for some precipitation to linger over
the north-central Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies will be over southern Texas
on Friday with highs up to 10-20F above normal and over portions
of the East from late week into the weekend, especially for
morning lows that will be 10-20F above normal due to warm moist
flow ahead of an initial system and trailing development.
Portions of the Great Lakes could see morning lows near record
warm values on Friday.  Best potential for highs 10-15F above
normal will be over the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes area
Friday-Saturday.  From the weekend into early next week expect
highs of 5-15F below normal to progress across the Northwest and
northern Rockies behind a cold front pushing through the Northwest
and into the Plains.  Anomalies may moderate a bit by the time the
airmass reaches the Plains.  The southern half of the West will
tend to see above normal temperatures with most anomalies in the
plus 5-12F range.  Warmest days should be Friday-Saturday with a
slight rebound again over the West Coast states next Tuesday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the central Plains will slow and become
more negatively tilted on Wednesday. This will strengthen a belt of
northwesterly winds aloft across the Southwest. At the surface, the
cyclone within the lower-Missouri Valley will move northeastward and
weaken through the day. A cold front will progress to near the Gulf
coast.

...New Mexico...West Texas...
Elevated to critical fire weather is expected to develop during the
afternoon as mid-level winds mix to the surface. Very dry air will
remain across the region with RH dropping to 5-15%. With the surface
low displaced much further east and weakening with time, surface
winds will generally be lighter. Most locations will see 15-20 mph.
Central New Mexico is the most likely area for sustained critical
conditions to develop given the western extension of the mid-level
jet overhead.

...Rain and the potential for severe thunderstorms are expected
for the central U.S. for the next couple of days...

...Several inches of snow are possible in and around Wyoming and
western South Dakota and Nebraska through tonight...

...Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for the Southwest
and Southern High Plains through Wednesday...

A surface low is forecast to slowly move across the central U.S.
through Thursday, sweeping a cold front through the
Southern/Central Plains and Mississippi Valley while a
quasi-stationary front meanders across the the Upper Midwest. This
system will produce widespread rain and thunderstorms over these
areas, and thunderstorms could be severe. The Storm Prediction
Center has delineated a Slight Risk of severe weather especially
for hail and wind threats over the Central Plains today and
tonight. Then on Wednesday, a Slight Risk of severe weather shifts
to the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, with a Marginal
Risk stretching farther north. Additionally, the widespread rain
and thunderstorms could produce 1 to locally 3 inches of rain for
eastern South Dakota into the Upper Mississippi Valley near the
stationary front through Thursday, and isolated flooding cannot be
ruled out. Farther south, some areas in the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys could receive a couple of inches of rain on
Wednesday and Wednesday night, which could cause flooding or flash
flooding given the wet ground conditions, and there is a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall in place there.

Behind the surface low pressure system, the associated upper-level
low will cause below normal temperatures and provide lift for snow
to develop in the Northern/Central Rockies and High Plains through
tonight. Higher elevations of the Wind River Mountains, Bighorn
Mountains, and Black Hills could see 6+ inches of snow, while
lower elevations of the Central Rockies and Central High Plains
could see some snow, but lighter amounts. Winter Storm Warnings
are in place for the Black Hills, while higher elevations of
Wyoming and south-central Montana have Winter Weather Advisories
in effect for this snow event.

In the Southwest to Southern High Plains, warm temperatures are
forecast along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values,
and this combination will lead to the potential for dangerous fire
weather conditions. A Critical Risk is outlooked by the Storm
Prediction Center today, and widespread Red Flag Warnings are in
effect as well. Elevated to Critical Risks are once again in place
for much of New Mexico and West Texas on Wednesday. Warmer than
average temperatures are expected for much of the contiguous U.S.,
with the exception of parts of the north-central U.S. underneath
the upper low, and cooler temperatures spreading into the
Northwest for midweek. The highest temperature anomalies are for
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions, with highs around 15 to
25 degrees above normal through Thursday.

Elsewhere, Maine could continue to see light precipitation today
on the backside of a lingering surface low pressure system in the
Atlantic. The Northwest can expect increasing precipitation
Wednesday into Thursday as another frontal system and additional
upper-level energy comes in. Over a foot of snow is forecast for
the Cascades for Wednesday into Wednesday night.

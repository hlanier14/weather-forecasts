Minor modifications were made to the isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights to reflect the latest model guidance. Otherwise, the
previous forecast remains on track. Please see the previous forecast
below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 07/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CDT Fri Jul 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a weak upper-level impulse
over the Great Basin that is providing sufficient lift for scattered
monsoonal thunderstorms over parts of the Intermountain West. This
feature will gradually shift north over the next 24 hours on the
western periphery of a persistent ridge. While this feature will
yield a nebulous surface pressure pattern and weak winds, it will
maintain thunderstorm chances across much of the West, including
areas of the Pacific Northwest where fuels have largely struggled to
recover despite a modest influx of monsoonal moisture.

...Pacific Northwest...
Isolated thunderstorms, already ongoing across parts of
south-central OR, are expected to increase in coverage through the
mid to late afternoon from the West Coast into central ID and far
southwest MT. A northward flux of mid-level moisture will maintain
PWAT values above 0.75 inches, but dry boundary layers on the
periphery of the deeper moisture (as sampled by the 00z MFR and BOI
soundings) may limit rainfall amounts at the surface to isolated
cores. Although several surface stations have reported wetting
rainfall over the past few days, recent fuel reports from the region
indicate that dry fuels are slow to respond to the recent moisture
and are still promoting active fire behavior. The combination of
wet/dry thunderstorm chances and dry fuels supports the isolated
dry-thunderstorm risk. A few dry lightning strikes are possible as
far northeast as north-central MT, but a combination of weaker
forcing for ascent (and hence less confidence in coverage) as well
as slightly improved boundary-layer RH precludes an expansion into
this region.

...Lingering monsoonal moisture and heavier rain for parts of the
Interior West on Monday..

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...


...Overview...

Positive height anomalies over western/central Canada and
southwest of California will favor continued troughing in the
eastern states next week. This will promote cooler than normal
temperatures east of the Plains with highest rainfall chances
along and ahead of a slowly southward-moving cold front into the
Southeast. The Interior West will see diminishing rainfall,
focused along the Rockies and perhaps shifting to the Plains later
next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the week. The differences lie in the details
difficult to resolve at this time scale. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/ECENS mean a little
bit slower than the GFS/GEFS mean. The lack of a clear upstream
kicker over Alaska would favor the slower solutions, but a general
blend of the ECMWF/GFS with the means gets us a good starting
point. The CMC seems too quick to bring lower heights into the
West and also quicker to erode troughing over the Ohio Valley and
push it eastward the latter half of the week. Thus, the CMC was
excluded from the blend during the late periods. This cycle of the
WPC forecast favored a blend of the deterministic guidance days
3-5, with modest weighting towards the means by days 6 and 7.
Continued more than usual blending of the ECMWF/GFS later in the
period just for some added strength and definition to individual
features typically washed out by the means. This approach also
maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With the upper high around the lower CO River Monday, mid-level
energy will spur afternoon convection over the northern/central
Rockies, some of which may contain heavier rain. As heights build
a bit over the Southwest, the moisture source will decrease and
rain coverage/intensity will decrease through the week. In the
East/Southeast, troughing will push a cold front close to or into
the Gulf of Mexico by midweek. Abundant moisture ahead of the
boundary will support heavier rain chances anywhere from Texas
eastward to the Carolinas. As the upper pattern remains mostly in
place, the front may wobble about due, in part, to areas of low
pressure that may act to enhance rainfall into the Mid-Atlantic.

Temperatures will slowly moderate from below normal in much of the
Interior West (owing to clouds and rainfall) early in the week to
near or slightly above normal by the end of next week. Areas along
the Canadian border may see the warmest anomalies of +5 to +10
from eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes. Much of the
East/Southeast will see near to below normal temperatures along
and behind the cold front, perhaps as much as 10 degrees below
normal for early August on some days.

...Lingering monsoonal moisture and heavier rain for parts of the
Interior West on Monday..

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...


...Overview...

Positive height anomalies over western/central Canada and
southwest of California will favor continued troughing in the
eastern states next week. This will promote cooler than normal
temperatures east of the Plains with highest rainfall chances
along and ahead of a slowly southward-moving cold front into the
Southeast. The Interior West will see diminishing rainfall,
focused along the Rockies and perhaps shifting to the Plains later
next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the week. The differences lie in the details
difficult to resolve at this time scale. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/ECENS mean a little
bit slower than the GFS/GEFS mean. The lack of a clear upstream
kicker over Alaska would favor the slower solutions, but a general
blend of the ECMWF/GFS with the means gets us a good starting
point. The CMC seems too quick to bring lower heights into the
West and also quicker to erode troughing over the Ohio Valley and
push it eastward the latter half of the week. Thus, the CMC was
excluded from the blend during the late periods. This cycle of the
WPC forecast favored a blend of the deterministic guidance days
3-5, with modest weighting towards the means by days 6 and 7.
Continued more than usual blending of the ECMWF/GFS later in the
period just for some added strength and definition to individual
features typically washed out by the means. This approach also
maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With the upper high around the lower CO River Monday, mid-level
energy will spur afternoon convection over the northern/central
Rockies, some of which may contain heavier rain. As heights build
a bit over the Southwest, the moisture source will decrease and
rain coverage/intensity will decrease through the week. In the
East/Southeast, troughing will push a cold front close to or into
the Gulf of Mexico by midweek. Abundant moisture ahead of the
boundary will support heavier rain chances anywhere from Texas
eastward to the Carolinas. As the upper pattern remains mostly in
place, the front may wobble about due, in part, to areas of low
pressure that may act to enhance rainfall into the Mid-Atlantic.

Temperatures will slowly moderate from below normal in much of the
Interior West (owing to clouds and rainfall) early in the week to
near or slightly above normal by the end of next week. Areas along
the Canadian border may see the warmest anomalies of +5 to +10
from eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes. Much of the
East/Southeast will see near to below normal temperatures along
and behind the cold front, perhaps as much as 10 degrees below
normal for early August on some days.

AUMvLGB6VFp$

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 07 - FRIDAY AUGUST 13: There is good agreement in this
morning's GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height forecasts featuring a=
n
anomalous ridge center over eastern Maritime Canada that looks to persist i=
nto
the middle of August. Tied to this mid-level feature, however, there is a
broader coverage of positive height departures depicted in the 0z GEFS, whi=
ch
extends from the north-central to the eastern CONUS, whereas the ECMWF favo=
rs
much of the anomalous mid-level ridging further north through the middle
portion of week-2. Upstream, both ensembles continue to advertise the
development of shortwave troughing over the eastern Pacific that shifts
eastward into the northwestern CONUS early in the period. This mid-level
feature appears to be more amplified compared to previous model runs, which=
 is
expected to bring relatively cooler temperatures across the West Coast, and
lower the potential for excessive heat over this part of the country in
today's
hazard outlook.



The persistence of anomalous mid-level ridging throughout the northern CONU=
S
in
the ensembles is likely to prolong the potential excessive heat during the
entirety of week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate eleva=
ted
probabilities in excess of 40% for maximum daily temperatures exceeding the
85th percentile and 90 degrees F across the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley through the middle portion of the period. Compared to
yesterday's guidance, the GEFS reforecast tool depicts a larger coverage of
these elevated probabilities further south, where the 6z deterministic GFS
indicates heat index values surpassing 105 degrees across parts of Nebraska
and
Iowa early in the period. Thus, a moderate risk for excessive heat is expan=
ded
to the south and extended through day 11 (Aug 10).  A broader slight risk a=
rea
for excessive heat is also posted across much of the north-central CONUS fo=
r
the entirety of week-2 where both reforecast tools depict at least a 20%
chance
of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. With models favoring
more troughing aloft over the western CONUS, there is decreased support for
excessive heat in the reforecast guidance and a slight risk area for excess=
ive
heat has been discontinued across this area relative to yesterday's outlook=
.
The continuation of above-normal temperatures during week-2 is anticipated =
to
worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to exceptional drought (D4) conditions being f=
elt
throughout much of the western and central CONUS, as well as further dry fu=
els
and sustain an elevated wildfire risk. Farther east, there are increased
probabilities of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile in the
reforecast tools tied to the increased mid-level heights favored over the
northeastern CONUS. However, these tools remain unsupportive of actual
temperatures reaching hazard thresholds, thus no corresponding hazards are
issued.



Model guidance depicts shortwave troughing across the Plains and the
Mississippi Valley early in the period, where there is the potential for
surface low formation. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles show increased
precipitation amounts over parts of the Middle Mississippi, Ohio and Tennes=
see
Valleys where the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 20% chance 3-day
rainfall accumulations exceed the 85th percentile during days 8-10 over the
region. However, there is much less support from the GEFS in this realizati=
on,
and there is insufficient confidence that rainfall will be heavy enough,
precluding a related precipitation hazard from being designated in the
outlook.



In the Pacific Northwest, the aforementioned mid-level trough is expected t=
o
promote above-normal precipitation through the middle portion of the period=
.
However, these amounts are not expected to reach hazard thresholds, as any
increase in precipitation should benefit moisture starved soils in the
Northwest. Across the Desert Southwest, ensemble means feature the mid-leve=
l
ridge axis displaced to the south of the Four Corners region, which is
anticipated to suppress monsoonal moisture advection. However, tropical
cyclone
activity favored in the East Pacific during week-2 may help initiate a Gulf=
 of
California moisture surge event and increase the potential for heavy rainfa=
ll
in the Desert Southwest.



Across Alaska, the deterministic GFS continues to favor the potential for
heavy
precipitation during week-1 with localized daily amounts in excess of 2 inc=
hes
for parts of the western Mainland by this weekend. This wet pattern looks t=
o
continue during week-2, with mid-level troughing and surface low formation
favored across the Bering Sea where reforecast tools indicate elevated chan=
ces
for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile across parts =
of
the western and southern Mainland. The continued wet pattern may adversely
affect antecedent wet conditions, and a slight risk of heavy precipitation
remains posted across the western and southern Mainland during early week-2=
.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 05 - 09 2021

Todays numerical model solutions from the GEFS and ECMWF forecast suites ar=
e
in decent agreement with respect to the location of major 500-hPa height
features across the forecast domain, but disagree somewhat in their
intensities, particularly across the CONUS. A persistent and anomalously
strong
closed 500-hPa low is predicted over the Bering Sea and shows an eastward
progression, relative to yesterdays 6-10 day forecast. A split-flow pattern=
 is
predicted downstream of the closed low over the Bering Sea, leading to weak
ridging across southeastern Alaska and troughing forecast farther to the so=
uth
along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The mean trough along the Pacific
Northwest coast is slightly more amplified compared to yesterdays forecast,
leading to below-normal mid-level heights across much of the region.
Below-normal 500-hPa heights are also favored, and have increased in covera=
ge
since yesterday, over the east-central CONUS from the Corn Belt southward t=
o
the Gulf Coast, underneath a mean trough. Subtropical ridging is expected t=
o
erode and deamplify over the west-central CONUS, causing the mean mid-level
height center over the Four Corners to shift farther southward into western
New
Mexico, further reducing the potential for northward monsoonal moisture
advection.

Above-normal temperatures are favored across extreme southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, associated with a mean mid-level ridge and
above-normal 500-hPa heights ahead of a closed mid-level low forecast over =
the
Bering Sea. Eastward progression of the mean closed low over the Bering Sea
into western Alaska increases odds of below-normal temperatures for the
western
Mainland and the Aleutians. Amplified mean troughing along the coast of the
Pacific Northwest favors near-normal temperatures for much of the region.
Subtropical ridging is expected to deamplify during the 6-10 day period ove=
r
the west-central CONUS, due to the eastward progression and amplification o=
f
the upstream trough over the Pacific Northwest. Despite deamplification of =
the
mean ridge, above-normal temperatures remain favored for much of the
southwestern CONUS. Mean southerly surface flow enhances odds of above-norm=
al
temperatures across the Central and Northern Plains, Upper Midwest and Grea=
t
Lakes, extending eastward to New England. Enhanced probabilities of
below-normal temperatures are forecast for the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley, and much of the Southeast, associated with a negative
mid-level height anomalies over the lower east-central CONUS. Over the
southern
Florida Peninsula, above-normal temperatures are favored ahead of a mean
frontal boundary.

Ahead of the closed mid-level low predicted over the Bering Sea, above-norm=
al
precipitation is favored over much of Mainland Alaska and the eastern
Aleutians. Downstream, mean troughing to the south of the split mid-level f=
low
along northern portions of the West Coast favors above-normal precipitation=
 in
the Pacific Northwest. A mean ridge over the west-central CONUS favors
increased odds for below-normal precipitation across the Great Basin, Easte=
rn
Rockies, and Central and Northern Plains. In the Southwest, model solutions
are
in agreement regarding a southward displacement of the mean positive 500-hP=
a
height anomaly center over the Four Corners, favoring suppression of northw=
ard
monsoonal moisture surges. Farther east, surface high pressure is expected =
to
dominate across much of the eastern CONUS, leading to below-normal
precipitation probabilities across the Midwest and Ohio and Middle Mississi=
ppi
Valleys. Odds tilt toward below-normal precipitation across northern New
England, underneath positive mid-level height anomalies. The Atlantic
subtropical ridge is expected to start building back its western periphery
during the 6-10 day period, increasing odds for above-normal precipitation
across the Southeast and Gulf Coast along a mean frontal boundary.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5 due to bet=
ter
agreement of the model temperature and precipitation fields across much of =
the
forecast domain, offset by large differences in the precipitation fields in
the
eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 07 - 13 2021

During the Week-2 period, numerical model guidance depicts a generally simi=
lar
500-hPa flow pattern to that predicted for the 6-10 day period in terms of
phasing, but deamplified. A strong mid-level trough is forecast to persist =
and
progress eastward over the Bering Sea and western Mainland Alaska during th=
e
Week-2 period, continuing an active pattern for western and interior Alaska=
.
Downstream, very weak ridging is forecast to continue, but continue to
deamplify, over southeastern Alaska, and a mean trough is forecast farther =
to
the south along the coast of the Pacific Northwest. The ridge and trough
pattern over the central and eastern CONUS, respectively, are favored to
deamplify, leading to increased zonal mid-level flow during Week-2.

Enhanced southwesterly onshore flow ahead of a mean mid-level trough over t=
he
eastern Bering Sea, that continues to progress eastward in todays model
solutions, favors increased odds for below-normal temperatures over much of
Alaska, with enhanced odds over the Southwest Mainland. Above-normal
temperatures are favored along the West Coast and into the Great Basin, but
above-normal probabilities are reduced in magnitude compared to yesterdays
Week-2 forecast, as the mean ridge over the west-central CONUS is expected =
to
deamplify. Enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities are favored from
the
Northern Plains eastward to the Great Lakes, underneath increased 500-hPa
heights and mean southerly surface flow. From Texas eastward across the Dee=
p
South to the Southeast Coast, below-normal temperatures are favored early i=
n
the Week-2 period before moderating in the latter half of the period, tilti=
ng
odds toward below-normal temperatures. Ahead of a mean frontal boundary ove=
r
the Southeast, above-normal temperatures are favored for the Florida
Peninsula.

With the persistent mid-level low forecast over the eastern Bering Sea, an
active, wetter-than-normal pattern is forecast to continue well into Week-2
across Mainland Alaska into the Panhandle. Odds of above-normal precipitati=
on
are also increased across parts of the Pacific Northwest, ahead of a mean
trough along the Pacific Northwest Coast and increased onshore flow.
Below-normal precipitation is favored for much of the Great Basin, Eastern
Rockies, and Great Plains, associated with mean subtropical ridging across =
the
west-central CONUS that is expected to deamplify during the period. The
positive mid-level height anomaly center over the Four Corners is favored t=
o
retain its southward position, which would tend to suppress any major
northward surges of monsoonal moisture across the Southwest. However, there=
 is
the potential for a brief moisture surge during the Week-2 period, associat=
ed
with the potential passage of a tropical cyclone south of the Gulf of
California in the Eastern Pacific, increasing uncertainty. From the Tenness=
ee
Valley northward to the Great Lakes, there are increased odds of above-norm=
al
precipitation, as the mean trough over the eastern CONUS is favored to
deamplify and lift northward into the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
agreement in synoptic-scale features and patterns, offset by differences in
magnitudes of these features and some differences among the model temperatu=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

...Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rain across
parts of Nebraska tonight and then toward the Middle Mississippi
Valley early on Saturday...

...More monsoonal moisture expected across the interior western
U.S. with increasing focus over central Colorado and the northern
Great Basin...

...Excessive heat continues for the interior Pacific Northwest,
central U.S., and Deep South into the weekend before much cooler
temperatures overspread these regions...

A deepening low pressure system entering the Canadian Maritimes
tonight will usher in a much cooler and drier airmass to the
Northeast, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic through the weekend. This
will bring welcome relief after the recent spell of summer heat
and humidity across parts of these areas. Much of the heat and
tropical humidity will remain across the central Plains, Deep
South, and into the Southeast this evening ahead of the trailing
front. Heat indices well above 100 degrees are likely throughout
these regions. Relief is on the way, but not until the end of the
weekend for some as much cooler temperatures enter from the north.
Meanwhile, a low pressure wave developing over the central High
Plains is forecast to trigger organized thunderstorms that could
become severe this evening across parts of Nebraska before moving
toward the Middle Mississippi Valley into Saturday morning.
Isolated tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail are
possible. In addition, heavy rain associated with the
thunderstorms could trigger flash flooding.

Over the western U.S., a persistent ridge of high pressure aloft
will continue to sustain the excessive heat across the interior
Pacific Northwest through Saturday. High temperatures are forecast
to reach into the upper 90s and triple digits, which equates to
around 10 to 20 degrees above average. Farther south, monsoonal
moisture continues to bring much needed rainfall to the
drought-stricken regions of the West. The broad area of monsoonal
showers and thunderstorms is expected to show increasing focus
across central Colorado as well as spreading further north into
the northern Great Basin during the weekend, where the threat of
heavy rainfall and flash flooding will increase.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts are currently in effect for portions of
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa
due to smoke associated with ongoing wildfires over western North
America being advected into the regions by the prevailing
north-northwesterly winds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Fri Jul 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains generally on track. A couple dry
strikes may accompany storms preceding potentially heavier rainfall
tomorrow afternoon across portions of eastern Washington into
northern Idaho. However, given the possibility for accumulating
rainfall across eastern Washington into northern Idaho later
tomorrow (Saturday) night into Sunday, isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights were not introduced for this outlook.

Locally dry and breezy conditions remain possible across parts of
the Pacific Northwest into Montana and the northern Plains tomorrow
afternoon and evening. At the moment, guidance members have not
reached a consensus on any particular area experiencing Elevated
overlapping surface winds/RH for any prolonged period of time, hence
no highlights added. However, an Elevated delineation may be
introduced by Day 1 should guidance consensus trend drier and
windier across portions of Montana into the northern Plains.

..Squitieri.. 07/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Fri Jul 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The weak upper-level impulse currently over the Great Basin will
shift into the Pacific Northwest through the day Saturday. Deeper
monsoonal moisture will accompany this feature and increase
probabilities for wetting rainfall. This will also result in
widespread cloud cover and relatively weak flow at the surface,
reducing the potential for wind/RH-driven fire weather threats
(though local concerns are possible).

...Pacific Northwest...
Rain chances will spread from southern ID and southeast OR northward
into western ID/southeast WA through the day Saturday. Ensemble
guidance shows the highest probabilities for wetting rainfall across
eastern OR/southern ID by late Saturday night. While thunderstorms
are likely along and east of the Cascades, muted boundary-layer
heating/mixing and wetting rainfall potential will limit the
dry-thunderstorm risk. Localized elevated wind/RH conditions may
develop across southeastern WA and central MT Saturday afternoon as
winds increase to near 15 mph amid 15-20% RH and dry fuels. However,
ensemble guidance shows low probability for sustained 15+ mph winds
and cloud cover will likely limit RH reductions and boundary-layer
heating. As such, no risk areas are introduced.

...Lingering monsoonal moisture and heavier rain for parts of the
Interior West on Monday..

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...


...Overview...

Positive height anomalies over western/central Canada and
southwest of California will favor continued troughing in the
eastern states next week. This will promote cooler than normal
temperatures east of the Plains with highest rainfall chances
along and ahead of a slowly southward-moving cold front into the
Southeast. The Interior West will see diminishing rainfall,
focused along the Rockies and perhaps shifting to the Plains later
next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the week. The differences lie in the details
difficult to resolve at this time scale. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/ECENS mean a little
bit slower than the GFS/GEFS mean. The lack of a clear upstream
kicker over Alaska would favor the slower solutions, but a general
blend of the ECMWF/GFS with the means gets us a good starting
point. The CMC seems too quick to bring lower heights into the
West and also quicker to erode troughing over the Ohio Valley and
push it eastward the latter half of the week. Thus, the CMC was
excluded from the blend during the late periods. This cycle of the
WPC forecast favored a blend of the deterministic guidance days
3-5, with modest weighting towards the means by days 6 and 7.
Continued more than usual blending of the ECMWF/GFS later in the
period just for some added strength and definition to individual
features typically washed out by the means. This approach also
maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With the upper high around the lower CO River Monday, mid-level
energy will spur afternoon convection over the northern/central
Rockies, some of which may contain heavier rain. As heights build
a bit over the Southwest, the moisture source will decrease and
rain coverage/intensity will decrease through the week. In the
East/Southeast, troughing will push a cold front close to or into
the Gulf of Mexico by midweek. Abundant moisture ahead of the
boundary will support heavier rain chances anywhere from Texas
eastward to the Carolinas. As the upper pattern remains mostly in
place, the front may wobble about due, in part, to areas of low
pressure that may act to enhance rainfall into the Mid-Atlantic.

Temperatures will slowly moderate from below normal in much of the
Interior West (owing to clouds and rainfall) early in the week to
near or slightly above normal by the end of next week. Areas along
the Canadian border may see the warmest anomalies of +5 to +10
from eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes. Much of the
East/Southeast will see near to below normal temperatures along
and behind the cold front, perhaps as much as 10 degrees below
normal for early August on some days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1243 AM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
The weak upper-level impulse that has brought widespread showers and
thunderstorms to the West over the past two days is noted over
northeast Nevada in early-morning IR imagery and radar mosaics. This
feature will continue to gradually shift to the north/northwest into
southeast Oregon and southwest Idaho today. Deeper monsoonal
moisture will accompany the impulse and support increasing
thunderstorm and wetting rainfall chances across Oregon and southern
Idaho. Isolated dry thunderstorms are possible closer to the
international border on the northern periphery of the monsoonal
moisture. Weak low pressure over the West will maintain weak
gradient winds at the surface and reduce the potential for robust
wind/RH-driven fire weather concerns.

...Eastern Washington and northern Idaho...
Despite an increase in column precipitable water over the past 24
hours, the observed 00z sounding from OTX reveals modest mid-level
moisture atop a dry boundary layer. Low-level trajectories emanating
from southwest Canada will maintain this dry layer through the day.
While boundary-layer heating/mixing may be muted by increasing cloud
cover, forecast soundings suggest increasing mid-level moisture will
support sufficient destabilization for at least isolated
thunderstorm chances by late afternoon. A mixture of wet/dry
thunderstorms appears likely for this region, but given antecedent
dry fuels, ongoing fire activity, and the dry conditions expected at
the surface outside of precipitation cores, an isolated
dry-thunderstorm risk area is introduced.

Localized elevated wind/RH conditions may occur this afternoon
across this region as well as across central MT. However, muted
daytime heating and generally weak pressure-gradient winds will
limit the coverage and duration of these conditions.

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the
Southeast...

...Overview...

Troughing will persist next week over the East, in between
flattening ridging out of western/central Canada and over the
Atlantic. This favors bouts of rainfall along a
slowly-moving/stalled front across the Carolinas back through the
Southeast into the southern Plains. Multi-day rainfall could
exceed several inches over parts of the Carolinas. The upper high
over the Southwest will meander in place, shifting the moisture
axis primarily to the Rockies and Front Range.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest models and ensembles remain in good agreement on the large
scale pattern through the period. Recent deterministic runs
continue to waver on how quickly (or slowly) to bring height falls
into the Pac NW later in the week with ECMWF/Canadian/ECENS mean a
little bit slower than the GFS and many GEFS members. The lack of
a clear upstream kicker over Alaska would favor the slower
solutions, but the upper low could unwind in pieces which would
send in some lower heights into WA/OR. Favored a blend of the
deterministic guidance days 3-5, trending toward the 12Z ECMWF and
the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECENS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Focus for impactful weather will lie over the North/South Carolina
coast in the vicinity of the frontal boundary. With ample moisture
off the Atlantic, daily rounds of showers and storms will be
likely through the period. Guidance indicates several inches of
rainfall over a fairly large area which seems reasonable given the
setup. Less rainfall is expected farther west along the boundary
along the Gulf Coast back into Texas. Over the Northwest,
approaching system will eventually bring in some light rain to
coastal Washington by Friday into the northern Rockies (ID/MT) as
the front moves ashore.

Temperatures will be within a few degrees of normal over much of
the West with areas along the Canadian border likely to see
temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal from eastern Montana to
the western Great Lakes. Much of the East/Southeast will see near
to below normal max temperatures along and behind the cold front,
perhaps as much as 10 degrees below normal for early August on
some days over Texas/New Mexico and over the Carolinas. Low
temperatures will be closer to normal in the Southeast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Sat Jul 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Rain chances will continue to overspread the Pacific Northwest
through the day Sunday as a weak upper-level impulse translates
north within the mean flow regime. While this will maintain
thunderstorm chances across the region, beneficial rainfall may help
mitigate fuel dryness to some degree. A weak surface low is forecast
to deepen east of the Cascades Sunday afternoon, which should
augment surface winds across the northern Rockies and may support
regional fire weather concerns outside of the corridor of better
rain chances. Elsewhere across the West, weak surface pressure
gradients and recent rainfall will limit additional fire weather
concerns.

...Central Montana...
Elevated wind/RH conditions are possible across parts of central MT
Sunday afternoon. Easterly winds are forecast to increase in
response to the deepening low over eastern OR/WA, and ensemble
guidance shows reasonable probabilities for sustained winds near 15
mph. Dry conditions are noted across this region with 10-hour fuel
moisture values near 5%, and afternoon RH reductions to 15-20%
appear likely as drier continental air filters in from Canada and
the northern Plains. While elevated conditions are probable, the
potential for critical wind speeds is low.

...Strong to severe thunderstorms with locally heavy rain from
Nebraska to the mid-Mississippi Valley today should become less
robust as they reach the Tennessee Valley on Sunday...

...More monsoonal moisture expected across the interior western
U.S. with increasing focus over central Colorado and the northern
Great Basin...

...Excessive heat continues today over the interior Pacific
Northwest, the central U.S., and the Deep South before a cooling
trend sets in on Sunday...

A much cooler and drier airmass continues to be ushered further
south into the eastern U.S. behind a departing low pressure system
over the Canadian Maritimes, bringing welcome relief to the recent
spell of summer heat and humidity across parts of the areas.
Meanwhile, much of the heat and tropical humidity will remain
across the central Plains, Deep South, and into the Southeast
today where heat indices well above 100 degrees are likely
throughout these regions.  Relief is on the way for the central
Plains by Monday as the cool air arrives.  However, much of the
Deep South will remain in the hot and humid air into Monday, only
to be cooled slightly by an increasing chance of showers and
thunderstorms as the front edges closer from the north.  A low
pressure wave developing over the central High Plains is expected
to trigger organized thunderstorms that could bring isolated
tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and large hail today from Nebraska
to the mid-Mississippi Valley.  In addition, heavy rain associated
with the thunderstorms could trigger flash flooding.  Less
favorable upper-level dynamics should then weaken the
thunderstorms slightly on Sunday as they reach the Tennessee
Valley.  Meanwhile, a reinforcing push of cooler air from Canada
will bring a swath of showers and some thunderstorms across the
Great Lakes today, reaching western/northern New England by Monday
morning.  This system will attempt to merge with the
aforementioned low pressure wave reaching the Mi-Atlantic coast by
Monday morning to produce a period of strong to possibly severe
thunderstorms near the Mid-Atlantic coast.

Over the western U.S., a persistent ridge of high pressure aloft
will continue to sustain the excessive heat for one more day today
across the interior Pacific Northwest before the arrival of
moisture from the south cools down the temperatures on Sunday.
Farther south, monsoonal moisture continues to bring much needed
rainfall to the drought-stricken regions of the West.  This broad
area of monsoonal showers and thunderstorms is expected to show
increasing focus across central Colorado as well as spreading
further north into the northern Great Basin today, where the
threat of heavy rainfall and flash flooding will increase.  The
heavy rain threat over central Colorado is forecast to slide
southeastward into the central High Plains on Sunday behind a low
pressure wave.

Lastly, Air Quality Alerts are currently in effect for portions of
Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa
due to smoke associated with ongoing wildfires over western North
America being advected into the regions by the prevailing
north-northwesterly winds.

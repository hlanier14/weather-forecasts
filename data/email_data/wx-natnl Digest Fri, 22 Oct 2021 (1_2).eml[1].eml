30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR NOVEMBER 2021

The November 2021 outlook is prepared against the backdrop of recently
developed La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions in equatorial Pacific sea sur=
face temperatures
(SSTs) and the tropical Pacific atmosphere. The developed La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa conditions
were a primary factor in the outlook given the moderate strength La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
predicted for November. Due to destructive interference from the developmen=
t
of
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, the MJO has weakened substantially and did not no=
tably contribute to
the outlook. Coastal SST anomalies remain a factor in the outlook, as do
precipitation and temperature trends. Statistical, hybrid, and dynamical mo=
del
based forecast guidance contribute significantly to the November outlook.



For temperature, elevated probabilities of above-normal monthly mean Novemb=
er
temperatures are depicted across much of the contiguous U.S. with the regio=
n
stretching from the western U.S. eastward to cover much of the central and
southern Great Plains, Ohio Valley, and the Eastern Seaboard. The greatest
odds
are over the southwestern U.S., consistent with expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa conditions
and
temperature trends, as well as dynamical and statistical model forecast
information. The Northeast also has an elevated chance of above-normal
temperatures (greater than 40 percent) given large positive local SST
anomalies
and expected impacts from La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa.



Conflicting signals in forecast tools support equal chances (EC) of above,
near, and below normal temperatures in the Pacific Northwest eastward to mu=
ch
of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. Uncertainty is also hi=
gh
across the Gulf States, as some dynamical model forecasts depict an area of
EC.
However, a weak tilt toward above-normal temperatures is favored given
anomalously warm Gulf of Mexico SSTs.



Observed cold local SST anomalies around Alaska that are forecasted to pers=
ist
into November support elevated odds for below-normal temperatures for much =
of
southeastern/eastern Alaska westward to the Alaska Peninsula. Additionally,
anomalous upper level ridging off the southern coast of Alaska supports low
level cyclonic flow and colder surface air temperatures over southern Alask=
a.
Dynamical and statistical model guidance as well as expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa impacts
also support below-normal temperatures over Alaska in November. Though the =
MJO
is forecasted to deteriorate, the potential for suppressed convection over =
the
maritime continent and enhanced convection over the eastern Pacific during
week
2 supports cold temperatures over much of interior Alaska.



The November precipitation outlook is influenced by background La Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDa
impacts,
statistical forecast tools, and dynamical model guidance. Elevated odds of
below-normal total precipitation amounts are depicted for the southern tier=
 of
the U.S., with strongest odds over the south central U.S. Below-normal tota=
l
precipitation in this region is consistent with expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDa impacts and
precipitation trends, and supported by dynamical and statistical model
guidance. Expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impact to the gulf states and F=
lorida is typically
enhanced odds for below-normal precipitation, but disagreement in dynamical
and
statistical models warranted a shift of the strongest probability to the
south-central U.S.



Dynamical model guidance and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impacts support eleva=
ted odds of
above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest stretching into Montan=
a
and parts of Wyoming. Though there is evidence of elevated odds for
above-normal precipitation across the entire region, the strongest
probabilities are shifted eastward due to high precipitation climatology in
the
more western parts of the region. A second region of mildly elevated odds o=
f
above-normal precipitation stretches from the Great Lakes into the northern
parts of New England, supported by expected La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa impact=
s, statistical, and
most dynamical model guidance. Given the potential for lake effect
precipitation as we enter into the colder parts of the year, slightly eleva=
ted
odds for above-normal precipitation are depicted over the Great Lakes.



Weak probabilities of below-normal precipitation are forecasted for
southeastern Alaska, shifting to weak probabilities of above-normal
precipitation in northern Alaska, consistent with statistical model guidanc=
e.
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa and long term precipitation trends support this pa=
ttern, as well as
potential for more open water north of Alaska in early winter.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Oct 21 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

The November-December-January 2021-2022 temperature outlook depicts elevate=
d
odds for above-normal seasonal mean temperatures along the southern half of
the
U.S. and for the eastern third of the nation. The greatest likelihood for
warmer than normal temperatures is located across the Southwest and souther=
n
Plains. Below-normal temperatures are most likely for Southeast Alaska and =
a
small area in the Pacific Northwest.



For precipitation, above-normal seasonal precipitation amounts are favored =
for
the west coast of Alaska, the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies and porti=
ons
of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and Northeast. Drier-than-normal conditions
are
most likely for south-central Alaska and along the southern tier of the U.S=
.
from California eastward to the southern Plains and Southeast.



La Nina conditions have emerged in the Pacific Ocean and its influence
contributed substantially to the temperature and precipitation outlooks
through
the winter months into the early Spring 2022.





BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictio=
ns/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!p6EDBG4MbEXlGlyrNw7MMRVTzOG1Dsj9iLbFrmYD=
4DTMnmj6yfZ-kQzmmRpM_-ZA9C9d6qdc$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

La Nina conditions have developed in the Pacific Ocean as indicated by both
ocean and atmospheric indicators and a La Nina Advisory was issued earlier =
in
October. Equatorial Pacific ocean surface temperature departures are negati=
ve
from just west of the Date Line to the South American coast with anomalies
generally ranging from -0.5 to -1.0 degrees C. The latest weekly Nino3.4
region
SST departure was -0.8 degrees C. A strong reservoir of colder than normal
water is observed via ocean temperatures along the equator from 160 W to 10=
0 W
at a depth ranging from just below the surface to 200 meters depth from the
eastern to the central Pacific respectively. The negative ocean temperature
anomalies in this area surpasses -6.0 degrees C at their current peak. This
colder than average water supports further surface cooling over time as we
enter the winter months in the equatorial Pacific. The integrated oceanic h=
eat
content continues to become more negative and is currently at levels more
negative than this time last year.



The atmospheric state is displaying characteristics consistent with La Nina
with enhanced convection on average in proximity to Indonesia and suppresse=
d
convection near the Date Line. Trade winds are enhanced and upper-level
westerly wind anomalies are present in the central Pacific.



Below-normal sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are present in surrounding wat=
ers
around Alaska and cooling of near and offshore waters off the U.S. West coa=
st
are now evident - consistent with the typical La Nina atmospheric response.
Above-normal SSTs are evident along the eastern seaboard, especially off th=
e
Northeast coast.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The CPC Nino3.4 SST consolidation forecast shows a continued decrease in
anomalous SST through DJF 2021-2022 to near -1.0 degrees C with the
statistical
model components indicating less negative anomalous values while the dynami=
cal
model sources such as those from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble
(NMME)
suggest a stronger event. The NMME ensemble mean shows a decrease to near -=
1.5
degrees C over the same period. The latter, however, is influenced by some
members that appear to be cold outliers as compared to the majority of the
other guidance. The CPC / IRI official ENSO outlook depicts high probabilit=
ies
(greater than 90% through NDJ 2021-2022 and greater than 75% through JFM 20=
22)
for La Nina, with these odds decreasing to near 60% in FMA 2022.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Potential typical impacts known to be associated with La Nina winters are
utilized in preparation of the outlook via common techniques that include
composite analysis (including consecutive La Nina events) and regressions
anchored to Nino3.4 SST in both diagnostic and prognostic terms. La Nina
impacts were considered through the MAM 2022 forecast lead. Dynamical model
guidance from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model ensemble systems ar=
e
also used through MAM 2022. In addition, objective, skill-based consolidati=
on
tools contribute to the outlook and include the ENSO/OCN and complete suite
statistical/dynamical tool combinations. Statistical guidance such as the
global SST based CA, CBaM guidance and long term temperature and precipitat=
ion
trends played a role in many of the outlook seasons. Coastal SSTs also are
considered especially at the early leads.



PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - NDJ 2021 TO NDJ 2022

TEMPERATURE

The NDJ 2021-2022 temperature outlook favors above-normal temperatures for =
the
southern half of the U.S. and also for the eastern third of the CONUS with
below-normal temperatures most likely for a small area in the Pacific
Northwest
and for Southeast Alaska. The expectation of La Nina conditions and associa=
ted
typical impacts - on average over many events - is the primary driver of th=
e
evolution of the temperature outlooks from NDJ 2021-2022 through the MAM 20=
22
lead as indicated by multiple methods that includes empirical, statistical =
and
dynamical forecast guidance. The dynamical model guidance suite (NMME and C=
3S)
strongly represents an atmospheric response consistent with La Nina across =
the
forecast domain. Moreover, the NMME seems to depict a more robust, amplifie=
d
ENSO forced wave train over the Pacific Ocean and North America as compared=
 to
its forecasts from last month. This is not overly surprising given the most
recent NMME SST forecasts of potentially more anomalously negative equatori=
al
Pacific SSTs.



The temperature guidance is colder in areas such as Alaska (considerably so=
),
western Canada and in the western CONUS, bleeding eastward into the norther=
n
Plains. Model probabilities for above-normal temperatures in areas such as =
the
southeast, mid-South, mid-Atlantic and Northeast are greater than that
depicted
last month. The official outlooks over time increase coverage of below-norm=
al
temperatures for the Pacific Northwest eastward to the northern High Plains=
 in
DJF 2021-2022 and JFM 2022 and relax this area northward (less coverage and
lower probabilities) in FMA and MAM 2022. A forecast for colder conditions =
for
areas along the central U.S. West coast and the Alaska domain is indicated
from
the previous set of seasonal outlooks released in September.



The greatest odds for above-normal temperatures slowly shifts from the
Southwest and southern Plains in NDJ 2021-2022 to the Southeast and lower
eastern seaboard during JFM 2022 and then along the Gulf coast and Texas in
FMA
and MAM 2022. La Nina events are often characterized by high subseasonal
variability especially from the north-central CONUS to the Northeast as the=
se
areas are strongly impacted by variations in the AO/NAO and potential
stratospheric influences (typically more likely during the second half of
winters) - all of which can not be very difficult to reliably predict at th=
ese
lead times. Consequently, the coverage of Equal-Chances (EC) increases in t=
he
these areas in FMA and MAM 2022.



The remaining set of temperature outlooks remain generally the same from th=
e
September release and are based on the ENSO/OCN and other consolidation
forecast tools for which long term temperature trends contribute significan=
tly
at times in various regions.

PRECIPITATION

For the NDJ 2021-2022 precipitation outlook, above-normal seasonal
precipitation amounts are most likely for the west coast of Alaska, the
Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies and portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley an=
d
Northeast. Above-normal Great Lakes surface temperatures with the potential
for
enhanced lake effect precipitation, as compared to climatology, played some
role in the outlook. Drier-than-normal conditions are most likely for
south-central Alaska and along the southern tier of the U.S. from Californi=
a
eastward to the southern Plains and Southeast. Similar to that described ab=
ove
for temperature, the evolution of the precipitation outlooks through MAM 20=
22
are derived from the typical observed impacts during La Nina winters - on
average over many events - and available dynamical model guidance.



In utilizing composite analysis for second year La Nina winters, one area t=
o
note is that for the Far West and West coast, a drier signal is indicated t=
han
when utilizing information from all La Nina winters. Although the sample si=
ze
is low, this adds to normally high uncertainty in this region and so any ti=
lt
in probabilities from normal odds are low with considerable area highlighte=
d
with EC.



The remaining set of outlooks are primarily based on the forecast
consolidation
of statistical guidance and long term precipitation trends.

1115 AM CDT Thu Oct 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Morning observations and
recent hi-res guidance continue to suggest low potential for fire
weather concerns outside of isolated pockets in the immediate lee of
the southern Rockies in east-central New Mexico. See the previous
discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 10/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1147 PM CDT Wed Oct 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough in the upper Midwest will continue east today.
Broad cyclonic flow will develop through the period across much of
the eastern third of the CONUS. Within the intermountain region,
upper-level ridging will remain while an amplified upper trough
moves toward the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, a cold front
will move toward the east coast. Slower frontal progression will
occur in the southern Plains and Southeast. While areas of dry
conditions are expected from the southern Great Basin into the
Southwest, light winds and broad areas of poorly receptive fuels
will keep fire weather concerns low.

1257 PM CDT Thu Oct 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Latest fuel guidance
continues to show poor to modest fuel dryness across much of the
southern Great Basin, which will negate fire weather concerns
despite areas of elevated wind/RH conditions.

..Moore.. 10/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1150 PM CDT Wed Oct 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging across the central CONUS will lose some
amplitude on Friday. Cyclonic flow will increase to the east and
west of the upper ridge. At the surface, a cold front will move into
the central Great Basin by the end of the period. A slightly
better-defined surface lee trough in the Plains will allow some
breezy conditions to develop along with increased moisture. While
dry and windy conditions are likely ahead of the cold front in the
southern Great Basin, poorly receptive fuels will keep fire concerns
low. A narrow zone of dry westerly winds in eastern New Mexico may
develop to the west of better low-level moisture. However, winds
still appear likely to remain at or below 15 mph and peak for a
short duration.

vXfEIaL83Om$

FOR FRIDAY OCTOBER 29 - THURSDAY NOVEMBER 04: Multiple dynamical models
continue to advertise anomalous 500-hPa troughing overspreading much of the
northeastern Pacific, as a series of storm systems forecast for this region
are
likely to bring copious amounts of precipitation, high winds, and high
elevation snow to many parts of the West Coast during week-1. However, thes=
e
hazard threats look to diminish during week-2, as both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles favor much of the anomalous troughing to retrograde and gradually
weaken throughout the course of the period. The 0z GEFS is a bit sluggish w=
ith
this pattern transition by the outset of the period, in part due to its
absence
of anomalous mid-level ridging over the southwestern and central CONUS, whi=
ch
is predominantly featured in the ECMWF and keeps much of the negative mid-
level
height departures mostly offshore early in week-2. Better model agreement i=
n
the height pattern is evident east of the Mississippi Valley, as both the G=
EFS
and ECMWF ensembles favor anomalous troughing where surface low formation a=
nd
frontal activity, tied to the mid-level feature, is anticipated to bring
above-normal, and possibly heavy precipitation to portions of the eastern
seaboard early in the period.



Deterministic solutions have come into better agreement depicting a deepeni=
ng
surface low tracking across the northeastern CONUS late next week. Heavy
precipitation is possible along the accompanying frontal boundary as there =
are
better signs for strong moisture advection from the Atlantic in the latest
guidance. The raw ECMWF ensemble shows at least a 40% chance of 3-day
accumulations exceeding one inch early in the period over portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, where there is agreement in the reforecast tool=
s
indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile
and one inch over the region. Given the good guidance agreement, a slight r=
isk
of heavy precipitation is posted from Oct 29 to 30 for this region. Strong
pressure gradients in the guidance also favor the potential for sustained h=
igh
winds along many coastal areas in the highlighted region.



The Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) analysis tool suggests much of the
enhanced onshore flow to weaken across the West during week-2. The highest =
IVT
probabilities are now favored during the week-1 period, though this tool
features a secondary signal predicted by both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
which may support another period of increased precipitation over the
northwestern CONUS by the beginning of November. Reforecast tools show a cl=
ear
reduction in the potential for heavy precipitation compared to previous
guidance, but both maintain at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile over the Pacific Northwest and parts of north=
ern
California throughout week-2. However, precipitation amounts from the raw
ensemble guidance and probabilistic tools are much less supportive of total=
s
exceeding hazard thresholds, resulting in the removal of the slight risk of
heavy precipitation in today's outlook across the region. Although localize=
d
flooding cannot be ruled out, particularly for burn scarred areas of the We=
st,
the continued above-normal precipitation is expected to benefit many
drought-stricken areas and help replenish water resources throughout the We=
st.
Cooler than normal temperatures are also likely over the northwestern CONUS=
,
although nighttime temperatures are not expected to reach hazard thresholds
during the period.



With anomalous mid-level troughing favored over the higher latitudes of Nor=
th
America, one or more surface cyclones are favored to form over the Gulf of
Alaska during the period. Yesterday's deterministic guidance favored a
particularly potent surface low developing in the Gulf of Alaska, raising
concerns for high gap winds across the Alaska Panhandle, although the lates=
t
guidance has since backed off of this potential, resulting in the removal o=
f a
slight risk of high winds in the outlook. For precipitation, the ECMWF
reforecast tool shows increased chances for 3-day precipitation accumulatio=
ns
exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches across the southern Mainland and
into the Panhandle. Although the GEFS reforecast tool is less supportive of
this heavy precipitation potential, the 0z and 6z GFS favor heavy snowfall
accumulations with daily amounts exceeding 24 inches across the higher
elevations through the middle of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of he=
avy
snow is issued from Oct 29 to Nov 2 for the Chugach and Kenai Mountains.
Should
the wet and cold pattern continue over Alaska, the potential for heavy snow
may
also extend over locations closer to sea level in the upcoming days.

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat over the Midwest...


...Overview...

A quite active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association
with an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple
rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well
inland across the Intermountain West and Rockies late this weekend
into early next week. Systems will eject eastward across the
Plains and then the Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic,
continuing a rainfall threat in tandem. This will result in an
increasingly wetter eastern half of the Lower 48 next week, but
amid relatively mild temperatures for the end of October.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The larger scale longwave pattern evolution remains rather steady
over the past few cycles, but embedded system
propagation/track/depth has not. Lead system into the West will
start as a powerful/deep cyclone well offshore that will move into
southwestern British Columbia. Multi-day trend has been a bit
farther north with the upper trough and surface low in the ECMWF
guidance (ensembles) while the GFS and GEFS were farther south.
Consensus including the UKMET and Canadian lied toward the
southern side but waves of low pressure along the front could
disrupt the movement of the parent low. Regardless, strong cold
front will move into the West and sink southeastward as another
system moves into the Pac NW. Upper pattern will then transition
to a bit more amplitude and possibly form a transient Rex Block
over the Northeast and western Atlantic as a coastal system forms.
Uncertainty increases quite a bit east of 90W midweek next week
and relied mostly on the ensemble means to round out the period
next Wed-Thu. Regardless, consensus shows more ridging into the
West and the trough axis into the Mississippi Valley.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy lead front across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic then western Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest Sunday to the Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday
with possible coastal low development. Proximity to the coast will
influence how much rainfall will occur over the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
(Atmospheric River) shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest
across California. Several inches of rain are possible over the
multi-day period, particularly across favored windward terrain
which may result in some instances of runoff issues and/or
flooding. Burn scars will also be especially vulnerable. Heavy
snows are likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and
especially Sierra, with multiple feet possible at the highest
elevations. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday into Monday
as the core of the upper trough moves inland along with the
surface cold front. Strong winds are also possible for the coast
and inland along mountain ridges. Some of this moisture is
expected to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern
Rockies with significant snowfall for some of these areas as shown
in the WPC Winter Weather Outlook linked below. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern, albeit farther
north, with periods with enhanced precipitation chances going into
the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal but
will moderate by the middle of next week. These may challenge
daily record cool max values over parts of California early next
week with highs only in the 60s.

The larger scale longwave pattern evolution remains rather steady
over the past few cycles, but embedded system
propagation/track/depth has not. Lead system into the West will
start as a powerful/deep cyclone well offshore that will move into
southwestern British Columbia. Multi-day trend has been a bit
farther north with the upper trough and surface low in the ECMWF
guidance (ensembles) while the GFS and GEFS were farther south.
Consensus including the UKMET and Canadian lied toward the
southern side but waves of low pressure along the front could
disrupt the movement of the parent low. Regardless, strong cold
front will move into the West and sink southeastward as another
system moves into the Pac NW. Upper pattern will then transition
to a bit more amplitude and possibly form a transient Rex Block
over the Northeast and western Atlantic as a coastal system forms.
Uncertainty increases quite a bit east of 90W midweek next week
and relied mostly on the ensemble means to round out the period
next Wed-Thu. Regardless, consensus shows more ridging into the
West and the trough axis into the Mississippi Valley.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy lead front across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic then western Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest Sunday to the Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday
with possible coastal low development. Proximity to the coast will
influence how much rainfall will occur over the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
(Atmospheric River) shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest
across California. Several inches of rain are possible over the
multi-day period, particularly across favored windward terrain
which may result in some instances of runoff issues and/or
flooding. Burn scars will also be especially vulnerable. Heavy
snows are likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and
especially Sierra, with multiple feet possible at the highest
elevations. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday into Monday
as the core of the upper trough moves inland along with the
surface cold front. Strong winds are also possible for the coast
and inland along mountain ridges. Some of this moisture is
expected to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern
Rockies with significant snowfall for some of these areas as shown
in the WPC Winter Weather Outlook linked below. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern, albeit farther
north, with periods with enhanced precipitation chances going into
the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal but
will moderate by the middle of next week. These may challenge
daily record cool max values over parts of California early next
week with highs only in the 60s.

...Back to back Pacific storms to bring heavy rain and gusty winds
to the Pacific Northwest...

...Severe thunderstorms possible along a cold front moving through
the Appalachians today and Eastern Seaboard tomorrow...

...Moderate to heavy rain and severe thunderstorms expected in the
Central Plains Saturday in association with a developing low
pressure system...

...Above normal temperatures will continue in the Central and
Southern Plains; more seasonal temperatures to return to the
Intermountain West and East Coast by week's end; cooler than
average in the Midwest and along the West Coast...

A series of Pacific storms will move onshore over northern
California and the Pacific Northwest during the latter half of the
work week, bringing some much needed rain to the regions. The
first, which is currently spinning offshore with an intense
central pressure of 951 mb, is forecast to move inland later
today, bringing heavy rain and gusty winds to portions of northern
California and southern Oregon. Combined with the effects of
upslope flow, ample moisture within this system in the form of a
moderately strong Atmospheric River will allow for high rain rates
and an additional 3 to 4 inches of rain to fall over the area.
While a welcome sight in light of the ongoing drought, periods of
heavy rainfall could be cause for concern, especially in the
mountainous areas of northern California riddled with burn scars.
Given the potential for rapid runoff and debris flows in these
sensitive areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of northern California and
far southwest Oregon through Friday morning. Flash Flood Watches
are also in effect in portions of the northern Sierra Nevada. In
addition to the rain some isolated heavy snowfall will be
possible, primarily in mountain ranges above 8000 ft including the
Cascades, Olympics, and northern Sierra Nevada. As the storm
system pushes inland moderate rain and high elevation snow will
spread to the Intermountain West and the Northern/Central Rockies
on Friday. On Saturday a second Pacific system will move onshore,
bringing another round of rainfall over already sensitive and
saturated soils. Given the fact that most of the rain is forecast
to fall over areas that are also covered in burn scars, the
Weather Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of Excessive
Rainfall for portions of northern California and southwest Oregon
to account for the risk of additional rapid run off and debris
flows.

Further east, a deepening low pressure system is moving through
southeastern Canada, with its trailing cold front passing through
the Appalachian Mountains and the Southern Plains. Showers and
thunderstorms will remain primarily focused around the cold front
as it progresses east and moves offshore late Friday night.
Rainfall rates and totals are expected to be relatively moderate
with this system, however, the risk for the development of severe
thunderstorms will persist through Friday morning. The areas at
greatest risk for severe weather overnight include the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Central/Southern Appalachians, where a
Marginal Risk has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center to
account for the possible development of isolated strong to
damaging wind gusts. Another Marginal Risk area has also been put
in place over west Texas, where any storms that form may pose a
hail and strong/gusty wind threat through the early evening. On
Friday the severe weather potential will move east with the
progression of the cold front into eastern North Carolina, where a
Marginal Risk area has been introduced where thunderstorms could
produce locally strong damaging wind gusts.

On Saturday a developing low pressure system is forecast to bring
showers and thunderstorms to the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley ahead of a lifting warm front. Though rainfall
rates and totals are not expected to pose any threats at this
time, some of the thunderstorms that develop over the region may
become severe and produce large hail Saturday night. As such, the
Storm Prediction Center has introduced a Marginal Risk for Severe
Thunderstorms over portions of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, and
Missouri effective Saturday morning.

Temperatures will generally remain near or above normal in the
south-central part of the country during the short range period.
As cold air is ushered in behind the Canadian low modest
temperature drops will be felt from the Upper Midwest to the
Northeast. The most extreme anomalies are expected in the Upper
Midwest and Ohio Valley on Friday, where daily highs are forecast
to drop into the low to mid 50s, around 10 degrees below normal.
As for the West Coast, persistent cloud cover from the series of
systems moving onshore will generally keep the region 10 to 15
degrees cooler than average for this time of year. However, in
areas of higher elevation such as the northern Sierra Nevada,
temperature departures are expected to be more extreme, sitting 20
to 25 degrees below normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu October 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 27 - 31 2021

Most dynamical models today have come into agreement on major circulation
features over the North American region. The most obvious change is the
continuing trend of deepening the negative 500-hPa height anomalies in the
eastern CONUS, especially in the 00Z European and Canadian ensemble runs. T=
his
results from a strong mid-level storm system dropping out of Canada toward =
the
southeastern CONUS, spawning a strong surface storm in the eastern CONUS, w=
ith
secondary development near or off the Atlantic Seaboard possible. Meanwhile=
,
the long-lived ridge in northeastern North America with positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies centered in eastern Canada should persist, with some gradual
weakening and an eastward drift likely, while the trough amplifies to its
south
over the eastern CONUS. Farther west, a moderate to strong mid-level trough
remains across Alaska with its axis extending southward toward the western
CONUS, but all models have lowered the depth of the largest negative 500-hP=
a
height anomalies in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and pulled the eastward
extent of the trough westward, leaving only the Pacific Northwest with
negative
500-hPa anomalies. This induces a larger, more amplified area of ridging in
the
southwest CONUS, which loosely connects with the persistent downstream ridg=
e
dominating northeastern North America.

With less amplified troughing and associated negative height anomalies over
the
northwestern CONUS, models generally dialed back the heavy precipitation
potential in the Northwest, but above-normal amounts are still favored.
Below-normal precipitation is expected in concert with the ridging over the
southwestern CONUS, extending northeastward toward the positive 500-hPa hei=
ght
anomaly over eastern Canada. In the East, the digging and amplifying mid-le=
vel
trough brings enhanced chances for above-normal precipitation to the Eastea=
rn
Seaboard. The models differ on the timing and location details of the
deepening
eastern CONUS trough, the developing surface storm system, and the potentia=
l
for secondary coastal storm development, so nothing more specific can be
determined at this time. This developing system lessens the likelihood for
above-normal temperatures in the Southeast after the first day or two of th=
e
period, leaving only a slightly enhanced likelihood of above-normal
temperatures there for the 6-10-day period as a whole. With an amplifying
500-hPa ridge in the Southwest extending toward the ridging in northeastern
North America, a broad area with enhanced chances for above-normal conditio=
ns
extends across much of the country from the Southwest to the Northeast, whi=
le
a
small area of below-normal temperatures covers the northwestern CONUS in
association with the offshore mid-level trough. With the axis of this troug=
h
extending north-to-south through Alaska, most of the state should average
cooler than normal, with the best chances for the Aleutians due to
northwesterly to northerly prevailing surface winds. Dry weather is favored=
 in
western Alaska to the west of the mean trough axis while enhanced chances f=
or
surplus precipitation extend across south-central and southeastern parts of
the
state in conjunction with an active storm track to the east of the mid-leve=
l
trough axis.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 25% of Today's GFS

15% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0=

Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, giv=
en
overall good model agreement, offset by higher amplitude troughing depicted=
 in
the East later in the period compared to yesterday.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 29 - NOV 04, 2021

Dynamical model guidance is similar to yesterday in regards to the mean wee=
k-2
500-hPa height pattern, keeping a moderately amplified pattern across North
America. Weak ridging is forecast across the interior western and central
CONUS
as the amplified troughing continues to retreat over the Northeast Pacific.
Most models indicate negative 500-hPa height anomalies across the eastern h=
alf
of the CONUS, primarily from the strong troughing predicted over the region
initially as the storm complex slowly lifts away from the eastern CONUS dur=
ing
the period. As with the 610-day period, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 5=
00-hPa manual height blend
depicts near or slightly below normal heights in the Northwest, with larger
anomalies displaced farther to the west. Near to above normal heights are
indicated for the Southwest including most of California, the Rockies, and
Great Plains, extending toward the anomalous mid-level ridge in eastern
Canada.

The odds for heavy precipitation in the Northwest have diminished given the
farther-west recent model trends for the trough off the West Coast.
Above-normal temperatures are favored from the Southwest to the Northeast a=
s
in
the 6-10-day period, but the trend toward lower 500-hPa heights in the
Southeast leaves them out of the area where near-normal is favored.

With the Northeast Pacific trough pulling farther west, models show less
abundant precipitation in the northwest CONUS for week-2, though enhanced
chances for above-normal totals remain. Also, the troughing centered farthe=
r
west leaves only part of western Washington with enhanced chances for coole=
r
than normal conditions.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 3=
5%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some uncertainty in regards to the amplitude and
configuration of the mid-level flow pattern across the CONUS, especially in
the
East.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat over the Midwest...


...Overview...

A quite active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association
with an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple
rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well
inland across the Intermountain West and Rockies late this weekend
into early next week. Systems will eject eastward across the
Plains and then the Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic,
continuing a rainfall threat in tandem. This will result in an
increasingly wetter eastern half of the Lower 48 next week, but
amid relatively mild temperatures for the end of October.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The larger scale longwave pattern evolution remains rather steady
over the past few cycles, but embedded system
propagation/track/depth has not. Lead system into the West will
start as a powerful/deep cyclone well offshore that will move into
southwestern British Columbia. Multi-day trend has been a bit
farther north with the upper trough and surface low in the ECMWF
guidance (ensembles) while the GFS and GEFS were farther south.
Consensus including the UKMET and Canadian lied toward the
southern side but waves of low pressure along the front could
disrupt the movement of the parent low. Regardless, strong cold
front will move into the West and sink southeastward as another
system moves into the Pac NW. Upper pattern will then transition
to a bit more amplitude and possibly form a transient Rex Block
over the Northeast and western Atlantic as a coastal system forms.
Uncertainty increases quite a bit east of 90W midweek next week
and relied mostly on the ensemble means to round out the period
next Wed-Thu. Regardless, consensus shows more ridging into the
West and the trough axis into the Mississippi Valley.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy lead front across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic then western Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest Sunday to the Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday
with possible coastal low development. Proximity to the coast will
influence how much rainfall will occur over the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
(Atmospheric River) shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest
across California. Several inches of rain are possible over the
multi-day period, particularly across favored windward terrain
which may result in some instances of runoff issues and/or
flooding. Burn scars will also be especially vulnerable. Heavy
snows are likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and
especially Sierra, with multiple feet possible at the highest
elevations. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday into Monday
as the core of the upper trough moves inland along with the
surface cold front. Strong winds are also possible for the coast
and inland along mountain ridges. Some of this moisture is
expected to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern
Rockies with significant snowfall for some of these areas as shown
in the WPC Winter Weather Outlook linked below. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern, albeit farther
north, with periods with enhanced precipitation chances going into
the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal but
will moderate by the middle of next week. These may challenge
daily record cool max values over parts of California early next
week with highs only in the 60s.

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...
...Heavy Rainfall Threat over the Midwest...


...Overview...

A quite active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association
with an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple
rounds of impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well
inland across the Intermountain West and Rockies late this weekend
into early next week. Systems will eject eastward across the
Plains and then the Midwest states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic,
continuing a rainfall threat in tandem. This will result in an
increasingly wetter eastern half of the Lower 48 next week, but
amid relatively mild temperatures for the end of October.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The larger scale longwave pattern evolution remains rather steady
over the past few cycles, but embedded system
propagation/track/depth has not. Lead system into the West will
start as a powerful/deep cyclone well offshore that will move into
southwestern British Columbia. Multi-day trend has been a bit
farther north with the upper trough and surface low in the ECMWF
guidance (ensembles) while the GFS and GEFS were farther south.
Consensus including the UKMET and Canadian lied toward the
southern side but waves of low pressure along the front could
disrupt the movement of the parent low. Regardless, strong cold
front will move into the West and sink southeastward as another
system moves into the Pac NW. Upper pattern will then transition
to a bit more amplitude and possibly form a transient Rex Block
over the Northeast and western Atlantic as a coastal system forms.
Uncertainty increases quite a bit east of 90W midweek next week
and relied mostly on the ensemble means to round out the period
next Wed-Thu. Regardless, consensus shows more ridging into the
West and the trough axis into the Mississippi Valley.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy lead front across portions of the
Midwest/Mid-Atlantic then western Atlantic this weekend and into
next week is expected to produce scattered to numerous showers
with the potential for a few convective complexes that offer
potential for locally heavy downpours/runoff issues, especially
over the Midwest Sunday to the Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday
with possible coastal low development. Proximity to the coast will
influence how much rainfall will occur over the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true for
Sunday and into Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume
(Atmospheric River) shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest
across California. Several inches of rain are possible over the
multi-day period, particularly across favored windward terrain
which may result in some instances of runoff issues and/or
flooding. Burn scars will also be especially vulnerable. Heavy
snows are likely for the higher elevations of the Cascades and
especially Sierra, with multiple feet possible at the highest
elevations. Snow levels are expected to lower Sunday into Monday
as the core of the upper trough moves inland along with the
surface cold front. Strong winds are also possible for the coast
and inland along mountain ridges. Some of this moisture is
expected to reach the Intermountain West and the central/northern
Rockies with significant snowfall for some of these areas as shown
in the WPC Winter Weather Outlook linked below. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern, albeit farther
north, with periods with enhanced precipitation chances going into
the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal but
will moderate by the middle of next week. These may challenge
daily record cool max values over parts of California early next
week with highs only in the 60s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Fri Oct 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will cross the High Plains as an upper trough,
with multiple embedded impulses, traverses the interior West today.
The low-level mass response will be surface low development across
the Great Basin, with modest surface lee troughing occurring across
the southern High Plains. In both locations, at least locally dry
and breezy conditions are expected by afternoon peak heating. Fuel
receptiveness to significant fire spread across portions of the
Great Basin is relatively poor, with no fire weather highlights
introduced for this area. Finer fuels are relatively more receptive
to fire spread (albeit modestly) across the southern High Plains,
but the spatial and temporal extent of Elevated conditions will
likely remain limited, precluding fire weather highlights this
outlook.

...Multi-Day Heavy Rainfall and Mountain Snow Threat over the
West...


...Overview...

An active storm track over the eastern Pacific in association with
an anomalous upper level trough will result in multiple rounds of
impactful weather for the West Coast and extending well inland
across the Intermountain West and Rockies into early next week.
Systems will eject eastward across the Plains and then the Midwest
states and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, continuing a rainfall threat in
tandem. This will result in an increasingly wetter eastern half of
the Lower 48 next week, but amid relatively mild temperatures for
the end of October.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The larger scale longwave pattern evolution remains steady over
the past few model cycles, but embedded system details regarding
timing, track, and depth remain very uncertain, especially at
longer lead times. With the leading system/west coast trough, the
models (with the exception of the UKMET) show good agreement with
depth of the initial deep/powerful cyclone off the British
Columbia coast, but timing and evolution of this trough as it
tracks through the central U.S. become problematic after Wed/day
5. Theres indications in the deterministic guidance that a deep
closed upper low may form over the Great Lakes/Northeast by late
period, but this is a newer theme in the last run or two so
confidence is low. The GFS also is quite a big faster than the
ECMWF/CMC with the associated cold front into the East late week.
The ensemble means seem to show better consistency and agreement.

In the East, problems start right off the bat on day 3-4 with the
GFS much faster with a shortwave/closed low through the Ohio
Valley and eventual possible coastal low development off the
Northeast Coast. The GFS has been consistenty farther north and
faster with this feature. The ECMWF is the farthest south, and the
CMC in the middle, along with the ensemble means. There are also
timing issues with the next trough/system into the West Coast
later next week.

The WPC blend used a majority deterministic guidance (more EC/CMC
than GFS) for days 3-4, with increasing ensemble mean
contributions thereafter to help mitigate the detail differences
which could take a few days to resolve. This maintains fairly good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy front across portions of the Midwest/Mid-Atlantic
then western Atlantic into next week is expected to produce
scattered to numerous showers with the potential for a few
convective complexes that offer potential for locally heavy
downpours/runoff issues, especially across the eastern
Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday-Tuesday with possible coastal low
development. Proximity to the coast will influence how much
rainfall will occur over the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as
temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true into
Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume (Atmospheric River)
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest into California.
Several inches of rain are possible over the multi-day period
(which begins during the short range/this weekend), particularly
across favored windward terrain which may result in some instances
of runoff issues and/or flooding especially over already
vulnerable burn scar areas. Heavy snows are likely for the higher
elevations of the Cascades and especially Sierra, with multiple
feet possible at the highest elevations. Snow levels are expected
to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves
inland along with the surface cold front. Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and inland along mountain ridges. Some of
this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern out West, albeit
farther north this time, with periods with enhanced precipitation
chances going into the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal early
in the week but will moderate by the middle of next week. These
may challenge daily record cool max values over parts of
California early next week with highs only in the 60s.

timing issues with the next trough/system into the West Coast
later next week.

The WPC blend used a majority deterministic guidance (more EC/CMC
than GFS) for days 3-4, with increasing ensemble mean
contributions thereafter to help mitigate the detail differences
which could take a few days to resolve. This maintains fairly good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A lead and wavy front across portions of the Midwest/Mid-Atlantic
then western Atlantic into next week is expected to produce
scattered to numerous showers with the potential for a few
convective complexes that offer potential for locally heavy
downpours/runoff issues, especially across the eastern
Mid-Atlantic/New England Monday-Tuesday with possible coastal low
development. Proximity to the coast will influence how much
rainfall will occur over the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic as
temperatures remain mild.

Meanwhile across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of
enhanced rains are expected from the Pacific Northwest through
especially California that will likely be heavy at times with
breezy conditions as well. This will especially hold true into
Monday as a deep and long fetch moisture plume (Atmospheric River)
shifts southward from the Pacific Northwest into California.
Several inches of rain are possible over the multi-day period
(which begins during the short range/this weekend), particularly
across favored windward terrain which may result in some instances
of runoff issues and/or flooding especially over already
vulnerable burn scar areas. Heavy snows are likely for the higher
elevations of the Cascades and especially Sierra, with multiple
feet possible at the highest elevations. Snow levels are expected
to lower Sunday into Monday as the core of the upper trough moves
inland along with the surface cold front. Strong winds are also
possible for the coast and inland along mountain ridges. Some of
this moisture is expected to reach the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies with significant snowfall. The main
associated cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward
across the east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to
present an emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus
with an influx of Gulf moisture. An additional upstream Pacific
system is forecast to maintain the active pattern out West, albeit
farther north this time, with periods with enhanced precipitation
chances going into the Pacific Northwest well into next week.

In terms of temperature highlights, it will feel more like late
September across much of the central and southern Plains as the
upper level ridge remains in place across this region. High
temperatures are forecast to be 10-15 degrees above normal ahead
of the cold front and possibly near record highs over parts of
Texas. Cooler than normal temperatures are forecast for much of
the West, influenced by the upper trough and mainly overcast
skies. High temperatures may be 10-20+ degrees below normal early
in the week but will moderate by the middle of next week. These
may challenge daily record cool max values over parts of
California early next week with highs only in the 60s.

...Synopsis...
The first in a series of mid-level troughs will impinge on the
central CONUS tomorrow, with a surface low expected to develop and
intensify across the central/southern Plains. Downslope/gradient
southwesterly surface flow will encourage dry and breezy conditions
across the southern High Plains, where multiple preceding days of
dry conditions will support modest priming of the finer (mainly
grass-based) fuels. Up to 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds will coincide with 15-20% RH by afternoon peak heating,
supporting some grass-fire potential and warranting the introduction
of Elevated highlights.

...A trio of Pacific storm systems to produce copious amounts of
rain and mountain snow in the Northwest and California this
weekend...

...Severe storms possible in parts of the Southeast; Moderate to
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms expected in the Central Plains
Saturday in association with a developing low pressure system...

...Above normal temperatures persist in the Central and Southern
Plains; more seasonal temperatures to return to the Intermountain
West and Northeast; cooler than average in the Midwest and along
the West Coast...

The first in a barrage of Pacific cyclones is making for a wet,
dreary, and in some cases gusty start to the day in the Pacific
Northwest. Some locations containing burn scarred areas, however,
do remain susceptible to potential flash flooding, rapid runoff,
and debris flows. A Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall remains
in place for burn scarred areas of the northern Sierra Nevada
today. The storm will weaken as it tracks further inland today and
reaches the northern Rockies tonight. This allows for areas of
valley rain and mountain snow to transpire with light
accumulations. Precipitation remains a welcome sight for the
drought stricken areas of the Intermountain West and West Coast,
and a second storm system will usher in more beneficial rainfall
to the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. Similar to today's storm,
rainfall rates could be excessive at times and burn scarred areas
could contend with rapid runoff and debris flows. This has led to
the issuance of another Marginal Risk for those at-risk areas of
Northern California and southwest Oregon on Saturday. By Saturday
night, a rapidly intensifying Pacific cyclone directing a powerful
atmospheric river squarely at the West Coast delivers a fire hose
of rich subtropical moisture into California. Snow levels will be
low enough to blanket the Sierra Nevada in heavy snow on Sunday
while prolonged periods of rain soak the coast and valleys of
northern and central California. This atmospheric river is set to
drop heavier rainfall amounts and in a shorter time span, leading
to more flash flooding and debris flow concerns for burn scarred
areas of California. In response, a Slight Risk has been issued
for much of Northern California on Sunday.

Further east, a cold front draped along the East Coast may trigger
additional thunderstorms in parts of the Southeast today. Some
thunderstorms could be severe, especially in eastern North
Carolina. Heavy showers and strong thunderstorms are also possible
out ahead of the front in South Florida. Meanwhile, an organizing
area of low pressure in the Southern Plains will become a focus
for strong-to-severe thunderstorms overnight. By Saturday, an
upper level impulse exiting the Rockies will provide a boost in
the development of the Southern Plains frontal system and in doing
so, generating a larger swath of showers and thunderstorms in the
Middle Mississippi Valley. The setup is favorable enough for
severe weather that the Storm Prediction Center has issues a
Slight Risk on Saturday for northeast Kansas. By Sunday morning,
widespread showers and thunderstorms will extend from the central
Plains to the Lower Great Lakes.

Temperature regimes will be clearly depicted thanks to a pair of
frontal systems east of the Rockies. Temperatures north of a
quasi-stationary boundary draped from the northern High Plains to
the Ohio Valley will feel more like early November with departures
averaging nearly 10 degrees below normal both Friday and Saturday
in the Midwest. A cold frontal passage in the Northeast and Ohio
Valley prompts the return of seasonally cool conditions for these
regions. To the South, temperatures are considerably warmer with
the warmest anomalies focused in the southern High Plains. Much of
the High Plains can expect temps in the 70s but Saturday's highs
will eclipse 90 degrees along the Rio Grande in South Texas and
widespread 80s in Texas and Oklahoma. The combination of dry and
hot conditions as well as increasingly gusty winds promotes
favorable fire weather conditions Saturday, and thus an Elevated
Risk has been issued in the SPC's Fire Weather Outlook. Along the
West Coast, the persistent onshore flow and unsettled weather
pattern looks to keep temperatures below normal to close out the
week and throughout the weekend. Daily high temperature anomalies
are likely to range between 10 and 20 degrees below normal across
much of California.

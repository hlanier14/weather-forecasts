Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Tue Oct 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR EASTERN COLORADO
INTO FAR WESTERN KANSAS AND THE WESTERN OKLAHOMA/TEXAS PANHANDLES...

The previous forecast remains on track. In addition to sustained
winds of 20-25 mph, gusts to 40-45 mph will be possible in the area
delineating the potential for critical fire-weather conditions.
Localized critical fire-weather conditions are also possible in the
Big Bend region of southwest Texas, where winds could exceed 20 mph
amid RH values that should fall into the low teens/single digits
this afternoon.

..Karstens.. 10/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Tue Oct 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A surface low and associated sharpening dryline across the
central/southern High Plains will gradually progress eastward
through today as a high-amplitude mid-level trough impinges on the
Plains states. Behind the dryline, a narrow but potent corridor of
favorable wildfire-spread conditions is expected to develop during
the afternoon as the boundary layer mixes. Across the entire
central/southern High Plains, finer/grass-based fuels should have
sufficiently cured given multiple days of dry conditions to support
grass-fire spread.

Widespread 15-25 mph sustained southerly surface winds coinciding
with 15-20% RH is likely from far southwest Nebraska southward along
the KS/CO and TX/NM borders, to the international border, delineated
by Elevated highlights. The best chance for 20-25 mph sustained
southerly surface winds overlapping 15% RH (according to the latest
guidance consensus) continues to be far east Colorado/west Kansas
into the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles, where Critical highlights have
been maintained.

Tennessee Valley, and Central to Southern Appalachians early in week-2. The
eastern half of the Corn Belt has yet to have a freeze, but the growing sea=
son
is expected to end next week with subfreezing temperatures probable. On Nov=
 4
and 5, there is an elevated chance of the first freeze of the season to ext=
end
as far south as the Tennessee Valley and Southern Applachians. The model
consensus has backed off on the magnitude of the anomalous cold and its
duration, due to more progressive flow upstream. As a 500-hPa trough
approaches
the West Coast, a moderating trend in temperatures is expected for the
east-central U.S. later in week-2. Therefore, the slight risk of much below
normal temperatures is discontinued after day 11 (Nov 6).



The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean maintains a high amplitude ridge near the Wes=

Coast, while the GFS and ECMWF ensemble means are more progressive and rapi=

Pacific
flow returning to western North America. These diverging model solutions ha=
ve
implications on not only the longevity of anomalous cold across the central
and
eastern U.S., but also the potential for heavy precipitation along the West
Coast. Given the good agreement between the GFS and ECMWF ensemble means,
uncalibrated ECMWF precipitation tools, and increasing chances of an
atmospheric river event, a slight risk of heavy precipitation (more than 2
inches per 24 hours) is posted for the Pacific Northwest and northern
California, beginning on Nov 6. A slight risk of heavy snow (more than a fo=

Mountains.



An amplified 500-hPa trough, extending from the eastern Bering Sea to the
North
Pacific, continues to favor a wet pattern for southern coastal Alaska early=

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO FAR SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO AND WESTERN OKLAHOMA/TEXAS
PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHERN TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Localized critical
fire-weather conditions are also possible across West/southwest
Texas, in a narrow corridor between the two ongoing areas
delineating critical fire-weather potential. Sustained winds in this
region should exceed 20 mph while RH approaches the mid teens
throughout the afternoon. This region will be monitored for possible
expansion/refinement of the critical delineation(s) in future
outlooks.

..Karstens.. 10/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Tue Oct 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
Through tomorrow/Wednesday, a well-defined mid-level trough will
move eastward in tandem with a surface low, with deep-layer, strong
northwesterly flow dominating the southern High Plains. Though a bit
cooler compared to previous days, dry continental air will
overspread the High Plains, where finer/grass-based fuels are
expected to remain receptive to wildfire-spread. The driest air is
expected to be constrained closer to the lee of the Rockies, with
15% RH straddling the Colorado/New Mexico/Texas border(s). East of
the Texas/New Mexico border, the latest guidance consensus depicts
widespread 15-20 mph sustained northwesterly winds. These
aforementioned conditions warrant the introduction of broad Elevated
highlights expanding from the southern High Plains into Deep South
Texas.

At the moment, two areas exist for the potential of more widespread
Critical conditions. The first is along the Texas/New Mexico border,
where some overlap of 20+ mph sustained northwesterly winds and 15%
RH may occur for a few hours during afternoon peak heating. The
second region is the more immediate post-cold frontal regime across
Deep South Texas, where 20-30 mph sustained northwesterly winds
overlapping 10-15% RH is expected.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast Friday into Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone, capable of threatening October low
pressure records for some places in the Ohio Valley, will be
tracking into the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic by the start of the
medium range period on Friday. This will likely bring a period of
active weather across the eastern U.S. for the latter part of this
week and into the weekend. Model guidance over the past few cycles
has generally shown good agreement on the large scale evolution
and track of this system, with some lingering uncertainties for
timing and details. A 00Z/06Z model composite represents consensus
well for this system and maintains good continuity with the
previous forecasts.

Behind this system the large scale flow aloft will trend toward a
strong ridge over western Canada and a mean trough eventually
covering the eastern half of Canada along with the northern lower
48. At the leading edge of the advancing upper trough, a frontal
system reaching the Pacific Northwest by early Friday will reach
the Plains this weekend. The models have recently come into better
agreement with the associated upper-level shortwave as it crosses
the northern tier of the U.S. and the upper trough core deepens
over central Canada. The front should reach the Northeast by early
next week.

Greater uncertainty exists over the eastern Pacific and western
U.S. A compact upper low should track into the
central/north-central West Coast by Saturday but the models are
still in the process of resolving the specifics. Latest GFS runs
have been a bit on the fast and/or south side of the guidance
spread. At least into Saturday the 12Z UKMET/CMC have gravitated
closer to the 00Z ECMWF versus their old 00Z runs that were
farther north. On the other hand the new 12Z ECMWF has adjusted
north of the new UKMET/CMC. The complexities increase by early
next week. Not only will there be lingering issues for the
weakening energy that remains from this upper low, but also
important detail differences for a reinforcing shortwave dropping
into the northern U.S. (some combination of the two possibly
supporting frontal waviness east of the Rockies). There is also
uncertainty over what proportion of eastern Pacific shortwave
energy may ultimately cut through a moderate upper ridge that the
ensemble means build along or inland from the West Coast--which
will play a significant role in the coverage and intensity of any
precipitation over the West. These issues tend to have lower
predictability by 6-7 days out in time, favoring a transition to a
model/ensemble mean blend that provides reasonable continuity
while awaiting more confident trends/clustering.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the Eastern U.S. later
this week into next weekend, bringing widespread moderate to heavy
rain. By Friday, the heaviest rainfall should be impacting much of
the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower Great Lakes, lifting into the
Northeast by Saturday. A sustained Atlantic moisture feed ahead of
the front anchored by the surface low will likely focus a possible
flood/runoff threat across parts of these regions.

The front moving through the Northwest will continue organized
rainfall and mountain snow across parts of the northern
Rockies/Pacific Northwest on Friday, with conditions finally
beginning to dry out by next weekend as upper ridging builds
behind the departing trough. This weekend the moisture should sink
southward into the Great Basin and the central Plains, with some
snow possible during the colder overnight hours even at the lower
elevations of the High Plains. From the weekend into early next
week there is lower confidence with the precise coverage and
intensity of precipitation from the West into the Plains, based on
the uncertainty of important details of flow aloft. Locations from
the southern Plains into the Midwest and Ohio Valley should see
expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy front by
early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but a few pockets of heavier activity could be
possible. Some Pacific moisture may reach the northern half of the
West Coast early next week but again with low confidence in the
details at this time.

For temperatures, much of the Southeast/Central Gulf region should
see highs up to 10-15F below normal beneath the trough extending
south from the upper low tracking into the central Appalachians by
Saturday. Highs should trend back towards normal as the low lifts
into the Northeast. The central U.S. will see a wide variation of
temperatures over the course of the period. First an area of plus
10-15F or so anomalies for highs will drop from the northern
Plains/central High Plains into the southern High Plains and then
far southern Texas Friday-Sunday. This warmth will be replaced by
an expanding area of below normal readings--initially over Montana
on Saturday and then reaching at least as far as the central
Plains and Midwest by early next week, aided by advancing surface
high pressure. Areas from the northern High Plains through the
south-central Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi Valley
should see one or more days with highs 5-15F below climatological
values for this time of year. Anomalies for min temperatures
should be less extreme but could still be noteworthy for producing
the first freeze in some areas from the central Plains into the
Midwest around next Tuesday.

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain early in the period. As time
progresses, a de-amplification of the overall pattern is noted, as well as =
an
increase in model uncertainty. The ensemble means from today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF,
Canadian,
and GEFS depict a pair of anomalous troughs over the Bering Sea and over th=
e
North Pacific off the coast of western North America. An amplified pattern =
is
depicted downstream across the higher latitudes with ridges forecast over
western Canada and south of Greenland, while anomalous troughing is predict=
ed
from eastern Canada southward to the Great Lakes and Northeast. Generally
low-amplitude flow is depicted across the southern tier of the CONUS. As ti=
me
progresses, a strong trough or closed mid-level low is forecast to progress
from the Bering Sea to near or over southwestern Mainland Alaska. In respon=
se,
model solutions maintain a moderately amplified flow pattern downstream wit=
h
ridging predicted across western North America from Canada southward to the
northern Rockies. Uncertainty is high farther to the south as the ECMWF
ensemble mean predicts a full latitude ridge across much of the western CON=
US
while the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means forecast split-flow, allowing fo=
r a
trough to develop over the southwestern CONUS, undercutting the high latitu=
de
ridge forecast over western Canada. Cyclonic flow is generally forecast to
persist downstream across the eastern CONUS, with some de-amplification not=
ed
by the end of the period, particularly in the GEFS ensemble mean solutions.
There is greater support among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs determinis=
tic runs of the GFS and
ECMWF
of a split-flow pattern across western North America. Thus, the GEFS soluti=
on
was given more weight in the manual 500-hPa height blend today, relative to
yesterday.

With strong ridging forecast over western Canada, downstream troughing is
likely to usher in below normal temperatures for most of the CONUS east of =
the
Rockies. However, above normal temperatures are favored for parts of easter=
n
New England to the east of the predicted mean trough axis. Ridging across m=
uch
of western North America leads to increased chances of near to above normal
temperatures west of the Rockies. Above normal temperatures are likely for
most
of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to mild, southerly flow expected
ahead
of mean surface low pressure forecast near southwestern Alaska. Near to bel=
ow
normal temperatures are favored for the Aleutians behind the predicted surf=
ace
low.

An active pattern is likely for much of southern Alaska as strong surface l=
ow
pressure is generally forecast near the Alaska Peninsula. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the southern half of the state extendi=
ng
southward to the Pacific Northwest and parts of northern California. Surfac=
e
high pressure is expected to dominate farther to the east, leading to
increased
odds of below normal precipitation for most of the north-central CONUS as w=
ell
as parts of the Southeast. However, above normal precipitation is favored f=
or
parts of New England ahead of the mean trough axis forecast over eastern No=
rth
America. Increased return-flow moisture is also possible for the Southern
Plains, leading to a slight tilt toward above normal precipitation.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
increased model uncertainty later in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 03 - 09 2021

Early in the week-2 period, the ECMWF, Canadian, and GEFS ensemble means
maintain a moderately amplified pattern with anomalous troughing in the Eas=
t
and strong ridging over western Canada and parts of the northwest CONUS. As
time progresses, the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means forecast significant
de-amplification of the overall pattern across the CONUS and model differen=
ces
are very large in the handling of this potential pattern transition. These
differences are highlighted by the 0z Canadian, which maintains significant=
ly
more amplification of the overall pattern relative to its GEFS and ECMWF
counterparts. Agreement is better across Alaska, where the ensemble mean
solutions forecast persistence of cyclonic flow across most of the state.
However, models vary greatly on how far south associated troughing will
progress along the west coast of North America with time. The ECMWF ensembl=
e
mean is the most amplified in developing a trough along most of the west co=
ast
by the end of week-2 while the Canadian maintains fairly strong ridging wit=
h
the GEFS falling somewhere in between. The week-2 manual 500-hPa height ble=
nd
represents a compromise of the various ensemble mean solutions with the
greatest weights given to the ECMWF and GEFS solutions, based primarily on
historical skill.

Troughing forecast over the eastern CONUS favors near to below normal
temperatures for most of the eastern half of the country. Conversely, ridgi=
ng
predicted over western North America leads to increased odds of above norma=
l
temperatures across the western half of the CONUS. Above normal temperature=
s
are the most likely outcome for most of central and eastern Mainland Alaska=
,
ahead of a trough predicted near the west coast of the Mainland. Near to be=
low
normal temperatures are favored for most of the western third of the Mainla=
nd
and the Aleutians, near and behind the predicted trough axis.

An active pattern is likely to persist for much of southeastern Alaska as
enhanced southerly flow ahead of a predicted trough favors above normal
precipitation. Below normal precipitation is slightly favored near and behi=
nd
the trough axis, for parts of the western Mainland. The mean Pacific storm
track is generally forecast to shift southward with time, particularly in t=
he
ECMWF-based solutions, leading to increased probabilities of above normal
precipitation across the northwestern CONUS. Surface high pressure is likel=
y
farther to the east, leading to a tilt toward below normal precipitation fr=
om
the Northern Plains southeastward to the Appalachians. The potential for
return
flow moisture from the Gulf of Mexico favors a slight elevation in above
normal
precipitation probabilities across parts of the south-central CONUS. Above
normal precipitation is also favored for northern New England, ahead of a m=
ean
trough forecast over eastern North America. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation are slightly enhanced for parts of the Florida Peninsula, nea=

intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...The second phase of a nor'easter expected to bring high winds
and heavy rain to coastal New England tonight into Wednesday...

...An anomalous low pressure system expected to trigger severe
weather over the Plains on Wednesday, and stormy conditions across
the South, Southeast, and the Midwest on Thursday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest and Rockies
through midweek...

An active weather pattern will bring rainy to stormy conditions
across many parts of the country during the next couple of days.
First of all, a complex low pressure system that brought heavy
rain near and around the New York City area this morning is
forecast to intensify rapidly as it rotates back toward the
southern New England coast tonight.  This second phase of the
nor'easter is expected to pack quite a punch of very strong winds
together with bands of heavy rain as they rotate around the
cyclone center and push onshore tonight.  Winds gusting to
hurricane force is possible later tonight near Cape Cod as the
center of the nor'easter edges closer.  All of southern New
England westward to the New York City/northern New Jersey will be
under the threat of flash flooding through tonight into early
Wednesday.  The cyclone center is forecast to begin moving back
out to sea later on Wednesday with winds and rain gradually
diminishing Wednesday night into early Thursday.

Meanwhile, another energetic low pressure system is developing
over the High Plains.  This system will first ingest moisture and
unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico and will likely trigger
rounds of severe thunderstorms across the central and southern
Plains ahead of a vigorous cold front and dry line later tonight
into Wednesday.  By Wednesday night, the threat of severe weather
will shift into the Deep South and down near the Gulf Coast as an
anomalously large and deep low pressure system continues to
develop in the mid-section of the country.  An axis of moderate to
heavy rain is also expected to extend north of the system across
the Mid-MS Valley into the Midwest.

Meanwhile, a series of low pressure systems will continue this
seasonal wet pattern for the Pacific Northwest over the next
several days. Low elevation rain and high elevation heavy snow
will impact much of the coastal Pacific Northwest and Cascades
respectfully. A few inches of rain are likely for the low
elevations while 1-2 feet of snow is likely across much of the
highest peaks of the northern Cascades. Lighter snow amounts are
expected over much of the high Rocky Mountain peaks. High
temperatures will drop significantly today as high pressure builds
over the West on the backside of the severe weather system over
the Plains. Highs are expected to drop down to 15-25 degrees below
average for much of the Great Basin and California. Seasonal
temperatures will return to the West on Wednesday.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast Friday into Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An anomalously deep cyclone, capable of threatening October low
pressure records for some places in the Ohio Valley, will be
tracking into the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic by the start of the
medium range period on Friday. This will likely bring a period of
active weather across the eastern U.S. for the latter part of this
week and into the weekend. Model guidance over the past few cycles
has generally shown good agreement on the large scale evolution
and track of this system, with some lingering uncertainties for
timing and details. A 00Z/06Z model composite represents consensus
well for this system and maintains good continuity with the
previous forecasts.

Behind this system the large scale flow aloft will trend toward a
strong ridge over western Canada and a mean trough eventually
covering the eastern half of Canada along with the northern lower
48. At the leading edge of the advancing upper trough, a frontal
system reaching the Pacific Northwest by early Friday will reach
the Plains this weekend. The models have recently come into better
agreement with the associated upper-level shortwave as it crosses
the northern tier of the U.S. and the upper trough core deepens
over central Canada. The front should reach the Northeast by early
next week.

Greater uncertainty exists over the eastern Pacific and western
U.S. A compact upper low should track into the
central/north-central West Coast by Saturday but the models are
still in the process of resolving the specifics. Latest GFS runs
have been a bit on the fast and/or south side of the guidance
spread. At least into Saturday the 12Z UKMET/CMC have gravitated
closer to the 00Z ECMWF versus their old 00Z runs that were
farther north. On the other hand the new 12Z ECMWF has adjusted
north of the new UKMET/CMC. The complexities increase by early
next week. Not only will there be lingering issues for the
weakening energy that remains from this upper low, but also
important detail differences for a reinforcing shortwave dropping
into the northern U.S. (some combination of the two possibly
supporting frontal waviness east of the Rockies). There is also
uncertainty over what proportion of eastern Pacific shortwave
energy may ultimately cut through a moderate upper ridge that the
ensemble means build along or inland from the West Coast--which
will play a significant role in the coverage and intensity of any
precipitation over the West. These issues tend to have lower
predictability by 6-7 days out in time, favoring a transition to a
model/ensemble mean blend that provides reasonable continuity
while awaiting more confident trends/clustering.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
the deep low pressure system working across the Eastern U.S. later
this week into next weekend, bringing widespread moderate to heavy
rain. By Friday, the heaviest rainfall should be impacting much of
the Mid-Atlantic and into the lower Great Lakes, lifting into the
Northeast by Saturday. A sustained Atlantic moisture feed ahead of
the front anchored by the surface low will likely focus a possible
flood/runoff threat across parts of these regions.

The front moving through the Northwest will continue organized
rainfall and mountain snow across parts of the northern
Rockies/Pacific Northwest on Friday, with conditions finally
beginning to dry out by next weekend as upper ridging builds
behind the departing trough. This weekend the moisture should sink
southward into the Great Basin and the central Plains, with some
snow possible during the colder overnight hours even at the lower
elevations of the High Plains. From the weekend into early next
week there is lower confidence with the precise coverage and
intensity of precipitation from the West into the Plains, based on
the uncertainty of important details of flow aloft. Locations from
the southern Plains into the Midwest and Ohio Valley should see
expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy front by
early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but a few pockets of heavier activity could be
possible. Some Pacific moisture may reach the northern half of the
West Coast early next week but again with low confidence in the
details at this time.

For temperatures, much of the Southeast/Central Gulf region should
see highs up to 10-15F below normal beneath the trough extending
south from the upper low tracking into the central Appalachians by
Saturday. Highs should trend back towards normal as the low lifts
into the Northeast. The central U.S. will see a wide variation of
temperatures over the course of the period. First an area of plus
10-15F or so anomalies for highs will drop from the northern
Plains/central High Plains into the southern High Plains and then
far southern Texas Friday-Sunday. This warmth will be replaced by
an expanding area of below normal readings--initially over Montana
on Saturday and then reaching at least as far as the central
Plains and Midwest by early next week, aided by advancing surface
high pressure. Areas from the northern High Plains through the
south-central Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi Valley
should see one or more days with highs 5-15F below climatological
values for this time of year. Anomalies for min temperatures
should be less extreme but could still be noteworthy for producing
the first freeze in some areas from the central Plains into the
Midwest around next Tuesday.

...The second phase of a nor'easter expected to bring high winds
and heavy rain to coastal New England tonight into Wednesday...

...An anomalous low pressure system expected to trigger severe
weather over the Plains on Wednesday, and stormy conditions across
the South, Southeast, and the Midwest on Thursday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest and Rockies
through midweek...

An active weather pattern will bring rainy to stormy conditions
across many parts of the country during the next couple of days.
First of all, a complex low pressure system that brought heavy
rain near and around the New York City area this morning is
forecast to intensify rapidly as it rotates back toward the
southern New England coast tonight.  This second phase of the
nor'easter is expected to pack quite a punch of very strong winds
together with bands of heavy rain as they rotate around the
cyclone center and push onshore tonight.  Winds gusting to
hurricane force is possible later tonight near Cape Cod as the
center of the nor'easter edges closer.  All of southern New
England westward to the New York City/northern New Jersey will be
under the threat of flash flooding and coastal flooding through
tonight into early Wednesday.  The cyclone center is forecast to
begin moving back out to sea later on Wednesday with winds and
rain gradually tapering off Wednesday night into early Thursday
over much of New England.

Meanwhile, another energetic low pressure system is developing
over the High Plains.  This system will first ingest moisture and
unstable air from the Gulf of Mexico to trigger rounds of severe
thunderstorms across the central and southern Plains ahead of a
vigorous cold front and a dry line later tonight into Wednesday.
By Wednesday night, the threat of severe weather will shift into
the Deep South and down near the Gulf Coast as an anomalously
large and deep low pressure system continues to develop in the
mid-section of the country.  An axis of moderate to heavy rain is
also expected to extend north of the system across the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Midwest.  By Thursday evening,
widespread moderate to locally heavy rain is forecast to engulf
the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the lower Great Lakes, as well as
into the Mid-Atlantic region.  Some locations in the lower to
mid-Mississippi Valley could see the barometer dipping to record
low levels for the month of October.

For the Pacific Northwest, a series of low pressure systems moving
onshore will prolong the wet pattern for several more days.  Low
elevation rain and high elevation heavy snow will continue to
impact much of the coastal Pacific Northwest and Cascades
respectfully.  A couple inches of rain are possible for the low
elevations while 1-2 feet of snow is likely across much of the
highest peaks of the northern Cascades.  Lighter snow amounts are
expected over much of the high Rocky Mountain peaks.  Cool
conditions across much of the West today will return to seasonal
levels on Wednesday behind the developing cyclone over the central
U.S.  Meanwhile, dry conditions will prevail over the Southwest.

0135 AM CDT Wed Oct 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO INTO
THE NORTHWEST TEXAS PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough and associated surface low will progress towards the
southern Mississippi Valley, with deep-layer dry northwesterly flow
prevailing across the Southern Plains today. Strong northwesterly
surface winds will support favorable conditions for grass-fire
spread to areas that have not experienced heavy rainfall
accumulations yesterday. Specifically, fire weather highlights have
been removed across portions of the Texas Rolling Plains/Big Country
given the passage of a mature squall line over fuels that were
modestly receptive at best. However, areas farther west (i.e. far
eastern New Mexico) and southward into Deep South Texas have
remained relatively devoid of precipitation accumulations.

Widespread 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid RH
under 20% are expected by afternoon peak heating across far eastern
New Mexico into Deep South Texas, where Elevated highlights have
been maintained. A focused corridor of potentially overlapping 20+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds and 15% RH is likely along
the New Mexico/Texas Panhandle border area, prompting the
continuation of Critical highlights. Similarly, the Critical area
remains in place across Deep South Texas, where 20+ mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds and 15% RH are still expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A deep northwesterly flow regime will persist across the Southern
Plains as an upper trough and surface low slowly progress towards
the Ohio Valley tomorrow/Thursday. Similar to Day 1, Critically dry
and windy conditions will ensue across portions of the Southern
Plains. However, given the passage of heavy rainfall/thunderstorms
previous to Day 1, fuel receptiveness is expected to remain poor
across several locales.

Portions of far western Kansas into the central Texas Panhandle have
not experienced overly heavy rain. Finer fuels are expected to be
receptive enough to support some grass-fire spread, and given 15-25
mph sustained northwesterly winds coinciding with 20% RH, Elevated
highlights have been introduced. Similar to Day 1, 15 mph sustained
northwesterly winds and 20% RH will persist across Deep South Texas,
prompting the introduction of Elevated highlights here as well.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Northeast on Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period starts Saturday with a deep cyclone making
its way through the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast with active
weather likely to accompany. Model guidance over the past few days
has generally shown good agreement on the large scale evolution
and track of this system, with some lingering uncertainties in the
details. A 12Z/18Z model composite represents consensus well for
this system and maintains good continuity with the previous
forecasts.

Behind this system the large scale flow aloft will trend toward a
building ridge over western Canada and a mean trough eventually
covering the eastern half of Canada along with the northern lower
48. At the leading edge of the advancing upper trough, a frontal
system will be pushing into the Plains/Midwest this weekend. The
models have recently come into better agreement with the
associated upper-level shortwave as it crosses the northern tier
of the U.S. and the upper trough core deepens over central Canada.
A reinforcing shortwave will drop into the northern Plains behind
this, which should help to drive the front into the Northeast by
early next week.

The greatest uncertainty exists over the eastern Pacific and
western U.S.. Models continue to show a compact upper low moving
into the central/north-central West Coast by Saturday but the
specifics still need to be worked out. Latest GFS runs have been a
bit on the fast and/or south side of the guidance spread. The
UKMET/CMC have gravitated closer to the more northerly ECMWF.
After Saturday though, there are lingering issues with the
weakening energy that remains from the upper low. There is also
uncertainty over what proportion of eastern Pacific shortwave
energy may ultimately cut through a moderate upper ridge that the
ensemble means build along or inland from the West Coast,
eventually possibly shifting southward into the Great Basin late
period. This evolution will ultimately play a significant role in
the coverage and intensity of any precipitation over the West.
These issues tend to have lower predictability by 6-7 days out in
time, favoring a transition to a model/ensemble mean blend that
provides reasonable continuity while awaiting more confident
trends/clustering.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy rains from the Eastern U.S. cyclone will be continuing
across portions of New England fueled by a sustained Atlantic
moisture feed ahead of the front and anchored by the surface low.
This likely will bring a flood/runoff threat of some kind to parts
of eastern New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday.

The front moving through the Northwest on Saturday may bring some
light rain/mountain snows to parts of the Great Basin/northern
Rockies, expanding into parts of the central Plains by Sunday.
Some snow may be possible during the colder overnight hours even
at the lower elevations of the High Plains. Confidence in the
precise coverage and intensity of rain across these regions though
remains low, based on the uncertainty of important details of flow
aloft. Locations from the southern Plains into the Midwest and
Ohio Valley and eventually the interior northeast should see
expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy front
early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but a few pockets of heavier activity could be
possible. Some Pacific moisture may reach the northern half of the
West Coast early next week but again with low confidence in the
details at this time.

For temperatures, initial below normal daytime highs across the
Southeast should moderate back towards normal behind the departing
upper closed low as it lifts into the Northeast. The south central
U.S. may start warm (+10-15F) on Saturday, but replaced by early
next week by an expanding area of below normal readings--initially
over Montana on Saturday and then reaching at least as far as the
central Plains and Midwest by early next week, aided by advancing
surface high pressure. Areas from the northern High Plains through
the south-central Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi
Valley should see one or more days with highs 5-15F below
climatological values for this time of year. Anomalies for min
temperatures should be less extreme but could still be noteworthy
for producing the first freeze in some areas from the central
Plains into the Midwest around next Tuesday.

...Rain and strong winds associated with Nor'easter will begin to
wind down across the Northeast today as system moves out into the
Atlantic...

...Anomalous low pressure system to spark severe weather across
Gulf Coast today and then much of the Southeast on Thursday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest through
Thusday...

The Nor'easter responsible for producing flash flooding and
powerful winds across much of the Northeast will begin to wane in
strength and impact today as the surface low moves out into the
North Atlantic. Additional rainfall amounts will be marginal, but
winds will remain strong until this evening when the surface
pressure gradient is weakens. Wind advisories, high wind warnings
and flood watches remain in effect for parts of southern New
England. Autumn-like temperatures will return to the East Coast
for the next several days in the wake of the departing Nor'easter
as well as the arrival of high pressure over the Ohio Valley and
eventually the Northeast.

Our current significant weather maker is generating rain showers
and thunderstorms across the Great Plains. The low pressure system
responsible for this will spread thunderstorm activity into the
Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast over the next few days. Severe
thunderstorms are likely to form along the primary cold front
moving from the Southern Plains to the Gulf coast through
Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center issued an Enhanced Risk of
Severe Thunderstorms for the Louisiana coast today as well as
Slight Risks for the much of the Gulf and Southeast coasts through
Thursday. Convective line segments capable of generating damaging
winds and brief tornadoes are expected from these storms. This
system will also produce an axis of 1-2 inches of rain, with
locally higher amounts, particularly due to convection, across
much of the Mississippi Valley today. The upper-level pattern will
slow down and deepen into a closed low on Thursday as it directs
moisture from the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic and Central
Appalachians, where an inch of rain is possible with locally
higher amounts. Showers will spread into the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast this weekend as this system occludes and elevates into
the region. Below average high temperatures will filter in the
wake of this system over the Mississippi Valley and Southeast
heading into the weekend.

An approaching low pressure system will bring more wet weather to
the Pacific Northwest late today through Friday. Heavy snow will
impact the northern Cascades today while lower elevations receive
rain showers over the next couple of days. Critical Fire Weather
is forecast for parts of the Southern Plains today and Thursday.
Areas untouched by the ongoing rainfall and severe weather,
eastern New Mexico and south Texas, will be especially susceptible
to fire weather due to dry conditions and high surface wind speeds
on the order of 15-25 mph.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1127 AM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The forecast generally remains on track for much of the Southwest
and southern High Plains, and a few expansions were made based on
recent trends in guidance and surface observations.

...Great Basin...
Recent guidance has trended towards higher probabilities of
widespread elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions
across portions of the Great Basin, and morning observations support
this trend. This idea is also supported by water-vapor imagery,
which shows a dry slot transversing NV into the Four Corners region,
which will support clear skies and strong diurnal heating. The
elevated risk area has been expanded accordingly.

...central High Plains...
To the east across the central High Plains, widespread elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions are expected this
afternoon. However, fuel readiness remains a concern after recent
rainfall over the past 48 hours (per MRMS estimates and morning
CoCoRaHS observations from southwest KS). Despite this factor,
recent observations across east/northeast CO show humidity already
falling to near 20% with winds increasing to around 20 mph.
Additionally, recent ensemble guidance has trended towards higher
probabilities of critical conditions across portions of east-central
CO (roughly along the I-70 corridor). These dry, windy conditions
will help dry somewhat moist finer fuels and support a fire weather
threat for this afternoon. The elevated was expanded to include
areas most likely to see periodic critical conditions and portions
of the CO/WY/NE border region where little to no rainfall has
occurred in recent days.

...Montana...
Broken clouds behind a cold front have allowed RH to fall into the
30-35% range across north-central MT this morning. Some solutions
suggest further RH reductions to near 20% are possible as winds
increase to 20-25 mph behind the front. However, recent light
precipitation and the limited spatial extent of this threat preclude
additional highlights. Across eastern MT, humidity values should
fall to near 20% ahead of the approaching cold front, but winds are
forecast to remain relatively light (10-15 mph) until the cold front
arrives. Transient and localized elevated conditions are possible
along and immediately behind the front.

..Moore.. 04/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1254 AM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will pivot into the Upper Midwest today. To the
west, a shortwave trough will dive southeastward into the eastern
Great Basin and central Rockies. A broad surface low in the upper
Mississippi Valley will tend to fill with time. With moderate flow
across the Divide, a lee trough will develop and merge with the
eastern low. A cold front will move through the Northwest and into
the Great Basin by the end of the period.

...Southeastern Great Basin and Southwest...
The synoptic pattern will favor dry and windy conditions across a
broad swath of the Great Basin and the Southwest. However, a very
diffuse surface pattern in the Plains and a general lack of
upper-level features will generally keep conditions within what is
typical for most locations. Fuels across parts of New Mexico and
Arizona are somewhat drier and elevated conditions are expected to
last longer. 10-15% RH will coincide with 15-20 mph winds during the
afternoon. Locally critical conditions area possible, but most
likely brief. Areas of southern Nevada into western Colorado will
see roughly similar conditions, at least in lower elevations.
However, shortwave ridging aloft will be in place during the morning
and afternoon. The surface gradient and mid-level winds will not
increase until later in the day, suggesting locally elevated to near
critical conditions will also be brief.

...Central High Plains...
Wind along the western flank of the surface cyclone may reach 15-20
mph. Locations in the High Plains will likely be at least moderately
dry with 15-25% RH possible during the afternoon. One mitigating
factor will be the decreasing pressure gradient through the day as
the Plains trough becomes broad and diffuse. Second, light to modest
rainfall has occurred in many locations over the last 24-36 hours.
Surface conditions in these locations Wednesday afternoon were not
overly dry even though windy. With overnight recovery already taking
place, it seems less probable that fine fuels will dry out early
enough Thursday for a significant fire weather threat. That being
said, locally elevated conditions are possible where fuels can dry
out by early afternoon. Southwest Kansas into east-central Colorado
would be the most likely areas for this to occur.

...Higher terrain of Santa Barbara/Ventura Counties...
15-25 mph winds are possible Thursday night into Friday morning with
RH in the 15-20% range. Dead fuels are quite dry in the midst of two
plus weeks of no precipitation. However, live-fuel moisture remains
relatively high. This, coupled with the threat being very limited in
space, precludes highlights. Only locally elevated conditions are
expected.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Forecast confidence remains slightly below average across the
CONUS with some significant uncertainties in the latest model
guidance that result in considerable sensible weather differences,
particularly by days 5-7. A blocky upper level pattern is expected
with ridging amplifying over the eastern Pacific/western U.S.
through the period. Multiple closed lows and general troughing
over the northern Plains and Great Lakes will meander around and
gradually elongate as another closed low asserts itself over the
Intermountain West.

The compact wave coming from the Central Plains to Great Lakes
early in the forecast (Sunday) now has better agreement with some
minor timing issues (the 00Z/06Z GFS was a fast outlier but the
12Z now appears to be in better agreement). The next shortwave
that eventually closes off over the Northern Plains early next
week shows some fair agreement with perhaps the GFS a bit
aggressive/amplified with the deepening 500 mb low. The biggest
model differences lie with the following western U.S. shortwave
that may carve out a longwave trough or closed low over the
Intermountain West toward the end of the period. All of the
deterministic guidance now shows some version of this solution but
with fairly wide latitudinal spread. Finally, blockiness over the
Canadian Maritimes will keep a closed low more or less in place
through the period. The GFS/UKMET is the slowest to eject this out
(compared to the more zonal/progressive ECMWF) but again, there is
more than normal model spread west to east with the position of
this feature. All told, the WPC blend this cycle leaned on the 00Z
ECMWF as its primary component with lesser weight given to the
00Z/06Z GFS given some of the early on timing issues. The
CMC/UKMET appeared useful in the day 3-4 timeframe but by days
5-7, the blend was heavily composed of the ECENS mean and some
GEFS mean.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Moisture and instability along and ahead of the cold front
crossing the East may produce areas of locally heavy rainfall over
parts of Florida while elsewhere from the Great Lakes to
Northeast, light to moderate amounts are forecast. As the front
stalls/washes out across portions of TX and the Gulf Coast,
returning Gulf moisture overrunning that boundary may be the focus
for scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms. The
repeating/multiple days of unsettled weather could lead to some
instances of heavy rain and flooding, particularly over the more
saturated/sensitive areas that have seen much above normal
precipitation the last few weeks. The area of greatest concern is
eastern LA, much of MS and AL. Strong Canadian high pressure
building southward through the Plains and inverted troughing over
the CO Rockies should favor an upslope precipitation event early
to mid next week. The best potential for meaningful snowfall is
over portions of southern WY and the central/northern CO Rockies.


Much of the CONUS including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will
see above normal temperatures on Sunday. The exception is for the
northern Rockies where readings 10-15F below normal are expected.
As troughing sets up over the northern Rockies and northern Plains
later in the period, those below normal temperatures are forecast
to remain in place and gradually spread southward further into the
Plains. Many areas will see readings of 10F to as much as 20F
below normal for highs. Nighttime lows will be mostly near normal
for the CONUS, aside for the eastern U.S. where readings of 10-20F
above normal are forecast Sunday and Monday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is anticipated to bring below normal
temperatures and potentially hazardous cold over many parts of the central =
and
eastern lower 48. A stalled frontal boundary forecast across the southeaste=
rn
lower 48 early in the period supports the potential for heavy rainfall acro=
ss
the Gulf of Mexico coastal states. Mid-level high pressure forecast over
western North America is expected to promote unseasonably warm temperatures
for
the western contiguous U.S., and a moderation of temperatures across much o=
f
Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over much of the central and
eastern CONUS, Fri-Thu, Apr 16-22.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley
and the Southeast, Fri-Sat, Apr 16-17.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY APRIL 11 - THURSDAY APRIL 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!tDPw6u5kr8prPQgrlUI232nuIAdgCx-2SLq4LtcrB1Av8OO9Pe7l_Z8JTTwdq=
FM2VwPYVfCk$

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 16 - THURSDAY APRIL 22: There continues to be relatively g=
ood
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean 500-hPa height anomalies
during week-2, with strong negative height departures over the eastern half=
 of
North America. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means indicate positive mid-leve=
l
height anomalies across the western half of North America, with the ECMWF
anomalies being noticeably higher than the GEFS. As mid-level shortwave
troughing shifts across the eastern CONUS, cold air is anticipated to spill
southward from central Canada into the central CONUS at the beginning of th=
e
period, with the anomalous cold shifting eastward by the middle of the peri=
od.
A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is highlighted over much of
the
central and eastern CONUS for the entire period. This hazard region covers =
a
broad area where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20=
%
chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and be=
low
freezing over the Great Plains and Midwest early in the period, and expandi=
ng
into parts of the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley,
mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and Southeast by the middle of the period, where
temperatures may fall below the lowest 15th percentile and 40 deg F. These
areas further south are included in the risk due to the heightened concern =
for
impacts to vulnerable emerging spring vegetation, which may occur even if
temperatures stay slightly above freezing. Above normal temperatures foreca=
st
in the East during week-1 also favor a northward expansion of spring bloom,
potentially allowing for a greater impact from the shift to colder
temperatures
forecast in week-2 across northern areas. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
depict weaker positive height anomalies across eastern Canada in week-2
compared to yesterday. This is consistent with the NAO trending toward a mo=
re
neutral phase, and would support a moderation of temperatures across the
central CONUS by the end of the period.



Upstream, anomalous ridging continues to be favored by both the GEFS and EC=
MWF
across western North America, which is expected to promote unseasonably war=
m
temperatures for portions of the western CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates greater positive mid-level height departures compared to the GEFS
ensemble mean, similar to yesterday. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools bo=
th
indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 90 to 95 deg F over parts of the Desert Southwest. However,
temperatures are not anticipated to reach triple digits, precluding a much
above normal temperature hazard from being posted at the time. These anomal=
ous
warm temperatures could increase evapotranspiration, which could worsen soi=
l
moisture conditions. This would especially be of concern for areas currentl=
y
experiencing severe drought.



Although there is good agreement between the multi-model ensembles with the
mid-level pattern aloft, there continues to be some differences regarding t=
he
potential for heavy rain between the models across the southern tier of the
CONUS. Similar to yesterday, the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a
20%
chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and on=
e
inch along the Gulf of Mexico Coast and inland across parts of the Southeas=
t.
The GEFS reforecast tool is not as robust with this potential, but its
uncalibrated ensemble guidance shows an increased signal for heavy rain aro=
und
days 8 and 9 across these areas. The development of a stalled frontal bound=
ary
is possible early in the period, ahead of the troughing upstream to the wes=
t,
and both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict mean surface low pressure and
southerly flow across the Gulf of Mexico which support enhanced precipitati=
on
over the southeastern U.S. Thus, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is
maintained for the Gulf of Mexico coastal states for Apr 16 to 17, as
above-normal precipitation across the Southeast is also historically
consistent
with the negative phase of the NAO during April. By the middle of the perio=
d,
the frontal boundary is forecast to move offshore with surface high pressur=
e
building in behind it, ending the threat for heavy precipitation.



Across the Alaska region, a transition from negative to positive mid-level
height departures is anticipated by the beginning of week-2. Although this
pattern change and the accompanying warmer temperatures is likely to help
bring
an end to the cold spell forecast for much of the state during early April,
attention will turn to any anomalous warm pattern that develops following t=
he
predicted cold pattern over Alaska, which may lead to accelerated snowmelt =
and
increase the risk of localized flooding during river ice breakup season. Ba=
sed
on the latest guidance, the greatest likelihood for above-normal temperatur=
es
during week-2 is across the northern Mainland. However, temperatures in
northern Alaska are expected to remain well below freezing during week-2, a=
nd
climatologically, river ice breakup in this region typically begins later i=
n
May.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 14 - 18 2021

There is good agreement among the predicted 500-hPa height and surface mean
sea
level pressure patterns across North America for the 6-10 day period. Model=
s
agree well in predicting positive mid-level height anomalies across much of
Alaska and the northwestern CONUS. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS, associated with a broad me=
an
trough, with heights becoming near-normal along the Gulf Coast.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Mainland Alaska, the Ala=
ska
Panhandle, and western CONUS underneath above-normal 500-hPa heights and
sinking air aloft. Colder air in Canada is also expected to shift southward
into the central CONUS to as far south as Texas, increasing probabilities o=
f
below-normal temperatures across the Great Plains along with the Mississipp=
i
and Ohio Valleys, with the highest probability exceeding 70% over the parts=
 of
the Central and Southern Plains. For parts of the Northeast and Southeast,
above-normal temperatures are favored, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

With mean mid-level troughing and a storm track across the Gulf of Alaska,
above-normal precipitation is favored across much of Mainland Alaska. Below
normal precipitation is favored over much of the West Coast, Great Basin,
Northern Rockies, and eastward across the Northern Plains to the Midwest,
associated with surface high pressure that is expected to dominate through
much
of the period. At the base and ahead of the mean trough over the eastern
CONUS,
above-normal precipitation is favored for the Southern Plains, Gulf Coast, =
and
Eastern Seaboard.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=

0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among models and forecast tools, offset by some disagreement=
 in
the surface and mid-level height fields over Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 16 - 22 2021

The 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America during Week-2
indicates an eastward progression of the pattern from the 6-10 day period.
Today's model solutions agree well with above-normal mid-level heights
predicted across all of Alaska and most of the western CONUS. Over most of =
the
central and eastern CONUS, below-normal 500-hPa heights are favored,
associated
with an amplified mean trough.

Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights over Alaska and predominant southerly
flow over the Alaska Panhandle enhance probabilities of near to above-norma=
l
temperatures over these regions. Above-normal temperatures are favored in t=
he
western third of the CONUS, underneath positive mid-level height anomalies =
and
sinking air aloft. An amplified mean trough over the eastern CONUS and surf=
ace
high pressure on its western periphery favor enhanced odds of below-normal
temperatures from most of the Great Plains to much of the East Coast. Howev=
er,
above-normal temperatures in northern New England are consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

Mean surface low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska favors below-normal
precipitation in its wake over parts of southwestern Alaska and the Panhand=
le.
Near to above normal precipitation is favored for parts of northern Mainlan=
d
Alaska consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Ridging aloft and
above-normal 500-hPa heights favor below-normal precipitation across the
western CONUS, Great Basin, Northern and Central Plains, and eastward to mu=
ch
of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Above-normal precipitation is favored =
for
parts of the Southern High Plains, Southeast and Northeast, consistent with
the
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement in the modeled temperature and precipitation fields across
North
America, offset by some uncertainty in the mid-level height pattern over th=
e
North Pacific and southern Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 PM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE TRANS PECOS REGION OF TEXAS...

...Southern High Plains...
The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed.
Guidance and recent fuel reports from the southern High Plains
continue to suggest that the highest fire weather threat will evolve
over the Trans-Pecos region of southwest Texas with widespread
elevated conditions across the broader southern High Plains region.


...Northern Plains...
To the north, a relatively small elevated risk area is introduced
across parts of western ND and far eastern MT where fuels have been
very dry. The best chance for wetting precipitation over the next 24
hours should remain along and south of the I-94 corridor. Locations
to the north will likely receive little precipitation, and consensus
among guidance suggests reasonable probabilities for sustained
elevated conditions with RH falling to 20-25% amid 15-25 mph winds
by late afternoon.

..Moore.. 04/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move from the central Rockies into
Oklahoma on Friday. An enhanced belt of mid-level winds will also
develop within the southern jet stream across the southwestern U.S.
border. The approaching trough will deepen a surface cyclone in the
southern High Plains. A cold front will move from the Texas
Panhandle into the South Plains by late afternoon.

...Southern High Plains Vicinity...
The presence of the surface low accompanied by moderate mid-level
winds aloft will lead to a relatively broad area elevated fire
weather in New Mexico and western Texas. One of the main challenges
will be the conditions behind the cold front. The typically cool
guidance shows RH increasing behind the front. However, forecast
soundings show clear skies and the strongest cold advection looks to
occur later in the day. With that in mind, the elevated area has
been expanded into the Texas Panhandle as the drier/warmer guidance
seems more reasonable in this case. Eastward extent becomes
questionable as increasing green-up in grasses is evident. Winds of
15-20 mph ahead of the front, and potentially up to 25 mph
immediately post frontal, are possible. RH will range from 5-15%
ahead of the front with 15-20% more likely after its passage.

Critical fire weather is most likely in the Trans-Pecos. This region
has ERCs approaching the 90th percentile along with stronger
mid-level winds associated with the southern jet stream. Here 20-25
mph winds will overlap similarly low RH of 5-10%.

Farther north into southeast Colorado, dry and windy conditions may
occur behind the front; however, there is considerably more
uncertainty as to if these conditions will develop and how long they
will last. No highlights will be added for this region.

...Northern Plains...
Very dry fuels are in place in parts of eastern Montana into western
North Dakota. 15-20 mph winds appear probable during Friday
afternoon. The primary issues here are marginal temperatures and
possible precipitation along the front Friday morning. These
uncertainties preclude highlights.

318 PM EDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 11 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 15 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Forecast confidence remains slightly below average across the
CONUS with some significant uncertainties in the latest model
guidance that result in considerable sensible weather differences,
particularly by days 5-7. A blocky upper level pattern is expected
with ridging amplifying over the eastern Pacific/western U.S.
through the period. Multiple closed lows and general troughing
over the northern Plains and Great Lakes will meander around and
gradually elongate as another closed low asserts itself over the
Intermountain West.

The compact wave coming from the Central Plains to Great Lakes
early in the forecast (Sunday) now has better agreement with some
minor timing issues (the 00Z/06Z GFS was a fast outlier but the
12Z now appears to be in better agreement). The next shortwave
that eventually closes off over the Northern Plains early next
week shows some fair agreement with perhaps the GFS a bit
aggressive/amplified with the deepening 500 mb low. The biggest
model differences lie with the following western U.S. shortwave
that may carve out a longwave trough or closed low over the
Intermountain West toward the end of the period. All of the
deterministic guidance now shows some version of this solution but
with fairly wide latitudinal spread. Finally, blockiness over the
Canadian Maritimes will keep a closed low more or less in place
through the period. The GFS/UKMET is the slowest to eject this out
(compared to the more zonal/progressive ECMWF) but again, there is
more than normal model spread west to east with the position of
this feature. All told, the WPC blend this cycle leaned on the 00Z
ECMWF as its primary component with lesser weight given to the
00Z/06Z GFS given some of the early on timing issues. The
CMC/UKMET appeared useful in the day 3-4 timeframe but by days
5-7, the blend was heavily composed of the ECENS mean and some
GEFS mean.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Moisture and instability along and ahead of the cold front
crossing the East may produce areas of locally heavy rainfall over
parts of Florida while elsewhere from the Great Lakes to
Northeast, light to moderate amounts are forecast. As the front
stalls/washes out across portions of TX and the Gulf Coast,
returning Gulf moisture overrunning that boundary may be the focus
for scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms. The
repeating/multiple days of unsettled weather could lead to some
instances of heavy rain and flooding, particularly over the more
saturated/sensitive areas that have seen much above normal
precipitation the last few weeks. The area of greatest concern is
eastern LA, much of MS and AL. Strong Canadian high pressure
building southward through the Plains and inverted troughing over
the CO Rockies should favor an upslope precipitation event early
to mid next week. The best potential for meaningful snowfall is
over portions of southern WY and the central/northern CO Rockies.


Much of the CONUS including the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will
see above normal temperatures on Sunday. The exception is for the
northern Rockies where readings 10-15F below normal are expected.
As troughing sets up over the northern Rockies and northern Plains
later in the period, those below normal temperatures are forecast
to remain in place and gradually spread southward further into the
Plains. Many areas will see readings of 10F to as much as 20F
below normal for highs. Nighttime lows will be mostly near normal
for the CONUS, aside for the eastern U.S. where readings of 10-20F
above normal are forecast Sunday and Monday.

...Heavy rain/flooding and severe thunderstorms are expected for
the south-central to southeastern U.S. Friday and Saturday...

...Snow is likely in the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains
Friday, with another round in the Northwest by Friday night...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest to Southern High Plains...

A surface low pressure system is forecast to continue to move
slowly to the northeast through the Upper Midwest over the next
couple of days, with rain and some thunderstorms likely for the
Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes region, and Ohio Valley. The
Storm Prediction Center has delineated a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms through tonight for portions of the Ohio Valley for
the threat of high winds. Showers and possibly thunderstorms are
also forecast along a stationary boundary extending southeast
through the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas as well. However, the more
impactful rain and thunderstorms are likely to be farther south
across the Southern Plains and Southeastern U.S., as two frontal
systems meander in the area and Gulf of Mexico moisture increases
Friday and Saturday. On Friday and Friday night, an Enhanced Risk
of severe weather is outlined for the Southern Plains into the
Lower Mississippi Valley for tornado, wind, and hail threats. The
severe weather threat will shift further into the Southeast ahead
of a cold front that will push eastward during the day Saturday,
where a Slight Risk of severe weather is highlighted. Heavy
rainfall is also likely along a stationary front extending into
the Lower Mississippi Valley and ahead of the cold front, with a
Slight Risk of flooding during the day and overnight Friday.

In the northwestern U.S., precipitation is forecast along with
cooler than normal temperatures as a cold front continues to the
southeast through the Central Rockies and eastward into the
northern Plains. Some snow accumulations are possible Friday,
particularly for portions of southwestern Montana and the Black
Hills. Then, precipitation chances increase again late Friday into
Saturday for the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies as another
cold front comes through, with over a half foot of snow possible
for the northern Cascade Mountains.

In the Southwest and High Plains, warm temperatures are forecast
along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values, and this
combination will lead to the potential for continued dangerous
fire weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined
an Elevated Risk of fire danger in and around New Mexico through
tonight. On Friday, there is a Critical Risk outlined for
southwestern Texas, with an Elevated Risk again outlined for
portions of New Mexico and west Texas. There are also widespread
Red Flag Warnings in effect for portions of the Four Corners
states, the Central and Northern High Plains, and Oklahoma.

In general, most of the contiguous U.S. should see above normal
temperatures over the next few days, with the exceptions being the
Northwest as well as northern/central portions of the Plains
behind the cold front pushing east Friday and Saturday. High
temperatures will be particularly warm for portions of the eastern
Great Lakes region and interior Northeast Friday and Saturday,
with highs up to 20 degrees above normal. The Desert Southwest and
southern Texas will experience temperatures in the 90s and nearing
100 degrees over the next few days.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Multiple mid-level shortwave troughs will move eastward across the
central/southern Plains today. A belt of enhanced mid-level westerly
winds will also exist across parts of the Southwest and southern
High Plains. At the surface, a low is forecast to remain over
central TX through the day, with a cold front surging southward
across the central/southern Plains. A dryline will extend southward
from the surface low into south-central TX.

...Southern/Central Rockies and Adjacent High Plains...
Boundary-layer mixing is expected to lead to an increase in
strong/gusty surface winds behind the dryline extending across a
broad swath of NM into west TX by early this afternoon. Sustained
west-northwesterly winds of 20-25 mph appear likely from
northwestern/central NM into far west TX and the Edwards Plateau
region. Stronger gusts of 35-45 mph appear possible, especially in
the higher terrain. Diurnal heating and low-level downslope
warming/drying will easily lead to critically lowered RH values
across a broad portion of NM and west TX. RH values will likely
bottom out in the 5-15% range for several hours this afternoon. The
ongoing critical area has been expanded into parts of
northwestern/central/southeastern NM, where a combination of these
strong/gusty winds, reduced RH values, and dry/receptive fuels
appears likely. Confidence has also increased that the dryline will
extend farther eastward into central TX, and the elevated/critical
areas have likewise been expanded eastward into more of this region.

Strong/gusty northerly winds of 20-30 mph also appear likely today
behind the cold front across parts of the central High Plains, the
OK/TX Panhandles, and western OK. Although fuels may be in some form
of green up across the southern High Plains, these enhanced winds
coupled with reduced RH values of 15-25% may foster enough drying of
fine fuels/grasses to support some threat for large fire spread. The
elevated area has therefore been expanded eastward across these
areas to account for this potential.

...Northern Plains...
Strong northerly winds of 15-25 mph will occur behind a cold front
this afternoon across parts of the northern Plains. Even though
temperatures will be relatively cool, RH values should still drop
into the 15-25% range. Latest data indicates fuels remain very dry
across western ND and vicinity. There is some potential for light,
wetting precipitation early this morning. But, most of this should
be no more than 0.10-0.20 inch, and the strong/gusty winds may still
dry fine fuels enough later today to support fire spread. The
elevated area has been adjusted to account for where consensus of
latest guidance shows the best potential overlap of lowered RH
values and strong/gusty winds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1158 PM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
One upper trough/low should move eastward from the Plains to the mid
MS Valley on Saturday, while another shortwave trough amplifies over
the northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Moderately enhanced
mid-level west-northwesterly flow will remain over portions of the
Southwest and southern High Plains. At the surface, a low should
deepen over the northern High Plains, with lee troughing becoming
established across the central/southern High Plains by Saturday
afternoon.

...Southwest into the Southern Rockies and Adjacent High Plains...
A broad elevated area has been included for parts of eastern AZ into
much of NM and a small part of far west TX for Saturday. Across this
region, sustained winds of at least 15-20 mph appear likely for a
few hours Saturday afternoon. With ample diurnal heating expected
once again, RH should fall into the 7-15% on a fairly widespread
basis. These forecast meteorological conditions coupled with
continued dry to very fuels will likely foster widespread elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions. A portion of western
and southern NM may have slightly better potential for 20+ mph
sustained winds in closer proximity to the stronger mid-level flow.
If current model trends continue, this area may need an upgrade to
critical in a subsequent outlook update.

...Northern/Central High Plains...
A cold front is forecast to move southeastward across the northern
High Plains on Saturday. Strong/gusty post-frontal winds will occur,
and RH values may briefly become lowered immediately behind the
front before temperatures quickly cool. Some potential for briefly
elevated fire weather conditions appears possible across parts of
central/eastern MT, but too much uncertainty exists to introduce an
elevated area just yet. Farther south into WY, strong westerly
downslope low-level flow may develop Saturday afternoon, but there
are differences in model guidance regarding the strength of these
winds and related reduction in RH values. Furthermore, fuels appear
either unreceptive or just marginally receptive. Given this
potentially limiting factor, will defer possible inclusion of an
elevated area.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models days 3-7 (Monday-next Friday). Applied most blend
weighting to the GFS/ECMWF early next week and gradually shifted
focus to the ensemble means into later next week consistent with
slowly building forecast spread in a pattern with good guidance
continuity and predictability. Latest 00 UTC guidance overall
remains in line with this scenario.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplifying upper trough/closed low will dig and settle over a
cooled West next week to the lee of an amplified and slow moving
eastern Pacific to western Canadian upper ridge in a blocky
pattern. Expect some deformation and terrain enhanced
precipitation over the Great Basin, but there is a threat for
protracted periods of heavy snows over the Central Rockies/High
Plains as enhanced by upslope as ample Canadian surface high
pressure digs and settles southward in an airmass inherent with
10-20F below normal temperature anomalies next week.

Meanwhile, complex northern stream closed low energies over the
Upper Midwest/Great Lakes Monday will struggle to consolidate and
shift downstream to off the Mid-Atlantic coast late next week,
blocked by a closed low slowly retrograding from the Canadian
Maritimes. Moderate rains will accompany the path of this system
early next week before losing frontal convergence, with some
wrap-back snows possible for the Upper Midwest. A wavy trailing
front will settle over The South/Gulf of Mexico and offers
potential for some periods with moderate to heavier downpours next
week with a changing multi-day focus over the Southern Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley and the Gulf Coast states/Florida as
uncertain ejecting southern stream impulses locally focus lift and
moisture.

...Stormy and unsettled weather pattern throughout the East to
kickoff the weekend; rounds of severe weather and areas of flash
flooding expected across the Deep South...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest to Southern High Plains...

...Cooler than normal temperatures and mountain snow in the
Northwest, warmer than normal in the Southwest and Northeast...

A large occluded low pressure system in the Midwest continues to
generate spotty areas of showers and thunderstorms from the
northern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic coast this morning. While this
storm system continues to make for cloudy and wet conditions
throughout the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes today,
a new potent upper level disturbance will strengthen as it tracks
into the central Plains this afternoon. This results in a
deepening area of low pressure in the South Central U.S. and an
increasingly favorable environment for intense thunderstorm
activity in the Deep South this afternoon. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Moderate Risk of severe weather today for
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley with an expansive Slight
Risk area that stretches from eastern Texas and Oklahoma to
southern Georgia. Severe storms will be capable of producing
damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes. In addition to the
severe threat later today, there is also a threat for flash
flooding as a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall has been posted
from the Mississippi Delta region to central Alabama. Localized
rainfall totals over 4 inches are possible in these locations.

The severe weather and flash flood threat advances east on
Saturday as an intensifying low pressure system tracks from the
Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes by evening. Slight Risks for
both severe weather and flash flooding have been posted from parts
of the Southeast with portions of the Gulf Coast. Rainfall totals
as high as 4 inches are possible along the central Gulf Coast.
Widespread showers look to accompany the main storm system into
the Great Lakes Saturday afternoon along with breezy conditions.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will also be common from the
Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic coast with a few storms
potentially becoming severe. Hit-or-miss thunderstorms may
continue into the overnight hours Saturday in these areas as the
cold front makes its approach by Sunday morning.

Meanwhile in the Southwest, drier conditions combined with breezy
winds, low relative humidity, and favorable fuels continue to
support Critical Fire Weather conditions from west Texas to
central New Mexico. Elevated Risk areas are also in place
throughout much of the southern High Plains and southern Rockies
today. Fire Weather conditions remain in good standing on Saturday
with an Elevated Risk for parts of southern Arizona, much of New
Mexico, and far western Texas on Saturday. Depending on the timing
of a cold frontal passage, fire weather conditions may remain
favorable for at least some portions of the Southwest by on Sunday.

Elsewhere, a strong Pacific cold front ushers in a below normal
temperatures and a round of valley/coastal rain and mountain snow
to the Northwest late Friday and into Saturday. Saturday daytime
highs throughout the Northwest are forecast to range between 10 to
20 degrees below normal. The injection of subfreezing temperatures
aloft provides mountain ranges such as the Cascades, the
Bitterroots, and northern Rockies a chance for accumulating
snowfall through Saturday evening. The heaviest totals are most
likely to transpire in the Cascades where over a foot of snow is
expected. While the Northwest turns quite cool, above normal
temperatures will engulf the Desert Southwest, the Great Basin,
south Texas, and much of the East Coast. The warmest anomalies
today are anticipated in New England and South Texas with the
latter watching high temperatures soar above the century mark in
the Lower Rio Grande Valley. Temps cool down some in Texas on
Saturday, but high temp anomalies of 20-25 degrees above normal
are expected in the eastern Great Lakes on Saturday. These
anomalies roughly translate to highs approaching 80 degrees
throughout the region Saturday afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CST Thu Dec 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor changes made
to address recent trends in guidance and morning observations. VAD
profiles from across the southern High Plains show 30-40 mph winds
within the lowest 1-2 km above a shallow nocturnal inversion (noted
in 12Z soundings). While visible satellite imagery shows mid/high
cloud cover across west TX that will subdue diurnal warming,
boundary-layer mixing should be sufficient to support gusty winds by
mid/late afternoon. Elevated conditions remain most likely along and
north of I-20 where downslope warming/drying is yielding RH values
in the low 20s and winds are beginning to increase. Confidence in
the coverage and duration of elevated conditions decreases with
northern extent into the OK/TX Panhandles where winds are already
gusting into the 20-30 mph range, but RH values are expected to
remain near or above 25%.

..Moore.. 12/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CST Thu Dec 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel speed maximum embedded in broad west-southwesterly flow
will emerge over the central Rockies today, resulting in the
development of a lee surface low over eastern Colorado. The surface
pressure gradient peripheral to the lee low will gradually tighten
over the southern High Plains through this evening, resulting in
breezy surface winds coincident with downslope-related drying.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions are expected
across portions of the High Plains this afternoon, where downslope
warming/drying will support RH reductions into the teens. At the
same time, breezy west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph and
higher gusts will develop from southeastern New Mexico eastward
across the Texas South Plains and southern Texas Panhandle. While
increasing mid/high-level cloud coverage may limit diurnal heating
to an extent, persistent downsloping should sufficiently offset this
and foster critically low RH for a few hours this afternoon.

139 PM EST Thu Dec 09 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Dec 12 2021 - 12Z Thu Dec 16 2021

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy mountain snow...

...Record warmth likely for much of the central portion of the
Lower 48...


...Overview...

Upper troughing in the East on Sunday will be replaced by
burgeoning upper ridging around midweek as lead and successive
troughing digs through the West. This will promote increasing and
widespread precipitation through much of the West, first along the
coast then progressing southward and eastward, as a modest
atmospheric river event ensues. To the east, strong upper ridging
and southerly flow ahead of the western system will bring in well
above normal temperatures to the central states with daily record
highs likely for many locations. As the western system moves
northeastward through the northern Plains next Wed-Thu, wintry
precipitation may spread across the High Plains along the north
side of the surface low track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the deterministic models showed very
good agreement overall with the pattern evolution of the western
trough and downstream ridge, with expected detail differences. By
next Tue-Thu, upstream flow from the Gulf of Alaska may spawn a
trailing upper trough that could influence where another round of
precipitation may impact the West (lots of north-south spread),
and opted to trend toward the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean
while favoring the ECMWF and Canadian for some added details. The
GFS was on the southern end of the spread but remained a plausible
solution. Trend has been a bit slower by next Wed-Thu with the
trough and resultant area of low pressure moving through the
Plains to the Upper Midwest, dependent on the sharpness of the
upper pattern. This may support a modest area of low pressure with
snow on the northern side of the low but rain for many areas even
into the Great Lakes with mild temperatures.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river will cause
widespread precipitation in the western U.S. through the first
half of next week. Precipitation is forecast for the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, and especially northern California on
Sunday, which will spread southward into southern California
Monday and eastward into the Great Basin and Four Corners states
on Tuesday. Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with
heavy mountain snow especially in the Sierra Nevada and portions
of the Rockies. Coastal rain is expected in California, even down
into Southern CA, and some locally higher rainfall rates may cause
some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar areas.
Appreciable rainfall and mountain snow is also likely into the
Great Basin and central Rockies as the system moves eastward.
Temperatures will be near to somewhat below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-20F below
average for parts of California and Nevada.

Farther east, increasing warmth in the central and eastern U.S.
via strong ridging aloft will lead to temperatures about 10-20F
above average on Sunday but increasing to 20-35F above normal by
Wednesday. Parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley could see highs
into the 70s which will likely break daily records for multiple
locations. Record temperatures will be possible/likely from the
Southern Plains to Great Lakes region ahead of the front, with
temperatures 10-20F above average forecast to expand into the
East. Any widespread precipitation is not likely in the
central/eastern U.S. until next Wednesday as the western system
lifts toward/into Canada.

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy mountain snow...

...Record warmth likely for much of the central portion of the
Lower 48...


...Overview...

Upper troughing in the East on Sunday will be replaced by
burgeoning upper ridging around midweek as lead and successive
troughing digs through the West. This will promote increasing and
widespread precipitation through much of the West, first along the
coast then progressing southward and eastward, as a modest
atmospheric river event ensues. To the east, strong upper ridging
and southerly flow ahead of the western system will bring in well
above normal temperatures to the central states with daily record
highs likely for many locations. As the western system moves
northeastward through the northern Plains next Wed-Thu, wintry
precipitation may spread across the High Plains along the north
side of the surface low track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the deterministic models showed very
good agreement overall with the pattern evolution of the western
trough and downstream ridge, with expected detail differences. By
next Tue-Thu, upstream flow from the Gulf of Alaska may spawn a
trailing upper trough that could influence where another round of
precipitation may impact the West (lots of north-south spread),
and opted to trend toward the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean
while favoring the ECMWF and Canadian for some added details. The
GFS was on the southern end of the spread but remained a plausible
solution. Trend has been a bit slower by next Wed-Thu with the
trough and resultant area of low pressure moving through the
Plains to the Upper Midwest, dependent on the sharpness of the
upper pattern. This may support a modest area of low pressure with
snow on the northern side of the low but rain for many areas even
into the Great Lakes with mild temperatures.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river will cause
widespread precipitation in the western U.S. through the first
half of next week. Precipitation is forecast for the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, and especially northern California on
Sunday, which will spread southward into southern California

into Southern CA, and some locally higher rainfall rates may cause
some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar areas.
Appreciable rainfall and mountain snow is also likely into the
Great Basin and central Rockies as the system moves eastward.
Temperatures will be near to somewhat below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-20F below
average for parts of California and Nevada.

Farther east, increasing warmth in the central and eastern U.S.
via strong ridging aloft will lead to temperatures about 10-20F
above average on Sunday but increasing to 20-35F above normal by
Wednesday. Parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley could see highs

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The ongoing forecast remains on track, though a slight
north/northeastward expansion of the Elevated risk area is noted.
Although latest guidance continues to show low potential for reduced
RH below 25%, many locations across southern KS will see several
hours of 20-30 mph sustained winds. Recent fuel analyses show ERC
values across southern KS are near or above record values for
mid-December, suggesting that a wind-driven fire weather threat is
likely prior to, and immediately following, the cold frontal
passage. Critical conditions remain most likely across parts of
northeast NM and the western TX Panhandle per latest ensemble
probabilities. Deterministic solutions hint that wind gusts upwards
of 40-50 mph are possible within this zone.

..Moore.. 12/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CST Thu Dec 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
As a large-scale trough consolidates and amplifies over the
south-central Rockies, strong deep-layer west-southwesterly flow
will overspread the southern High Plains. As a result, a
low-pressure system will deepen over eastern Colorado and western
Kansas, with a tight surface pressure gradient becoming established
across the southern High Plains. By Friday evening, an attendant
cold front will advance southward across the region, with cool/windy
conditions developing in its wake.

...Southern High Plains...
A few hours of Critical fire-weather conditions are expected across
portions of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle on Friday
afternoon, with Elevated conditions surrounding the Critical area.
In association with the tightening surface pressure gradient, strong
west-southwesterly surface winds of 25-30 mph (with higher gusts)
will develop amid critically low RH. While persistent mid/high-level
clouds will once again limit diurnal RH reductions, the strong
west-southwesterly winds through a deep-layer will generally offset
this. There is some uncertainty regarding how far north enhanced
fire-weather conditions will develop ahead of the approaching cold
front. Therefore, upgrades may eventually be needed for the Oklahoma
Panhandle and portions of southern Kansas in future outlooks as
forecast confidence increases. Highly receptive fuels combined with
a dry antecedent air mass will further exacerbate the
wildfire-spread threat, warranting the Critical delineation.

...Winter storm to produce the first widespread and significant
snow of the season throughout the Intermountain West and Central
Rockies tonight before spreading into the Great Plains and Upper
Midwest on Friday...

...Severe thunderstorms possible for parts of the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio valleys on Friday night...

...Strong storm system to enter the Pacific Northwest on Friday
night...

...Record-breaking warmth to build across the south-central and
eastern United States through Saturday...

Much of the active and potentially hazardous weather over the
Lower 48 during the short term will be associated with a
developing winter storm that is poised to produce a long
stretching swath of heavy snow from the Intermountain West to the
Upper Great Lakes. Light-to-moderate snow is expected to continue
across the Intermountain West this evening. Additionally, cold air
filtering from the north will allow for snowflakes to fall into
the lower elevations of central Nevada and Utah, which could lead
to dicey travel conditions. Snow is also forecast to spread into
the Central Rockies and parts of the central High Plains tonight
as an upper-level trough swings eastward. Snowfall amounts of 1-2
feet are forecast across the Rockies of western Colorado and Utah,
with widespread accumulations of 6-8 inches likely into the
Wyoming Front Range. As the system continues to progress eastward
on Friday, an area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the
Colorado Front Range and race northeast into the Midwest by Friday
night. As a result, a stripe of heavy snow is expected to the
north of the low and across parts of the Central/Northern Plains
and Upper Midwest. Specifically, snowfall amounts greater than 6
inches are likely to have fallen by Saturday morning along the
Nebraska-South Dakota border, northwest Iowa, southern Minnesota,
northern/central Wisconsin, and the U.P. of Michigan. The
combination of heavy snow and gusty winds will lead to hazardous
driving conditions throughout these regions. Given this is the
first widespread and significant snowfall of the season, residents
in these areas are urged to plan ahead and take proper precautions
if venturing out into the storm. Winter Storm Warnings/Watches and
Winter Weather Advisories have been issued.

The other aspect of this early-December winter storm will be
thunderstorm activity along and ahead of a strong cold front
forecast to reach the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley by Friday
evening. It appears likely that thunderstorms will turn severe
from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Lower Ohio Valley into
Friday night. Damaging wind gusts and tornadoes are the main
concern, with large hail possible as well. Most of these
thunderstorms are expected to occur overnight, which can be
particularly dangerous when tornadoes are a possibility. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of
Severe Weather from eastern Arkansas and northwest Mississippi to
far southern Indiana. Some severe cells may produce isolated
occurrences of heavy rain and flash flooding.

Light snow and a wintry mix is likely to swing through parts of
Wisconsin, northern Michigan and the interior Northeast as a warm
front glances across the region tonight through Friday morning. A
few inches of snow may accumulate before the arrival of the
aforementioned winter storm. Otherwise, after a few scattered
mountain snow showers and coastal rain showers today, a strong
cold front is forecast to reach western Washington by Friday
night. Gusty winds and heavy precipitation will be the main
impacts. Snowfall amounts of 2-3 feet are possible in the Cascade
and Olympic Mountains with the highest peaks possibly reaching 4
feet by Saturday night. Heavy snow will also spread into the
Northern Rockies on Saturday as the cold front pushes through the
region. This same cold front will produce much needed rain and
snow for California, where much of the state is under 'extreme' or
'exceptional drought.' This may lead to flash flooding or
landslides over sensitive surfaces.

Meanwhile, winter is nowhere to be found throughout the
south-central U.S. with well above average temperatures set to
expand eastward over the next few days. Highs into the 70s and 80s
are expected in the Southern Plains today and Mid-South by Friday
ahead of the advancing cold front. These warm temperatures will
move into the eastern U.S. by Saturday, where highs in the 70s are
possible as far north as southern New Jersey. Numerous daily high
and low temperature records are likely to break over the next
three days. Critical fire weather risk is in effect on Friday for
parts of northeastern New Mexico and the Texas panhandle due to
strengthening winds and dry conditions brought on by the deepening
winter storm to the north.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu December 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 15 - 19 2021

There is very good agreement among the dynamical models regarding an amplif=
ied
500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain. Anomalous
troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast for much=
 of
western North America, including over much of eastern Alaska and the wester=
n
CONUS. Enhanced ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are favored o=
n
both sides of this trough, across the north-central Pacific, including much=
 of
the Aleutians and the Alaska Peninsula, and over most of the CONUS from the
Plains eastward. The magnitude of the overall pattern is generally forecast=
 to
weaken slightly toward the middle of the period and then potentially re-
amplify
by Day 10. By the end of the period, ridging over southwestern Alaska is
forecast to become a more dominant feature, allowing a trough to reload
downstream across the West Coast of the CONUS.

The anomalous ridging across the eastern and central CONUS supports elevate=
d
probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Central and Southern
Plains
to the East Coast, which is also supported by the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools. The highest probabilities (>90 percent) are located over parts of th=
e
southern Great Plains, the Lower and Middle Mississippi Valley, southern Gr=
eat
Lakes, and the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, corresponding with large positiv=
e
500-hPa height anomalies and enhanced southerly flow. Maximum temperatures
greater than 20 deg F above normal are possible for parts of this region ea=
rly
in the period. Anomalous troughing supports increased chances of below norm=
al
temperatures for much of the western third of the CONUS and over much of
Alaska. However, a moderation in temperatures is favored for western Alaska
later in the period.

Mid-level ridging over the eastern CONUS and associated surface high pressu=
re
favor increased probabilities of below normal precipitation across the East=
ern
Seaboard. The potential for return flow around this surface high pressure
leads
to elevated above normal precipitation probabilities for most of the Plains=
,
Mississippi Valley, and Western Great Lakes. Troughing over the western CON=
US
favors increased probabilities for above normal precipitation over most of =
the
southwestern quadrant of the CONUS. Above normal precipitation is favored f=
or
much of Alaska, as a shortwave trough progresses across the northern Mainla=
nd
during the early and middle portions of the period.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 25% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement regarding an amplified pattern forecast across No=
rth
America, and in the temperature tools, offset slightly by relatively higher
uncertainty in the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 17 - 23 2021

An amplified 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to continue into week-2. Ridg=
ing
is forecast to reload near the Aleutians early and then gain in strength ne=
ar
the western Mainland during the middle and end of the period. In response,
troughing is forecast to re-amplify across the West Coast of the CONUS duri=
ng
the middle and end of week-2. Downstream ridging and positive height anomal=
ies
are favored to persist over the central and eastern CONUS.

The enhanced ridging over the eastern and central CONUS supports an
anomalously
warm pattern from the Southern and Central Plains to the East Coast during =
the
week-2 period. There is a large region with probabilities greater than 80
percent across the Southeast extending northward to parts of the Mid-Atlant=
ic
states. Elevated below normal temperature probabilities continue to be favo=
red
across the much of the western third of the CONUS and southeastern Alaska
associated with troughing. A moderating trend is favored for western and
northern Alaska, as a ridge is forecast to strengthen during the middle and
latter parts of week-2. As this ridge builds, a deepening trough predicted
downstream signals a potential trend toward a colder pattern across the
Panhandle southward along the West Coast of the CONUS and eastward to parts=
 of
the Northern Plains.

Elevated probabilities of near to below normal precipitation remain favored
across the Eastern Seaboard, underneath predicted mean surface high pressur=
e.
Enhanced return flow from the Gulf of Mexico behind this surface high press=
ure
leads to increased probabilities of above normal precipitation across much =
of
the east-central CONUS. Increased troughing over the west generally favors
elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the wester=
n
third of the CONUS. Near to below normal precipitation is slightly favored
across eastern Alaska, as increased surface high pressure is predicted acro=
ss
much of the state in the wake of this trough. However, there are slightly
elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation for parts of southwest=
ern
Alaska, due to the potential for an increased southwesterly component of th=
e
overall flow later in the period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good agreement in the overall large scale 500-hPa and temperature
patterns, offset by relatively lower confidence among the precipitation too=
ls
across much of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy mountain snow...

...Record warmth likely for much of the central portion of the
Lower 48...


...Overview...

Upper troughing in the East on Sunday will be replaced by
burgeoning upper ridging around midweek as lead and successive
troughing digs through the West. This will promote increasing and
widespread precipitation through much of the West, first along the
coast then progressing southward and eastward, as a modest
atmospheric river event ensues. To the east, strong upper ridging
and southerly flow ahead of the western system will bring in well
above normal temperatures to the central states with daily record
highs likely for many locations. As the western system moves
northeastward through the northern Plains next Wed-Thu, wintry
precipitation may spread across the High Plains along the north
side of the surface low track.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the deterministic models showed very
good agreement overall with the pattern evolution of the western
trough and downstream ridge, with expected detail differences. By
next Tue-Thu, upstream flow from the Gulf of Alaska may spawn a
trailing upper trough that could influence where another round of
precipitation may impact the West (lots of north-south spread),
and opted to trend toward the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean
while favoring the ECMWF and Canadian for some added details. The
GFS was on the southern end of the spread but remained a plausible
solution. Trend has been a bit slower by next Wed-Thu with the
trough and resultant area of low pressure moving through the
Plains to the Upper Midwest, dependent on the sharpness of the
upper pattern. This may support a modest area of low pressure with
snow on the northern side of the low but rain for many areas even
into the Great Lakes with mild temperatures.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river will cause
widespread precipitation in the western U.S. through the first
half of next week. Precipitation is forecast for the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, and especially northern California on
Sunday, which will spread southward into southern California
Monday and eastward into the Great Basin and Four Corners states
on Tuesday. Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with
heavy mountain snow especially in the Sierra Nevada and portions
of the Rockies. Coastal rain is expected in California, even down
into Southern CA, and some locally higher rainfall rates may cause
some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar areas.
Appreciable rainfall and mountain snow is also likely into the
Great Basin and central Rockies as the system moves eastward.
Temperatures will be near to somewhat below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-20F below
average for parts of California and Nevada.

Farther east, increasing warmth in the central and eastern U.S.
via strong ridging aloft will lead to temperatures about 10-20F
above average on Sunday but increasing to 20-35F above normal by
Wednesday. Parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley could see highs
into the 70s which will likely break daily records for multiple
locations. Record temperatures will be possible/likely from the
Southern Plains to Great Lakes region ahead of the front, with
temperatures 10-20F above average forecast to expand into the
East. Any widespread precipitation is not likely in the
central/eastern U.S. until next Wednesday as the western system
lifts toward/into Canada.

300 PM EST December 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure continues to be anticipated across =
the
western (eastern) half of the lower 48 during week-2. The orientation of th=
e
mid-level low pressure across the West is less conducive to widespread heav=
y
precipitation than week-1. The heaviest precipitation for week-2 is
anticipated
to be in the form of heavy snow across higher elevation areas of Northern
California and the Sierra Nevada around the middle of week-2. This pattern =
is
also likely to support much below normal temperatures across parts of the W=
est
throughout the week-2 period. Frontal activity across the southeastern
quadrant
of the contiguous U.S. may support enhanced precipitation during the beginn=
ing
to middle of the period. Models show a sharper and stronger ridge in wester=
n
Alaska, which eliminates enhanced chances for much below normal temperature=
s
in
south-central Alaska, but reinforces the expectation of below normal
temperatures across the Panhandle. In addition, there are increased chances
for
high winds in west-central California driven by surface high pressure to th=
e
east. Most models now favor the high pressure center farther north and weak=
er
than yesterday, eliminating enhanced chances for strong Santa Ana winds
further
south.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, Southwest, and California, for the entire week-2
period
(Dec 17-23).

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Northern
High
Plains, Wed-Thu, Dec 22-23.

Slight risk of heavy snow for higher elevation areas in northern California
and
portions of the Sierra Nevada Tue-Thu Dec 21-23.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of coastal central California, Fri-Mon =
Dec
17-20.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Ohio Valley, Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southern Plains, Sat-Mon, Dec 18-=
20.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Alaskan Panhandle,
Mon-Thu, Dec 20-23.

FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 17 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 23: There is relatively good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, indicating a positivel=
y
tilted mid-level trough over the western third of the CONUS at the beginnin=
g
of
week-2, with its axis slightly inland from the Pacific Coast. Today=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models
generally point toward a slightly deeper trough that is less progressive th=
an
indicated yesterday. This  a slight risk of anomalously cold conditions acr=
oss
much of the western CONUS through the entire week-2 period. Chances for muc=
h
below normal temperatures have increased slightly from yesterday given the
potential for a deeper and slower mid-level trough than indicated yesterday=
,
but not enough to support areas with moderate chances of this hazard at thi=
s
time.



The mid-level trough across the West may continue to support surface low
pressure extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the West Coast, but with an
orientation less favorable for heavy precipitation over the West Coast Stat=
es
than week-1. Still, precipitation should be somewhat above normal across th=
e
higher elevations of the southern Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. Temperatu=
res
decrease with elevation, so precipitation on the mountains would likely be =
in
the form of heavy snow. In addition, heavy precipitation is anticipated to
occur while the region has an elevated risk of well below normal temperatur=
es,
so snow may be observed at lower elevations. In concert, these factors just=
ify
a slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of eastern and northe=
rn
California toward the middle of week-2.



There is relatively good model agreement indicating a surface high pressure
over central to western Canada expanding southward toward the end of the
period
into the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies, ushering in a cold air
mass
from Canada. This increases the potential for much below normal temperature=
s
for the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies during the latter half of
week-2 and likely beyond. Models are generally leaning toward the cold air
expanding and  pushing southward late in week-2, but there is not enough mo=
del
consensus to support moderate risk for much below normal temperatures at th=
is
time. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 50% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to 0 degrees F or lower in northeastern Montana and th=
e
northern half of North Dakota.



Models generally keep an area of high surface pressure over the interior We=
st
early week-2, but weaker and centered farther north than yesterday. This
feature may support enhanced downsloping winds across portions of west-cent=
ral
California, but with the feature weaker and/or farther north, there is
insufficient support for posting a hazard for Santa Ana Winds in southweste=
rn
California, west of the coastal mountain ranges.



Multiple model ensemble means and some deterministic solutions continue to
show
the potential for heavy rain along a frontal system moving slowly across th=
e
eastern Great Plains into the interior Southeast during the first half of
week-2. An unusually strong flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is
expected to enhance the frontal rainfall as the frontal system drifts slowl=
y
eastward. This supports  a slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts =
of
the lower Mississippi Valley, interior Southeast, and lower Ohio Valley Dec=
 18
to 20. Drier air is anticipated to push into the region behind the front,
toward the middle of week-2, supporting a transition to a drier pattern.

res
decrease with elevation, so precipitation on the mountains would likely be =
in
the form of heavy snow. In addition, heavy precipitation is anticipated to
occur while the region has an elevated risk of well below normal temperatur=
es,
so snow may be observed at lower elevations. In concert, these factors just=
ify
a slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of eastern and northe=
rn
California toward the middle of week-2.



There is relatively good model agreement indicating a surface high pressure
over central to western Canada expanding southward toward the end of the
period
into the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies, ushering in a cold air
mass
from Canada. This increases the potential for much below normal temperature=
s
for the northern High Plains and adjacent Rockies during the latter half of
week-2 and likely beyond. Models are generally leaning toward the cold air
expanding and  pushing southward late in week-2, but there is not enough mo=
del
consensus to support moderate risk for much below normal temperatures at th=
is
time. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 50% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to 0 degrees F or lower in northeastern Montana and th=
e
northern half of North Dakota.



Models generally keep an area of high surface pressure over the interior We=
st
early week-2, but weaker and centered farther north than yesterday. This
feature may support enhanced downsloping winds across portions of west-cent=
ral
California, but with the feature weaker and/or farther north, there is
insufficient support for posting a hazard for Santa Ana Winds in southweste=
rn
California, west of the coastal mountain ranges.



Multiple model ensemble means and some deterministic solutions continue to
show
the potential for heavy rain along a frontal system moving slowly across th=
e
eastern Great Plains into the interior Southeast during the first half of
week-2. An unusually strong flow of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico is
expected to enhance the frontal rainfall as the frontal system drifts slowl=
y
eastward. This supports  a slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts =
of
the lower Mississippi Valley, interior Southeast, and lower Ohio Valley Dec=
 18
to 20. Drier air is anticipated to push into the region behind the front,
toward the middle of week-2, supporting a transition to a drier pattern.

...Atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast by
early next week to bring a threat of heavy rain and heavy mountain
snow...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. through the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Tuesday-Thursday...


...Overview...

Amplified upper troughing will dig over the West early next week.
This will promote increasing and widespread rains with local
runoff issues and terrain enhancing heavy snows over much of the
West/Rockies, first along the coast then progressing southward and
eastward, as an atmospheric river event ensues. As the main system
lifts northeastward through the Plains next Wed-Thu and spawns
cyclogenesis, wintry precipitation will spread along the north
side of the low track. Downstream, upper ridging will build from
the south-central U.S. to the East. Warm sector record warmth will
include temperatures upwards to 20-35F above normal Tue-Thu
spreading from the central U.S. to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
prior to generally modest rainfall focusiung frontal passage.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through medium
range time scale is much better than normal, bolstering forecast
confidence. The WPC medium range product suite was primailry
derived from a seemingly reasonable and consistent composite blend
of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means days 3-7
along with WPC continuity and the National Blend of Models.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with an atmospheric river will cause widespread
precipitation in the western U.S. early next week. Heaviest
precipitation will spread southward across central and southern
California Mon-Tue and eastward over the Great Basin and Four
Corners states and Rockies through midweek. Enhanced totals are
likely along favored terrain, with heavy mountain snow especially
in the Sierra Nevada and then the central Great Basin and Rockies.
Heavy coastal to interior  rains are expected in California, even
down into Southern CA. Some locally higher rainfall rates may
cause some flooding issues, especially for sensitive burn scar
areas. Temperatures will become below normal in the West
underneath the upper trough, with temperatures 10-15F below
average for parts of California and Nevada.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Middle/Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys through
Saturday morning...

...There will be heavy snow across the Upper Midwest...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys through
Saturday morning...

A rapidly deepening area of low pressure over the Central High
Plains will move northeastward to the Upper Great Lakes by
Saturday morning. The low will move into Southeastern Canada by
Saturday evening, as the associated front moves off the East Coast
overnight Saturday. The storm will produce snow over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies into parts of the Southwest on Friday
morning.  By Friday afternoon, heavy snow will develop over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley,
expanding into parts of the Upper Great lakes by Friday evening.
The heavy snow will wind down over the Upper Great Lakes on
Saturday into Sunday morning.  The snow will result in reduced
visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Moreover, showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead
of the cold front, mainly during the late afternoon into Saturday
morning.  Some of the thunderstorms will be severe.  Therefore,
the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Middle/Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys
through Saturday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Furthermore, there is a 10% or
greater probability of EF2-EF5 over the region. The threat for
severe thunderstorms decreases slightly on Saturday into Sunday
morning. However, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys on
Saturday into Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In the meantime, the thunderstorms will contain areas of heavy
rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee
Valleys through Saturday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that
experience rapid runoff with heavy rain. The Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall will move slightly south and eastward to
include parts of the Southern Appalachians, Ohio/Tennessee Valleys
into the Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday into Sunday morning.
Likewise, the associated heavy rain will create localized areas of
flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with
heavy rain.

Meanwhile, onshore flow will aid in producing rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest on Friday.  On Saturday,
a front will come onshore over the Northwest as rain, heavy at
times, and higher elevation snow moves into Northern California.
As a result, there is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Northwest into Northern California on Saturday into
Sunday morning. The associated heavy rain will create localized
areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid
runoff with heavy rain.  Additionally, heavy snow will develop
over the Cascades through Sunday morning.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
THE NORTHERN TEXAS PANHANDLE...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough will gradually amplify as it advances eastward
from the Intermountain West toward the south-central Rockies today.
Strong deep-layer west-southwesterly flow preceding the trough will
overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains by early
afternoon. As this occurs, a low-pressure system will evolve
eastward from eastern Colorado through Kansas, with an attendant
cold front moving southward across the southern High Plains during
the evening hours. The combination of the strong deep-layer flow,
the tight surface pressure gradient peripheral to the low, and dry
downslope flow will support Critical fire-weather conditions across
portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
A few hours of Critical fire-weather conditions are expected from
far northeastern New Mexico into the northern Texas Panhandle today,
with Elevated conditions surrounding the Critical area. Surface
winds will gradually strengthen in response to the tightening
pressure gradient, with 25-30 mph sustained west-southwesterly winds
expected. In addition, forecast soundings depict very strong
boundary-layer winds, which may mix downward to support surface wind
gusts of 45-55 mph. One limiting factor is the potential for
initially widespread mid/high-level cloud coverage to stunt diurnal
RH reductions. However, present indications are that sufficient
afternoon clearing combined with downslope warming/drying will
result in 15-25 percent RH. Ongoing drought conditions combined with
very dry fuels across the southern High Plains will further
exacerbate the wildfire-spread threat. By the evening timeframe,
surface winds will shift from west-southwesterly to northerly behind
the cold front, with breezy/dry conditions persisting in its wake.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Sun Jul 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

Added an elevated area for portions of the southern Columbia Basin
and the lee of the Oregon Cascades. Dry and breezy conditions are
expected for at least a few hours this evening amid near record dry
fuels.

..Bentley.. 07/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Sun Jul 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone will remain the primary fire weather feature
across the western United States on Sunday. A weak, cyclonic
perturbation rotating around the large anticyclonic mid-level flow
will move north through California before turning east across
northern Nevada and southern Idaho. Farther east, broad mid-level
troughing remain across the eastern half of the country bringing
with it seasonably cool, moist, or both conditions.

... Great Basin into portions of the Northern Rockies...

Thunderstorms are expected to develop on Sunday in association with
strong diurnal heating of a relatively moist atmosphere.
Additionally, the aforementioned trough moving around the broader
ridge will also provide modest large-scale ascent to aid
thunderstorm development. Although precipitable water at or above
one inch in some locations would typically favor wet over dry
thunderstorms, increased flow in the cloud-bearing layer will allow
for sufficiently fast storm motions to limit some thunderstorm's
ability to produce wetting rains. The result should be another day
of a mix between wet and dry thunderstorms.

Extended Forecast Discussion

252 PM EDT Sun Jul 04 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jul 07 2021 - 12Z Sun Jul 11 2021

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
midweek with potential for heavy rainfall and high winds...

...Repeating heavy rain may persist over southern Texas into
Friday as low pressure drifts over the region...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will persist
through the work week and become more amplified next weekend as
the upper ridge over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest strengthens.
A leading shortwave trough pushing east from the northern Great
Lakes Wednesday to eastern Canada/New England Friday will push
along a wavy cold front over the northeastern CONUS through this
time. A trailing Pacific shortwave trough ejecting from the
Washington/Oregon coast around midweek should round the western
ridge and then amplify into the Midwest and vicinity by Saturday,
supporting another area of low pressure and associated frontal
system for the northern half of the country east of the Rockies.
The primary features of interest at lower latitudes will be
Tropical Storm Elsa which should impact Florida and parts of the
Southeast through the middle of the week, and an upper trough/low
drifting southwest from Texas into northern Mexico that may
produce heavy rainfall over southern Texas (and northern Mexico).

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest guidance continues to agree well in principle for the
western ridge and most aspects of northern stream flow, but with
spread for details. This favors a starting point that consists of
an operational model blend early followed by a transition to a
model/mean blend. By the latter half of the period the operational
component made some adjustments due to comparisons with other
guidance. After early day 6 Saturday the forecast phased out the
00Z ECMWF in favor of the prior 12Z run due to Northeast Pacific
upper low progression that has little support from other guidance.
GFS input trended toward a split of 00Z/06Z runs due to a mix of
more/less appealing details depending on the area.

Models are still showing a lot of spread and variability for Elsa.
GFS runs have maintained their weaker depiction at the surface but
still recurve the shortwave energy as in recent days. UKMET/CMC
runs maintain stronger systems at the surface and aloft but have
displayed some timing differences from consensus track forecasts.
After a brief trend toward the majority, the 00Z ECMWF ended up
dissipating the mid level reflection over the Gulf mid-late week.
The new 12Z ECMWF reverted back to a stronger system and consensus
track. This now leaves the GFS in the weak minority. Meanwhile the
blend/ensemble mean approach later in the period provides only
gradual nudges in the forecast while individual solutions vary in
the precise character of the upper trough amplifying into the
Midwest and vicinity. 00Z/06Z models generally trended a bit
weaker than continuity for the core of the trough. Models have
been suggesting there will be an embedded low but with some
variance for location. New 12Z runs seem to be gravitating toward
the Upper Mississippi Valley--near the consensus latitude of
recent cycles--and are a bit slower.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifting southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week will support a repeating rain
threat over that region continuing for Wednesday into Friday,
though the threat for extreme totals has diminished somewhat
compared to forecasts from recent days. However a persistent low
level flow of Gulf moisture will feed into this slow moving
disturbance, maintaining a flooding threat. There is still some
potential for heavy rain and high winds for parts of Florida and
the coastal Southeast from Elsa Wednesday into Thursday--but still
with uncertainty for specifics. Please continue to monitor
products from the National Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa
forecast track information. The wavy front pushing east from the
Midwest/Great Lakes will produce periods of rain that could be
locally moderate/heavy. On Friday tropical moisture from Elsa may
interact with the front as it reaches the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
and produce heavy rainfall. The system forecast to reach the
Midwest/Great Lakes this upcoming weekend could have access to
some Gulf-sourced moisture and result in significant rainfall as
well. Most guidance has been consistent over the past couple days
in signaling the potential for some areas of heavy rain but it
will take more time to resolve the magnitude/location/timing.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least through next weekend as the Great Basin/Southwest upper
ridge restrengthens. The Northwest and northern Great Basin should
see highs 10-15F above normal most days with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day. The only
slight break over northern areas could be Wednesday-Thursday when
a weak frontal passage may nudge highs down to near or slightly
below 10F above normal. Meanwhile the strengthening and westward
expansion of the upper ridge should produce a hotter trend with
time over interior locations of California. The southern High
Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of
the week due to cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper
level disturbance drifting over that region. The Midwest and Great
Lakes will tend to see below normal highs due to rainfall with the
Wednesday-Thursday wavy front and trailing late week/weekend
system. The latter system's cold front may also bring a cooling
trend into the central Plains by next weekend.

252 PM EDT Sun Jul 04 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jul 07 2021 - 12Z Sun Jul 11 2021

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
midweek with potential for heavy rainfall and high winds...

...Repeating heavy rain may persist over southern Texas into
Friday as low pressure drifts over the region...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will persist
through the work week and become more amplified next weekend as
the upper ridge over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest strengthens.
A leading shortwave trough pushing east from the northern Great
Lakes Wednesday to eastern Canada/New England Friday will push
along a wavy cold front over the northeastern CONUS through this
time. A trailing Pacific shortwave trough ejecting from the
Washington/Oregon coast around midweek should round the western
ridge and then amplify into the Midwest and vicinity by Saturday,
supporting another area of low pressure and associated frontal
system for the northern half of the country east of the Rockies.
The primary features of interest at lower latitudes will be
Tropical Storm Elsa which should impact Florida and parts of the
Southeast through the middle of the week, and an upper trough/low
drifting southwest from Texas into northern Mexico that may
produce heavy rainfall over southern Texas (and northern Mexico).

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Latest guidance continues to agree well in principle for the
western ridge and most aspects of northern stream flow, but with
spread for details. This favors a starting point that consists of
an operational model blend early followed by a transition to a
model/mean blend. By the latter half of the period the operational
component made some adjustments due to comparisons with other
guidance. After early day 6 Saturday the forecast phased out the
00Z ECMWF in favor of the prior 12Z run due to Northeast Pacific
upper low progression that has little support from other guidance.
GFS input trended toward a split of 00Z/06Z runs due to a mix of
more/less appealing details depending on the area.

Models are still showing a lot of spread and variability for Elsa.
GFS runs have maintained their weaker depiction at the surface but
still recurve the shortwave energy as in recent days. UKMET/CMC
runs maintain stronger systems at the surface and aloft but have
displayed some timing differences from consensus track forecasts.
After a brief trend toward the majority, the 00Z ECMWF ended up
dissipating the mid level reflection over the Gulf mid-late week.
The new 12Z ECMWF reverted back to a stronger system and consensus
track. This now leaves the GFS in the weak minority. Meanwhile the
blend/ensemble mean approach later in the period provides only
gradual nudges in the forecast while individual solutions vary in
the precise character of the upper trough amplifying into the
Midwest and vicinity. 00Z/06Z models generally trended a bit
weaker than continuity for the core of the trough. Models have
been suggesting there will be an embedded low but with some
variance for location. New 12Z runs seem to be gravitating toward
the Upper Mississippi Valley--near the consensus latitude of
recent cycles--and are a bit slower.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifting southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week will support a repeating rain
threat over that region continuing for Wednesday into Friday,
though the threat for extreme totals has diminished somewhat
compared to forecasts from recent days. However a persistent low
level flow of Gulf moisture will feed into this slow moving
disturbance, maintaining a flooding threat. There is still some
potential for heavy rain and high winds for parts of Florida and
the coastal Southeast from Elsa Wednesday into Thursday--but still
with uncertainty for specifics. Please continue to monitor
products from the National Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa
forecast track information. The wavy front pushing east from the
Midwest/Great Lakes will produce periods of rain that could be
locally moderate/heavy. On Friday tropical moisture from Elsa may
interact with the front as it reaches the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
and produce heavy rainfall. The system forecast to reach the
Midwest/Great Lakes this upcoming weekend could have access to
some Gulf-sourced moisture and result in significant rainfall as
well. Most guidance has been consistent over the past couple days
in signaling the potential for some areas of heavy rain but it
will take more time to resolve the magnitude/location/timing.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least through next weekend as the Great Basin/Southwest upper
ridge restrengthens. The Northwest and northern Great Basin should
see highs 10-15F above normal most days with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day. The only
slight break over northern areas could be Wednesday-Thursday when
a weak frontal passage may nudge highs down to near or slightly
below 10F above normal. Meanwhile the strengthening and westward
expansion of the upper ridge should produce a hotter trend with
time over interior locations of California. The southern High
Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of
the week due to cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper
level disturbance drifting over that region. The Midwest and Great
Lakes will tend to see below normal highs due to rainfall with the
Wednesday-Thursday wavy front and trailing late week/weekend
system. The latter system's cold front may also bring a cooling
trend into the central Plains by next weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun July 04 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Sun Jul 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
The western ridge will build northwestward into the Pacific
Northwest on Monday as the short-wave trough rotating around it
moves east into the northern Plains. As this ridge builds,
increasing mid-level heights and associated subsidence should result
in large-scale drying of the troposphere, in turn suppressing
convection across areas within and around the western Great Basin.
If the mid-level trough is slower to move east into the northern
Plains, isolated dry thunderstorms may be possible across portions
of eastern Idaho, Wyoming and Montana. This area will need to be
monitored in subsequent outlooks for possible dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Regardless of dry thunderstorm potential, increasing mixing heights
and steep lapse-rates associated with the building ridge will
support the potential for plume-dominated fire behavior.

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest and Northern
U.S....

...Locally heavy rain likely along a frontal boundary draped
across the Gulf Coast with monsoon moisture likely across the
Southwest...

...Slight risk for severe thunderstorms for parts of Southern and
Central High Plains through Monday morning and for the Northern
High Plains Monday...

...Tropical Storm Elsa is expected to approach the Keys and South
Florida  by late Monday/early Tuesday morning...

A ridge over most of the western U.S. will keep temperatures well
above seasonal average for early July, with parts of the region
experiencing excessive heat. Daily temperatures will climb into
the 90s and low 100s across the Pacific Northwest and eastward to
the north-central U.S; which may break or tie daily temperature
records. Numerous heat advisories and excessive heat warnings
remain in effect for some locations.

A slow-moving front tracking across the central and north-central
U.S. will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms over the next
few days. Some of these storms may produce moderate to heavy
rainfall in addition to severe weather. Across the southern states
there is a slow-moving frontal boundary that will keep showers and
storms in the forecast from northern Florida to Texas. Moderate to
locally heavy rain and localized flash flooding is possible as is
the threat for severe weather, particularly for parts of the Texas
and Oklahoma panhandles. With scattered to widespread cloudiness
over the southern tier will help maintain near normal or slightly
cooler temperatures for mid-summer. Monsoonal moisture will help
to fuel diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms across parts of
the Southwest with locally heavy rainfall and flash flooding also
a concern.

The National Hurricane Center has Tropical Storm Elsa forecast to
reach the Florida Keys by late Monday and continuing to move
north/northeast along the west side of the state Tuesday. There is
an increasing risk of tropical storm conditions, storm surge, and
heavy rainfall beginning Monday in the Florida Keys and the
southern Florida Peninsula. Tropical storm watches have been
hoisted for parts of the Keys and extreme southwest Florida. This
risk will also spread northward into Florida and parts of the
southeast by Tuesday and beyond the short range period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 AM CDT Mon Jul 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level ridge will remain anchored over the West,
with somewhat marginally enhanced westerly mid-level flow confined
to portions of the Pacific Northwest and the northern Rockies.
Within this zonal flow regime, a mid-level short-wave trough will
move out of the northern Rockies and into the northern Great Plains
throughout the day, while another mid-level short-wave trough will
approach the Pacific Northwest.

Meanwhile, low-level subtropical moisture beneath the ridge will
remain present over much of the central/northern Rockies. Diabatic
heating/mixing processes should lead to the development of isolated
thunderstorms across this region by early afternoon. The combination
of PWAT values at or below 0.75 inches and receptive fuels to
support dry lightning ignitions (despite some recent wetting rains)
appears most conducive over portions of eastern Idaho, far
southwestern Montana, far western Wyoming, and far northern Utah.
Thus, an area delineating isolated dry lightning potential has been
added for this region.

Otherwise, widespread wind/RH concerns remain low for the balance of
the CONUS.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0109 AM CDT Mon Jul 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge positioned over the West will remain
quasi-stationary throughout the period, resulting in light/variable
flow over much of this region. A mid-level short-wave trough will
enter portions of the Pacific Northwest. Mid-level flow along the
southern periphery of this trough, combined with diurnally driven
mixing processed, may result in locally enhanced sustained surface
winds of 10-15 mph over portions of northern California and vicinity
by late afternoon amid a residual dry airmass and RH values
approaching the teens. Thus, locally elevated fire-weather
conditions may be possible for this region. Otherwise, fire-weather
concerns remain low for the balance of the CONUS.

...Elsa is forecast to cross the eastern Carolinas on Thursday and
may result in heavy rainfall near the Carolina Coast...

...Repeating heavy rain may persist over southern Texas into the
weekend as low pressure lingers over northern Mexico...


...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday.
The upper ridge over the Great Basin/Desert Southwest strengthens
in the wake of the ridge riding trough and only intensifies the
ongoing heat wave across The West. An initial shortwave trough
pushing east from the Great Lakes to eastern Canada/New England by
Friday will drag a weak cold front over the northeastern CONUS
through Friday before it lifts back as a warm front ahead of the
ridge riding shortwave trough over the weekend. Tropical Storm
Elsa is forecast to push off the Carolinas on Thursday while an
upper trough/low stalls over northern Mexico that may produce
heavy rainfall over southern Texas (and northern Mexico) into or
through the weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The most recent guidance has come into much better agreement with
the ridge riding shortwave trough that stalls near the Upper
Midwest and with the timing and strength of Elsa. The 18Z and now
00Z GFS are stronger with the resultant low over the Upper Midwest
with a more closed and thus slower system than the ECMWF, but
overall the differences are not great and a dominant deterministic
blend focusing on the GFS and ECMWF was able to be used through
Day 6 when separation of the Upper Midwest low is great enough to
warrant greater inclusion of the ensemble means.  Meanwhile, the
Elsa forecast for Thursday (as it moves across the eastern
Carolinas to the sea) is in remarkable agreement among global
guidance given all the variance over the past several days.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough that stalls over northern Mexico through next
week will support a repeating rain threat over that region
continuing for Thursday and perhaps well into the weekend, though
the threat for extreme totals continues to diminish. However a
persistent low level flow of Gulf moisture will feed into this
slow moving disturbance, maintaining a flooding threat. Heavy rain
would accompany Elsa as it tracks through the eastern Carolinas
Thursday. Please continue to monitor products from the National
Hurricane Center for the latest Elsa forecast track information.
The initial front looks to be a rainmaker for the Northeast
Thursday before the front shifts offshore. Confidence is
increasing for Elsa associated rain on Friday to be off the
Northeastern Seaboard. The ridge riding trough forecast to reach
the Upper Midwest by Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced
moisture and should result in significant rainfall for the far
northern Plains to the northern Great Lakes as the system becomes
blocked/stalls.

The heat wave over a significant portion of the West will continue
at least into next week as the Great Basin/Southwest upper ridge
restrengthens in the wake of the ridge riding trough. The Coast
Ranges across the Great Basin to the northern Rockies should all
see highs 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat across primarily the Great Basin each day with a
slight western shift to California this weekend as the ridge axis
drifts west. The only slight break over the Pacific Northwest
looks to be Thursday when a weak frontal passage nudges highs down
to near or slightly below 10F above normal. Meanwhile the
strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge should
produce a hotter trend with time over interior locations of
California. The southern High Plains/Texas will likely see highs
5-12F below average for most of the week due to cloudiness and
rain from the persistent upper level disturbance drifting over
that region. The Midwest and Great Lakes will see below normal
highs due to rainfall on Thursday and the over the weekend with
the next system. The latter system's cold front may also bring a
cooling trend into the central Plains by next weekend.

...Tropical Storm Elsa is expected to approach Florida on Monday
and parts of the Southeast by Tuesday into Wednesday...

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest with a much
cooler airmass expected after Monday for the Northern Plains...

...Locally heavy rain possible across the Gulf Coast into Texas,
with monsoonal moisture affecting the Southwest...


Tropical Storm Elsa is forecast to begin approaching southern
Florida today with tropical storm conditions and a dangerous storm
surge possible tonight and into Tuesday. Tropical storm conditions
and heavy rainfall should affect northern portions of Florida and
into coastal Georgia and the Carolinas Tuesday night and into
Wednesday and beyond. Heavy rainfall associated with Elsa could
result in isolated flash, urban, and minor river flooding across
Florida and parts of the Southeast. WPC has highlighted much of
the Florida peninsula within a slight risk for excessive rainfall.
For the latest information on Elsa, please refer to the National
Hurricane Center.

Excessive and oppressive heat across the Northwest will continue
through at least the first half of the week where daytime highs
will climb well into the 90s and low 100s. Monday will be slightly
less hot than previous days, but daily record highs will, once
again, be challenged by Tuesday and Wednesday for parts of the
Great Basin and northern California. Heat advisories and excessive
heat warnings remain in effect for some locations.

A slow-moving front tracking across the central and north-central
U.S. will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms over the next
few days. Some of these storms may produce moderate to heavy
rainfall in addition to severe weather. SPC has a small slight
risk for severe thunderstorms across far western South Dakota on
Monday. After one more warmer than average day on Monday, this
frontal boundary will usher in a much cooler airmass Tuesday into
Wednesday from the northern Plains to the Upper Great Lakes where
daytime highs on Tuesday could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal.
In the South, a dissipating frontal boundary will linger along the
Gulf Coast allowing for daily rain and storms in the forecast from
northern Florida to Texas. Moderate to locally heavy rain is
possible. Scattered to widespread cloudiness over the southern
tier will help maintain near or below normal temperatures,
especially across parts of western Texas and New Mexico. In the
Southwest, monsoonal moisture will fuel diurnally driven showers
and thunderstorms across parts of the Southwest with locally heavy
rainfall and flash flooding a concern.

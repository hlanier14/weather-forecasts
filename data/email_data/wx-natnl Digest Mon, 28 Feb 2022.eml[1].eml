Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1029 AM CST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no changes
or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 02/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Sun Feb 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel ridge will build eastward across the central Rockies and
adjacent Plains, while a low-amplitude shortwave trough crosses the
northern Rockies along the northern periphery of the ridge. At the
surface, expansive high pressure will remain centered over the
Intermountain West, while weak lee troughing develops over parts of
the northern and central Plains.

...Central and Southern Plains...
As the midlevel ridge overspreads the region, maximum temperatures
will climb into the upper 50s to near 60 across most of the central
and southern Plains. This will result in widespread minimum
afternoon RH of 10-15 percent, though sustained surface winds should
generally remain below 15 mph where fuels are receptive to
wildfire-spread. The one exception may be over parts of northern KS
and NE, where west-northwesterly surface winds could approach 15 mph
amid 10-15 percent RH. However, these conditions appear too marginal
and localized for Elevated highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
Along the southern periphery of the western CONUS surface high, dry
offshore flow will continue across southern California. Over parts
of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, northeasterly wind gusts of
25-35 mph will overlap 5-15 percent RH during the morning and
afternoon hours. With that said, high live fuel moisture should
generally mitigate the fire-weather threat, though localized
fire-weather concerns will exist where the gusty winds/low RH align
with dead fuels. No highlights will be introduced due to the
localized nature of the threat.

111 PM EST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 2 2022 - 12Z Sun Mar 6 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic guidance is generally in above
average agreement on the large scale pattern through the end of
the week, with the highest level of confidence in the southern
stream and the building upper trough over the Intermountain West
by the weekend.  Initially the GFS/GEFS is a bit stronger with a
shortwave crossing the south-central U.S. for the middle of the
week, but differences at the surface are less noticeable and thus
still comparable to the other guidance.  The  12Z GFS is also more
progressive with an ejecting shortwave and surface low across the
central Plains and Midwest by Saturday, and ahead of its ensemble
mean.  There is more spread in the guidance across southern Canada
for the weekend, and the GFS is more out of phase with the
CMC/ECMWF across eastern Canada.  This will tend to introduce more
uncertainties in the forecast for days 6 and 7.  The WPC forecast
was primarily based on a multi-deterministic blend, including the
6Z GFS, through early Friday, and then gradually increasing
percentages of the GEFS/ECENS whilst still maintaining some of the
00Z ECMWF and CMC. /Hamrick


...Overview...

Expect a significant change in the upper level pattern over the
course of the period, with a western U.S. ridge/broad eastern
trough as of Wednesday transitioning toward an amplified northern
Plains through western U.S. trough/eastern ridge configuration by
next weekend.  As this evolution occurs, precipitation over the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will spread across more of
the West, to be followed by a broad area of various precipitation
types developing over the central U.S. as low pressure tracks
through the Plains and Upper Great Lakes.  Early in the period a
northern tier wave may spread some snow across areas from the
Upper Midwest into the Northeast.  Western/central states will see
a pronounced cooler trend in temperatures, from well above normal
to below normal, while above normal temperatures over the southern
half or so of the East should expand northward next weekend.  Far
northern tier areas will tend to be colder than normal on most
days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest cycles of guidance maintain the recent theme of better
than average agreement for the large-scale pattern evolution but
continued differences for some details.  Subtle differences in
evolution of southern Canada energy flowing into/through the
eastern North America mean trough continue to produce greater than
average spread for the specifics of a surface wave that may track
from the Midwest through the Northeast from Wednesday into early
Thursday.  CMC/UKMET runs have consistently been on the stronger
and northern side of the model spread for this wave.  The notable
change in the past day has been with the 00Z GFS/GEFS mean
trending to a slower/weaker version of the CMC/UKMET scenario,
extending a modest trend from the 18Z cycle.  This leaves the 12Z
ECMWF still the new 00Z run on the weak and suppressed side of the
spread.  The preferred solution adjusted the wave's track somewhat
northward from previous cycle given relative support from the
means but maintained a fairly weak depiction due to the
considerable spread.

Meanwhile guidance is still in the process of refining the
forecast of upper troughing that moves into the West.  00Z runs so
far are adding support to the idea of a slightly slower/sharper
lead shortwave reaching the West Coast, leaving the 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean a bit on the faster side.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted slower.  This energy should ultimately cross the West and
eject through the Plains, supporting a Plains through Upper Great
Lakes surface system from late week through the weekend.
Consistent with trends seen farther west, this system has adjusted
a little slower over the past day.  Low-predictability trailing
energy dropping into the mean trough (as eastern Pacific ridging
steadily builds) continues to complicate the forecast of the
leading impulse to some degree.  Still, there is better than
average agreement regarding the fairly deep trough forecast to be
over the West as of day 7 Sunday.

The 12Z/18Z operational model blend used for the first half of the
period provided the desired adjustment for the eastern U.S. wave
while representing an intermediate solution for the shortwave
entering the West.  Then a trend toward more even weight of models
and ensemble means later in the period accounted for the good
pattern agreement but uncertainty in some of the details.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and high elevation snow from the Pacific Northwest/northern
California into northern Rockies as of midweek will spread across
more of the West later in the week, while trending lighter along
the West Coast, as an upper trough moves into and through the
region.  Continued progression of this energy should support a
central Plains into Upper Great Lakes surface low and frontal
system late week into the weekend, with a corresponding broad area
of precipitation over the central U.S.  Best potential for wintry
precipitation types will extend from the northern half of the High
Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England, with
a band of significant snow possible to the northwest of the
surface low track.  Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S.  Well ahead of this
system, a northern tier wave may spread snow across an area from
the Upper Midwest into New England from Wednesday into Thursday.
Thus far guidance has not been agreeable with details of the
surface wave so coverage and amounts of snow have lower than
average confidence.  A lower-probability scenario could lead to a
somewhat farther southward axis.

A majority of the lower 48 will see above normal temperatures on
Wednesday, with areas along the central/eastern Canadian border as
well as the western Gulf Coast being the main exceptions.  Then
the West and northern-central Plains will trend steadily cooler
with time while above normal readings over the southern half of
the East expand northward by next weekend.  Expect the warmest
anomalies of plus 20-25F or so for highs to be over the central
Plains Wednesday through Thursday or Friday.  Other warm areas may
see plus 10-20F anomalies with some locally higher readings
possible.  Northern Plains into Rockies locations may see highs
10-15F below normal by next Sunday.

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic guidance is generally in above
average agreement on the large scale pattern through the end of
the week, with the highest level of confidence in the southern
stream and the building upper trough over the Intermountain West

...Heavy rain and snow melt to contribute to increasing flooding
concerns across portions of the Pacific Northwest...

...Above normal temperatures extending across much of the U.S.
through the early part of the week...

A series of Pacific systems are likely to produce unsettled
weather from the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies
through the early part of the week.  The system that moved into
the region earlier today will continue to weaken, providing a
brief lull before the next system begins to impact the area
tonight.  Associated with an atmospheric river, this next system
is forecast to direct a long fetch of deep Pacific moisture into
the Northwest -- fueling heavy precipitation across western
Washington and northwestern Oregon.  The heaviest precipitation is
expected to develop overnight and continue into tomorrow.  As snow
levels increase, the combination of heavy rain along with melting
snow may raise flooding concerns in the coming days across
portions of the Northwest.

Elsewhere across the western U.S., high pressure and dry
conditions are forecast to continue through the early part of the
week.  Temperatures are expected to warm to above average, with
offshore winds promoting near-record to record high temperatures
across portions of California tomorrow and Tuesday.

Across the central and eastern U.S., a fast-moving system is
expected produce rain changing to snow from eastern North Dakota
to the upper Great Lakes tomorrow, before producing some generally
light snow accumulations across the Northeast on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, a second system is forecast to deliver some additional
light snow and mixed precipitation across the northern Great
Plains to the upper Great Lakes on Tuesday.  South of the these
systems, temperatures are forecast to warm, with above to
well-above normal temperatures expanding across the Plains and
Midwest into midweek.

Following a chilly start to the week behind an arctic front
dropping south through the Northeast and the Mid Atlantic,
temperatures are forecast to moderate on Tuesday and Wednesday
across much of the eastern U.S. as well.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 PM CST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 281200Z - 011200Z

The previous forecast remains largely on track, with no changes
made. However, guidance consensus has trended weaker with the
surface winds across northeast New Mexico into the Oklahoma
Panhandle. At least gusty winds are still expected across the
Elevated area in the southern High Plains, where fuels are very dry
and receptive to fire spread. Still, Elevated highlights across the
southern High Plains may be removed in future outlooks if the
guidance trends any weaker with the surface wind fields.

..Squitieri.. 02/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CST Sun Feb 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and accompanying enhanced flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies, resulting in lee troughing over the High
Plains -- where a dry antecedent airmass will exist. Farther west, a
midlevel ridge will build over the West Coast, reinforcing surface
high pressure over the Intermountain West and offshore flow over
southern California.

...Central and Southern Plains...
Dry boundary-layer conditions aided by downslope flow will continue
across most of the central and southern Plains, where minimum
afternoon RH of 10-15 percent is expected. Over portions of the
southern High Plains, a few hours of elevated conditions will be
possible, as sustained northerly surface winds near 15 mph develop
amid the critically-low RH. While less certain, breezy
north-northwesterly surface winds will also be possible across the
central Plains, though confidence in the development of sustained 15
mph surface winds is too low to introduce highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will be maintained over southern
California, while mid/upper-level northeasterly winds strengthen
across the region. This will result in northeasterly wind gusts of
30-50 mph amid 10-15 percent RH over portions of Ventura, Los
Angeles, and Orange Counties. Current indications are that high live
fuel moisture will continue to mitigate the fire-weather threat,
though trends will be monitored closely as fuels continue to dry
across the area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 AM CST Mon Feb 28 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the western two thirds of
the CONUS, resulting in above average temperatures across the
central and southern Plains. This will favor another day of
widespread 10-15 percent minimum afternoon RH, though light surface

158 AM EST Mon Feb 28 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 03 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 07 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that a steadily building
eastern Pacific upper ridge from late this week into early next
week will help to establish mean troughing from central Canada
through the western U.S.  This general pattern appears likely to
persist beyond the medium range period.  Ahead of the developing
mean trough, eastward progression of an initial Rockies/High
Plains upper ridge will eventually displace an eastern North
American mean trough.  By early next week a broad zone of
southwesterly flow should exist downstream from the mean trough
axis.  Leading energy moving into and through the West will spread
precipitation across the region and then bring a broad area of
various precip types to the central U.S. as its northeastward
ejection supports a Plains through Upper Great Lakes surface
system late Friday through the weekend.  The trailing front may
become a focus for enhanced rainfall over parts of the
east-central U.S. late weekend into early next week.  Below normal
temperatures will spread over an increasing portion of the
western/central U.S. with time while above normal temperatures
become more focused over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

From a multi-day mean perspective, guidance continues to show very
good agreement and continuity for the expected large scale
pattern.  The embedded details continue to offer varying degrees
of uncertainty though.  Recent runs have been nudging a little
slower with the leading shortwave entering the West late this week
but the past couple UKMET runs appear somewhat extreme with their
southwestward elongation as the feature nears the coast.  Models
continue to show different ideas for how this energy will evolve
as it ejects through the Plains during the weekend, with various
influences from low-predictability small-scale trailing impulses
dropping into the mean trough as well as possibly southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. energy.  As a result operational models
show about a 20 mb spread for surface low pressure by the time the
system reaches the Upper Great Lakes by early Sunday, with the
18Z/00Z GFS on the weak side and the 12Z ECMWF deepest.  The 00Z
CMC has come in almost as strong as the 12Z ECMWF.  A curious
evolution aloft in the 00Z GFS keeps its weak system stuck over
the Great Lakes an extra day, versus the ensemble means that
maintain a reasonable northeastward progression.  Adding to the
intrigue, the new 00Z ECMWF trends much weaker and even replaces
it with another system by Monday.  Behind the Great Lakes system,
confidence is fairly low for shortwave details within the western
trough (as demonstrated in consecutive ECMWF runs) but there is
reasonable consensus that the front trailing from the
aforementioned system should become aligned with flow aloft by
early next week.

During the first half of the period the 18Z GFS, 12Z CMC, and past
two ECMWF runs through 12Z/27 provided the best cluster of
guidance with general ensemble mean support.  Then the forecast
trended to an even model/ensemble mean weight by day 7 Monday
given the increasing detail uncertainties.  This approach yielded
an intermediate solution for the system tracking through the Upper
Great Lakes.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The system moving into the West late this week will spread a broad
area of mostly light to moderate (though perhaps locally heavier)
rain and high elevation snow across the region.  Some scattered
precipitation may persist over the West through the rest of the
period depending on shortwave details.  Toward the end of the week
through the weekend precipitation should become more widespread
across the central U.S. as low pressure tracks from the central
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes.  The best potential for
wintry precipitation types continues to extend from the northern
half of the High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually
New England.  Highest probability of significant snowfall
currently exists over the Upper Midwest, just to the northwest of
the surface low track.  There is still considerable uncertainty
over the strength of the system so confidence in the
precipitation/wind specifics is fairly low.  Rainfall of varying
intensity will be possible over the rest of the
central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing cold front.
Guidance is signaling the potential for heavier rainfall within an
area from the southern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by
Saturday night/Sunday into Monday, as the front decelerates while
it becomes more aligned with flow aloft and interacts with low
level Gulf moisture.  The northern fringe of this late-period
moisture shield could contain some wintry weather.

Late this week expect above normal temperatures from the
central/southern Plains through the Southeast, and including back
to the Great Basin/Southwest on Thursday.  Highest anomalies
should be in the plus 15-25F range over the central Plains.  On
the other hand the northern tier may see readings up to 10-20F
below normal.  Colder air overspreading the West starting late
this week will continue to expand into the Plains during the
weekend into early next week, yielding a broad area of
temperatures 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile the
eastern U.S. will see increasing coverage of warmer temperatures
Saturday-Monday, generally plus 10-20F anomalies for highs and up
to plus 20-25F anomalies for morning lows.  Temperatures may
challenge record highs over the Southeast.

...Heavy rain and snow melt to contribute to increasing flooding
concerns across portions of the Pacific Northwest...

...Above normal temperatures will expand eastward into the eastern
U.S. but cold conditions with periods of light snow remain across
the northern tier...

A series of Pacific low pressure systems are expected to bring
more unsettled weather from the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Rockies through at least the next couple of days.  The
high moisture content ahead of the latest system has begun to
produce heavy precipitation across northwestern Washington.  Heavy
rain near the coast and heavy snow across the high elevations are
expected to continue through today and into tonight before a
gradual lessening trend sets in by early on Tuesday.  As the low
pressure system edges closer to the coast, milder air from the
Pacific is forecast progress northward through the Pacific
Northwest, leading to a gradual increase of snow levels in the
mountains.  The precipitation is expected to become less intense
on Tuesday but will likely continue into Wednesday morning.  Much
of the precipitation should change over to rain by Tuesday except
perhaps near the highest peaks near the Canadian border.  As snow
levels increase, the combination of heavy rain along with melting
snow may raise flooding concerns in the coming days across
portions of the Northwest.

Elsewhere across the western U.S., high pressure and dry
conditions are forecast to continue through the early part of the
week with gusty Santa Ana winds at times.  Offshore winds will
promote warm afternoons that could challenge record high
temperatures at a few locations today and Tuesday.

Across the central and eastern U.S., a fast-moving system is
expected to bring mainly light snow, mixing with rain during the
day, from eastern North Dakota to the upper Great Lakes today.  By
Tuesday into Tuesday night, the system will likely bring generally
light snow accumulations across the interior Northeast.
Meanwhile, another clipper system is forecast to deliver some
additional light snow and mixed precipitation across the northern
Great Plains to the upper Great Lakes on Tuesday.  South of the
these systems, temperatures are forecast to warm considerably,
with above to well-above normal temperatures expanding across the
Plains and Midwest into midweek.  High temperatures are forecast
to approach 80 degrees at the warmest spots.

Following a frigid start to the week behind an arctic front that
has quickly exited the Northeast and the Mid-Atlantic early today,
temperatures are forecast to moderate on Tuesday and Wednesday
across much of the eastern U.S. as the warm air in the Plains
begins to expand toward the east.  Light rain will exit northern
Florida and the southeast U.S. coast this morning as a cold front
slides more quickly offshore.

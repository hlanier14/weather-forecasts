Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Jul 15 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR AUGUST 2021

The August 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on dynamic=
al
model guidance including the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and
Copernicus Multi-Model Ensemble (C3S), statistical tools, current soil
moisture
conditions, and potential influences from modes of tropical variability. Th=
e
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) weakened during early July due to interfere=
nce
with an equatorial Rossby wave and a couple of atmospheric Kelvin waves.
Dynamical models depict the MJO resuming an eastward propagation during the
latter half of July and this could eventually lead to a more favorable
large-scale environment for tropical cyclone (TC) development across the ea=
st
Pacific and Atlantic basins later next month. The MJO evolution and its
associated modulation of TC development will be reevaluated at the end of
July.



Anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the middle to high latitudes of western Nort=
h
America has persisted since early June which resulted in much above normal
temperatures and record-setting heat across the western and north-central
CONUS. Periodic amplification of a downstream trough over the eastern CONUS=
 is
a common feature this summer along with a weakness in the subtropical ridge
along the Gulf Coast. Although the anomalous ridging and associated above
normal temperatures are forecast to shift eastward during week-2 (Jul 22-28=
),
the week 3-4 dynamical models depict a retrogression of the ridge axis to
western North America heading into August Therefore, the temperature outloo=
k
for the CONUS closely resembles observations during the past 30 days. Above
normal temperatures are favored throughout the western and north-central CO=
NUS
and also along the East Coast. The largest probabilities (above 60 percent)=
 of
above normal temperatures are forecast across the Northern Rockies and
Northern
High Plains, due to very low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile) and g=
ood
model agreement. Conversely, high soil moisture (above the 90th percentile)
across parts of the Southern Great Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, and
Western Gulf Coast supports elevated probabilities of below normal
temperatures
for those areas. Also, favored wetness during August is consistent with thi=
s
forecast. Based on dynamical models and decadal trends, above normal
temperatures are favored for Southwest Mainland Alaska along with the
Aleutians
and Alaska Peninsula. Probabilities of above normal temperature are reduced
slightly for the Alaska Peninsula due to negative sea surface temperature
anomalies to its south.



The NMME and a lagged precipitation outlook from soil moisture support
elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation from the Northern Rockies east =
to
parts of the Northern to Central Great Plains. Based on decadal trends and =
the
NMME, above normal precipitation is favored for the Mid-Atlantic, Eastern C=
orn
Belt, Tennessee Valley, and Lower Mississippi Valley. Although week 3-4
dynamical models depict an enhanced Monsoon during early August, equal chan=
ces
(EC) of below, near, or above normal precipitation are forecast for the Des=
ert
Southwest ad Four Corners Region due to weak signals among the monthly tool=
s.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, EC is necessary at this half month time lead fo=
r
the monthly precipitation outlook and adjustments are anticipated for the
updated outlook, released on July 31. The elevated probabilities of above
normal precipitation, forecast across northeast Mainland Alaska, are based =
on
the NMME and consistent with decadal trends.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020, followi=
ng
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalie=
s
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represe=
nt
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for Aug will be issued on Sat July 31 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Jul 15 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

ENSO-neutral conditions persist across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, as
indicated by current oceanic and atmospheric observations. The CPC/IRI ENSO
consensus forecast predicts that ENSO-neutral conditions are likely to pers=
ist
through the next three-month season, while La Nina conditions are more like=
ly
in autumn and winter. By winter there is approximately an equal chance of w=
eak
La Nina conditions, moderate-to-strong La Nina conditions, or ENSO-neutral
conditions. El Nino is the least likely scenario through winter.



The August-September-October (ASO) 2021 temperature outlook favors above
normal
temperatures for the western half of the CONUS, the Midwest, and the easter=
n
quarter of the CONUS, with the largest probabilities exceeding 60 percent o=
ver
parts of the Great Basin and Central Rockies as well as the Northeast. The =
ASO
2021 precipitation outlook predicts enhanced probabilities of below normal
precipitation across much of the western half of the CONUS, excluding parts=
 of
the Pacific Northwest, as well as the Northern Plains and western Great Lak=
es
region. Above normal precipitation is likely for the central and eastern Gu=
lf
Coast region and from the Apppalachians to the Atlantic Coast, excluding th=
e
Florida Peninsula. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the
southern coast, eastern interior, and North Slope of Mainland Alaska, as we=
ll
as the northern Alaska Panhandle. Equal chances (EC) are indicated for area=
s
where probabilities for each category of seasonal mean temperatures and
seasonal accumulated precipitation are expected to be similar to
climatological
probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictio=
ns/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!ujaqW88DkaxaKfaFeKdsX6ukJ3f3TDaar3Xagy_9=
jfeO7TIBf8NpypvUxtoCThLrRvIRuCjm$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions. Sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are near climatological average=
s
across most of the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Positive subsurface temperatur=
e
anomalies persisted across most of the Pacific Ocean, while negative
temperature anomalies emerged at depths of 50 to 200 meters in the eastern
equatorial Pacific Ocean. Integrated upper-ocean heat anomalies, that have
been
positive since March, are now near zero. Convection is suppressed near the
Date
Line and enhanced near the Maritime Continent, while low-level easterlies a=
nd
upper-level westerlies are near climatological averages over much of the
equatorial Pacific Ocean.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

Dynamical models of the NMME predict weak Nino 3.4 SST anomalies between ze=
ro
and -0.5 C in the next three months, followed by larger anomalies below -0.=
5
C,
the threshold for potential La Nina conditions, later in autumn and through
winter. Statistical models generally predict ENSO-neutral conditions, with
Nino
3.4 SST anomalies between -0.5 and +0.5 C over the same period. The CPC SST
Consolidation, a skill weighted combination of dynamical and statistical
models, tracks more closely to the dynamical model forecasts with the
probability of La Nina increasing through autumn into winter. The Copernicu=
s
(C3S) international, multi-model ensemble system, in contrast to the NMME,
predicts a greater persistence of weak negative Nino 3.4 SST anomalies thro=
ugh
autumn, reflecting ENSO-neutral conditions. The official CPC/IRI consensus
ENSO
outlook calls for greater than a 50 percent probability of La Nina through
five
overlapping seasons from SON 2021 through JFM 2022, consistent with the
historical tendency for a second winter of La Nina following the first La N=
ina
winter, and predictions from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model forecasts from the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMM=
E)
and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model ensemble systems are used extensively for =
the
first six leads when they are available. The ENSO-OCN statistical forecast
tool
was used for the OND 2021 through FMA 2022 seasons to determine expected
climate impacts of likely La Nina conditions, as predicted by the CPC ENSO
outlook and CPC SST consolidation forecast, in addition to decadal climate
trends. The objective, skill weighted consolidation, that combines both
dynamical and statistical forecast tools, was used for all leads.



Anomalously wet soil moisture conditions across the Southern Plains and Low=
er
Mississippi Valley and anomalous dry soil moisture conditions across the
western CONUS and Northern Plains were factors in the temperature outlook f=
or
late summer and early fall. At longer leads, decadal climate trends in
temperature and precipitation, as represented by the OCN tool, are the prim=
ary
climate signal in the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - ASO 2021 TO ASO 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are likely throughout a majority of the forecast
domain during ASO, except for parts of the Southern and Central Plains and =
the
Lower and Middle Mississippi Valley, where equal chances (EC) of below, nea=
r,
or above normal temperatures are forecast. This EC area corresponds to weak=
er
signals in the dynamical model temperature forecasts, as well as areas with
persistent abnormally wet soil moisture conditions. A reduction in above
normal
temperature probabilities for this area relative to last month's outlook is
seen for both ASO and SON. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are
increased relative to last months outlook across the Northern Rockies and
Northern Plains, as indicated by the NMME dynamical model forecasts and due=
 in
part to continued dry soil moisture conditions. Above normal temperatures a=
re
likely for most of Alaska in ASO, with an expanded area of EC for southeast=
ern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, as indicated by dynamical model forecast=
s.



For SON, above normal temperatures are favored across the entire CONUS,
corresponding to dynamical model forecasts and the decreased impact of
anomalous soil moisture conditions. For OND 2021 through MAM 2022, the
seasonal
outlook represents the enhanced likelihood of La Nina. Positive decadal
temperature trends across most of the domain are moderated by the impacts o=
f
temperature variability due to La Nina. Areas of EC expand across southern
Alaska and the northern tier of the CONUS in OND 2021 through MAM 2022,
including the Pacific Northwest, Northern and Central Plains, and western
Great
Lakes regions. Below normal temperatures are more likely for parts of the
Pacific Northwest in DJF through FMA 2022, and across the northern tier int=
o
parts of the Northern Plains in FMA. Below normal temperatures are also
favored
for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle in JFM a=
nd
FMA 2022, due to potential La Nina impacts.



For AMJ 2022 and thereafter, the forecast pattern primarily reflects decada=
l
trends with above normal temperatures favored for much of the West and acro=
ss
the southern and eastern CONUS through next spring and summer. Probabilitie=
s
of
above normal temperatures peak in the summer of next year across the West a=
nd
along the Atlantic coast, consistent with the seasonal influence of decadal
climate trends. Decadal trends favor above normal temperatures for
northwestern
areas of Alaska next spring, related to long term changes in sea ice cover
during this season, and across the state by summer of 2022.

PRECIPITATION

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME support slightly elevated
probabilities
of below normal precipitation for much of the West into the Northern Plains
and
western Great Lakes region, excluding parts of the Pacific Northwest, in th=
e
ASO seasonal outlook. Dynamical model forecasts favor above normal
precipitation in ASO for much of the central and eastern Gulf Coast region,
excluding the Florida Peninsula, and from the Appalachians eastward to the
Atlantic coast. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are enhanced f=
or
eastern areas of the Alaska Mainland, consistent with decadal trends, the S=
ST
constructed analog forecast, and dynamical model forecasts from the NMME an=
d
C3S. Enhanced probabilities for below normal precipitation persist for much=
 of
the Southwest and across the Great Plains in SON, while enhanced probabilit=
ies
of above normal precipitation continue for the Mid-Atlantic, as supported b=
y
the NMME. Below normal precipitation for the Southwest in early autumn is
consistent with the increasing possibility of La Nina conditions, and the
potential inhibition of tropical activity in the eastern Pacific. Beginning=
 in
the OND seasonal outlook, the precipitation pattern begins to evolve to
reflect
the increasing likelihood of La Nina. Below normal precipitation is general=
ly
favored across southern regions of the CONUS from Southern California to th=
e
Southeast by winter. Above normal precipitation is more likely for parts of
the
Pacific Northwest for NDJ and DJF and for southeastern Mainland Alaska in D=
JF
and JFM 2022.



From next winter into next spring and summer the precipitation pattern
forecast
increasingly reflects decadal precipitation trends. Enhanced probabilities =
of
below normal precipitation persist for much of the Southwest through MAM 20=
22,
while probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced for parts of
the
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys from JFM through AMJ 2022 and for parts of the
Mid-Atlantic in AMJ through ASO 2022. Decadal trends are the primary signal
for
above normal precipitation for the North Slope of Alaska in NDJ 2021 throug=
h
FMA 2022 and for parts of eastern interior Alaska in JJA through ASO 2022.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

Minor refinements were made to the area delineating potential for
isolated dry thunderstorms over portions of southeast Idaho and far
west-central Wyoming. A slight expansion was made into these
regions, based on the most recent CAM solutions and calibrated
guidance. Greater storm coverage and potential for wetting rains is
expected in areas south of this region, negating any further
expansion.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 07/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will slowly shift eastward through the northern
Rockies this afternoon. In the Northwest, broad cyclonic flow will
move inland. Mid-level moisture will reach as far north as the
Northern Rockies. At the surface, strong heating will promote
thermal pressure trough development in the lee of the Cascades and
the northern Sierra.

...Cascade Gaps/Columbia Gorge...
Westerly surface winds will increase during the day as the thermal
trough deepens. Winds of 15-20 mph are expected, though localized
20-25 mph may occur. RH within the terrain is the most uncertain as
onshore winds may elevated moisture. However, 15-25% appears likely
enough to support fire growth given the dry fuels.

...Northwest Nevada into south-central Idaho...
With the development of cyclonic flow along the West Coast,
mid-level winds are expected to increase as compared to Wednesday.
This, when combined with the surface trough, will drive 15-20 mph
winds across a good portion of the northern Great Basin. RH of
10-20% is expected during the afternoon.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Though synoptic forcing will be weak, mid-level moisture appears
sufficient for isolated thunderstorms from northern Utah into
southwestern Montana. Storm motions will be higher with northern
extent. The greatest risk for lightning ignitions will be from
west-central Utah into southwest Montana and adjacent central Idaho.
In these locations, PWAT of 0.5-0.7 will overlap with fast enough
storm motions to reduce potential for wetting rains.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is good model agreement regarding mid-level high pressure
across the western lower 48 during week-2, although there is disagreement
regarding how far east this feature will shift over the period. The 0Z GEFS
favors positive mid-level height anomalies shifting eastward across the
Midwest
to the Eastern Seaboard, whereas the 0Z ECMWF maintains this feature over t=
he
western contiguous U.S. and upper Midwest. Despite these model differences,
excessive heat continues to be the primary hazards concern for week-2. Part=
s
of
the Great Plains may experience maximum temperatures greater than 100 Deg F=
 on
multiple days, with parts of the Northern Plains potentially reaching or
exceeding daily records. Some of this heat may shift eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic by the middle of the period. An active North American Monsoon
circulation is forecast to promote above-normal precipitation and possible
flooding over the Desert Southwest. Mid-level height anomalies are predicte=
d
to
be near to slightly above normal across Alaska. No hazards are anticipated =
for
the state during the period.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota, Fri-Sat=
,
Jul 23-24.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Upper Mississippi Valle=
y,
Northern Plains, and Northern and Central Rockies, Fri-Sat, Jul 23-24.

Slight risk of excessive heat for the Great Basin, Northern and Central
Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Vall=
ey,
Fri-Thu, Jul 23-29.

Slight risk of excessive heat for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Sun-Thu, Jul 25-29.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal parts of California,
Fri-Tue, Jul 23-27.

Possible flooding for portions of the Southwest and southern portions of th=
e
Central Great Basin.

SG2bK4mkD1m$

FOR FRIDAY JULY 23 - THURSDAY JULY 29: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict amplified ridging returning across the western CONUS durin=
g
week-1 with positive mid-level height anomalies building across the
north-central CONUS. By the beginning of week-2, the magnitude of the heigh=
t
anomalies begin to wane compared to late in week-1, although elevated chanc=
es
of excessive heat continue into week-2, with anomalously warm overnight
temperatures also a concern. Uncalibrated 0Z ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means
indicate minimum temperatures at least 10 Deg F above normal. The reforecas=
t
tools do not indicate elevated potential for nighttime temperatures exceedi=
ng
80 Deg F, but the 6Z deterministic GFS indicates nighttime temperatures
reaching the upper 70s to low 80s Deg F. A high risk of excessive heat is
posted for parts of the Dakotas and Minnesota, July 23 to 24, where both th=
e
ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 Deg F. A moderate risk of
excessive heat is designated for parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley,
Northern Plains, and Northern and Central Rockies, July 23 to 24, and a
broader
region is highlighted for a slight risk of excessive heat across parts of t=
he
Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, Northern and Central Plains, and
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley throughout week-2. With the mid-level
ridge
potentially shifting eastward, a slight risk of excessive heat is posted fo=
r
portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, a=
nd
Mid-Atlantic, July 25 to 29, primarily based on the GEFS reforecast tool. O=
f
additional concern is the increased humidity forecast across some regions,
particularly across the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic, which
could
support heat index values greater than 100 Deg F (105 Deg F across the
Mid-Atlantic).



The orientation of the mid-level ridge across the West combined with therma=
l
low pressure over The Great Basin and Baja California may be conducive to
episodes of enhanced monsoonal moisture flow across portions of the Desert
Southwest. Although accumulated precipitation amounts in the model guidance
are
not supportive of a heavy precipitation hazard, the localized convective
nature
of the precipitation could result in flash flooding across the valleys. The
possible flood risk area highlighted is based on the ECMWF reforecast tool,
where there is at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the
85th percentile and half an inch (the GEFS reforecast tool does not indicat=
e
this enhanced wet signal). Flash flooding can occur even in areas that do n=
ot
receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff from precipitation
upstream.



Surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific, int=
o
parts of the Pacific Northwest, while thermal low pressure is anticipated o=
ver
the Great Basin and Desert Southwest during week-2, related to the
aforementioned anomalous ridging predicted. The strong mean pressure gradie=
nt
situated over coastal California increases chances for episodic high winds =
in
the region. A slight risk of high winds remains posted across coastal porti=
ons
of northern and central California for July 23 to 27, where both reforecast
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the
85th percentile and 25 mph during the early and middle portion of week-2.
Increased wind speeds combined with anticipated dry conditions could promot=
e
the spread of wildfires due to the ongoing hot and dry conditions in the ar=
ea.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing in the Bering Sea and across most of Alaska, favoring increased
chances for above normal precipitation across many parts of the Mainland an=
d
the Aleutians. Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are forecast to be
under an inch for most areas in both reforecast tools, precluding a related
hazard from being designated. Generally seasonable temperatures are forecas=
t
across the state, with a slight tilt toward above normal temperatures acros=
s
the northeastern Mainland, and near to below normal temperatures elsewhere
across Alaska.

Valid 12Z Sun Jul 18 2021 - 12Z Thu Jul 22 2021

...Hot temperatures from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

An upper high over the Four Corners region Sunday will drift into
Wyoming, maintaining well above normal temperatures for much of
the region into the northern Plains. A deep upper low off the
coast of British Columbia/Haida Gwaii will very slowly wobble
inland over the period as the upper ridge over the Rockies
flattens a bit. In the East, upper troughing will be reinforced
from Canada and likely detach its southern extent westward across
the Lower Mississippi Valley and southern Plains toward the upper
Rio Grande, favoring a wetter and cooler than average pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The ensembles remained in very good agreement overall with the
longwave evolution and saw no reason to deviate from the
consensus. The 00Z ECMWF and somewhat the Canadian offered the
best clustering with the means as the GFS runs were more
aggressive with troughing in the east as a result of a more
amplified pattern upstream (slower with the upper low off BC).
Multi-day ensemble trend was slightly more amplified overall but
it is unclear if this will continue or if it was just within the
typical noise of a day 6-7 forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/northern Plains will sustain very warm to hot
temperatures across these regions--90s and lower 100s at lower
elevations this weekend into next week, which are 10-20 degrees
above normal. This may near or exceed daily records especially
Sun/Mon. The above normal area will expand eastward into MN and WI
around midweek. Temperatures in the Southern Tier/Southwest will
be slightly below normal due to increased cloud cover and higher
rainfall chances as a cold front settles (and dissipates) into the
Southeast Mon-Wed. Rainfall could be locally heavy in parts of the
central to southern Plains and MS Valley Sun-Tue along and ahead
of the front. Farther west, the monsoon season has been more
active than last summer in AZ and nearby areas with conditions
favorable to persist, enhanced by the retrograding weakness aloft.
Rainfall could even extend into Southeastern California later in
the week.

A wavy and slow-moving lead front will through the Northeast with
its tail-end over the southern Mid-Atlantic as it settles over the
South/Southeast, with scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms and locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
locally train.  High temperatures are forecast to fall below
normal into early next week due the clouds and showers but near
normal in its wake. Another cold front out of Canada could provide
additional cooling of a few degrees around the eastern Great
Lakes/Northeast later next week in what is typically they hottest
time of the year.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 PM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

An elevated area was added to portions of northern Nevada, far
northeast California, southwest Idaho, and far southeast Oregon.
Conditions will be similar to D1/Thurs, with sustained southwesterly
surface winds of 10-15 mph amid RH values in the low teens and
receptive fuels.

Additionally, some expansion was made to the area delineating
potential for isolated dry thunderstorms into portions of central
Idaho and central/northern Montana, based on recent CAM runs and
calibrated guidance. Notably, there is signal for scattered dry
thunderstorm potential, particularly north of the Snake Plain into
west-central Montana. This area will need to be monitored closely in
future outlooks, as ERCs are near record levels in this region.

..Karstens.. 07/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Thu Jul 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level pattern on Friday will remain similar to Thursday
across the West. The trough off the Northwest coast will move closer
to shore and mid-level winds will increase across Washington and
Oregon. Surface troughing in the lee of the Cascades into the Great
Basin develop during the afternoon/evening. The upper ridge centered
on the Continental Divide is expected to build northward into the
northern High Plains and Canadian Prairies.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Though the ridge will intensify during the day, a slight increase in
mid-level moisture should allow convection to develop again in
southwest Montana, northwestern Wyoming, and adjacent Idaho.
Coverage will remain isolated. Storm motions will be similar, and
perhaps slightly quicker, than on Thursday. With continued low
potential for wetting rains, lightning ignitions will be possible in
these areas.

...Lee of Washington Cascades...
Though wind speeds will increase aloft, along with a modest surface
gradient present, a stronger push of marine air will likely keep RH
higher than previous days. Elevated conditions are only expected to
be localized.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu July 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 21 - 25 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a  ridge over the
southern Aleutians with above normal 500-hPa heights extending to eastern
Mainland Alaska, and a trough over the eastern North Pacific centered near =
the
coast of western North America. A ridge is predicted over the western and
central CONUS with positive height anomalies extending to the Northern Plai=
ns
and western Great Lakes. Downstream a positively tilted trough is predicted
over the eastern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights from parts of the
Southern Plains to most of the eastern CONUS.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over parts of eastern
Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights, while below norm=
al
temperatures are favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above normal temperature=
s
are also favored for parts of the western CONUS, much of the Northern Plain=
s
and Great Lakes due to the persistent ridging. A predicted trough over the
eastern CONUS, as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts of the Southwe=
st,
favors enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures from par=
ts
of the Southwest eastward to parts of the Southeast and Northeast. Above
normal
temperatures are likely over southern Florida.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm
system
development. Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the
Northwest eastward to much of the northern and central CONUS due to forecas=
t
ridge over the region. The positively tilted trough forecast in the eastern
U.S. supports a more southerly storm track, increasing the likelihood of ab=
ove
normal precipitation for the Southern Plains, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool. The position of the predicted 500-hPa ridge an=
d
low-level flow is favorable for increased monsoonal moisture and above norm=
al
precipitation in the Southwest, extending into much of the Great Basin.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 23 - 29 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to shift eastward and deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar t=
o
the 6-10 day period, with a couple of exceptions. Near normal temperatures =
are
favored over California and above normal temperature probabilities are
increased over parts of the Mid-Atlantic Region due to forecast eastward
progression of the mean troughs. The precipitation probability forecast is
also
very similar to the 6-10 day period with the probability slightly reduced.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the
Central/Eastern U.S. and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat returns this weekend to the Northern Plains ...

A slow moving frontal system across the Northeast, Midwest, and
Plains will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms through the
period. The air mass ahead of the front is seasonably moist, with
dewpoints in the low 70s, contributing to the potential for heavy
rainfall and flooding. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall
remains in effect through tomorrow morning for portions of the
Central Plains east to the Middle Mississippi Valley, focused on
the potential for an additional 1 to 3 inches of rainfall from a
cluster of showers and thunderstorms moving eastward just ahead of
the front. A Slight Risk for Excessive rainfall is in effect from
the Middle Mississippi and Lower Ohio Valleys north to the Lower
Great Lakes on Friday as widespread rainfall over an inch is
expected, with localized maxima of 2-5 inches possible. The
flooding threat continues eastward on Saturday with a Slight Risk
in effect for portions of the Mid-Atlantic and Southern New
England, again for the threat of widespread rainfall over an inch
with localized totals potentially exceeding 3 inches. Much of this
area has also seen significant rainfall over the last couple of
weeks, leading to saturated soils and an increased threat for
flooding. Heavy rainfall is also expected southwestward along the
front across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, the Mid-South, and
the Southern Plains. Areas further to the southwest will see the
threat for heavy rainfall both Friday and Saturday as the front
begins to become more stationary with westward extent.

Flooding is also a concern in the Southwest as the Monsoon
continues. Diurnal heating combined with deep moisture pooled over
the area will drive daily afternoon and evening showers and
thunderstorms across the Four Corners region. A Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall is in effect through Friday morning for
portions of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico for the threat
of heavy downpours with 1 to 2 inches of rain. This is a
particular concern for flooding over burn scars and more urbanized
areas. Marginal Risks are also in effect for both Friday and
Saturday as the risk for instances of 1-2 inches of rain with any
heavy downpours continues.

As many high temperatures across the West return closer to normal,
albeit still a bit above average in some locations, the concern
for hot weather will shift to the Northern Plains as an
upper-level ridge builds over the Northern Rockies. High
temperatures in the low 100s are forecast for the High Plains of
eastern Montana Friday and Saturday, with 90s stretching east
across North Dakota and Northern Minnesota. An Excessive Heat
Watch is in effect for eastern Montana beginning Saturday
afternoon.

Elsewhere, the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will remain hot and
muggy Friday before the eastward moving front brings some relief,
starting with New England on Saturday. Behind the front, the
Midwest will see below normal temperatures, with highs in places
like Chicago only in the mid-70s. The West Coast will also have
cooler temperatures, including much needed relief for Portland and
Seattle where highs will be between 70 to 80 degrees.

...Hot temperatures from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

An upper high over the Four Corners region Sunday will drift into
Wyoming, maintaining well above normal temperatures for much of
the region into the northern Plains. A deep upper low off the
coast of British Columbia/Haida Gwaii will very slowly wobble
inland over the period as the upper ridge over the Rockies
flattens a bit. In the East, upper troughing will be reinforced
from Canada and likely detach its southern extent westward across
the Lower Mississippi Valley and southern Plains toward the upper
Rio Grande, favoring a wetter and cooler than average pattern.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The ensembles remained in very good agreement overall with the
longwave evolution and saw no reason to deviate from the
consensus. The 00Z ECMWF and somewhat the Canadian offered the
best clustering with the means as the GFS runs were more
aggressive with troughing in the east as a result of a more
amplified pattern upstream (slower with the upper low off BC).
Multi-day ensemble trend was slightly more amplified overall but
it is unclear if this will continue or if it was just within the
typical noise of a day 6-7 forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potent upper ridge building from the Great Basin to the
northern Rockies/northern Plains will sustain very warm to hot
temperatures across these regions--90s and lower 100s at lower
elevations this weekend into next week, which are 10-20 degrees
above normal. This may near or exceed daily records especially
Sun/Mon. The above normal area will expand eastward into MN and WI
around midweek. Temperatures in the Southern Tier/Southwest will
be slightly below normal due to increased cloud cover and higher
rainfall chances as a cold front settles (and dissipates) into the
Southeast Mon-Wed. Rainfall could be locally heavy in parts of the
central to southern Plains and MS Valley Sun-Tue along and ahead
of the front. Farther west, the monsoon season has been more
active than last summer in AZ and nearby areas with conditions
favorable to persist, enhanced by the retrograding weakness aloft.
Rainfall could even extend into Southeastern California later in
the week.

A wavy and slow-moving lead front will through the Northeast with
its tail-end over the southern Mid-Atlantic as it settles over the
South/Southeast, with scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms and locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
locally train.  High temperatures are forecast to fall below
normal into early next week due the clouds and showers but near
normal in its wake. Another cold front out of Canada could provide
additional cooling of a few degrees around the eastern Great
Lakes/Northeast later next week in what is typically they hottest
time of the year.

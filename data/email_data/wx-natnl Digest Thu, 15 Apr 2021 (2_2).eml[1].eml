Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Thu Apr 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft is expected to persist across the southern
U.S., while a surface cold front surges southward across the Plains
states. Modestly dry and breezy conditions may accompany westerly
downslope flow ahead of the cold front across portions of far west
Texas into the Trans Pecos region, promoting modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Portions of southwestern Texas...
By afternoon peak heating, 10-20% RH is expected in the vicinity of
the Davis and Chisos Mountains due to deep boundary-layer mixing.
Downslope westerly flow and the departure of a surface low to the
east will both encourage 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds,
coinciding with the favorable RH during the afternoon and preceding
cold frontal arrival. Elevated fire weather highlights have been
introduced since fuels are quite dry and receptive to wildfire
spread.

...Appreciable snow develops today culminating early on Friday
over the central Rockies into the central High Plains...

...Severe thunderstorms possible over central Texas as heavy rain
moves across the central Gulf Coast region...

...Critical Fire Weather conditions expected across the southern
Rockies to southern High Plains...

An upper-level low over the Great Basin will lift toward the
central Rockies today.  This will result in snow expanding across
the central Rockies today and into the central High Plains
tonight.  Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forecast to
intensify along a front just to the south.  Winds are expected to
become strong and gusty by the evening as the snow continues
across the region, where 6 or more inches of snow can be expected
area-wide.  Travel may be difficult with blowing and heavy snow at
some locations during the height of the storm.  The snow should
gradually become less heavy and widespread later on Friday into
Saturday but will likely continue to linger over Colorado and
northern New Mexico into Saturday morning.

A quasi-stationary front near the Gulf Coast States will interact
with moisture returning from the Gulf of Mexico to produce showers
and thunderstorms across parts of the Southern Plains to much of
the Gulf Coast region and into the Southeast through Saturday
morning.  Severe thunderstorms will be most likely today over
central Texas as an upper-level impulse moves through.  These
storms may be accompanied with frequent lightning, severe wind
gusts, hail, and an isolated tornado.  Additionally, some of the
storms will produce heavy rain as a low pressure wave begins to
intensify and track eastward near the central Gulf Coast region
Friday into Saturday morning, where heavy rain could result in
flash flooding.

Meanwhile, a coastal storm associated with an upper-level low over
the Great Lakes is expected to bring main rain across coastal and
lower elevation of New England into Friday.  Interior sections of
New England should see the rain changing over to wet snow on
Friday as the storm intensifies.

Over parts of the Southwest/Four Corners region, dry and windy
weather will make for Elevated to Critical fire weather conditions
through Friday morning.   Red Flag warnings are in effect for
portions of the Four Corners states.

coastal sections and the lower elevations of New England into
early on Saturday.  Interior sections of New England should see
the rain changing over to wet snow Thursday night and then
continuing into Friday as the storm intensifies.  Six to locally
12 inches of snow is possible across the higher elevations of New
England by Saturday morning.  Some gusty winds combining with raw
conditions can also be expected near the coast into Saturday
morning.

Over parts of the southern Rockies to the southern High Plains,
dry and windy weather will make for Elevated to Critical fire
weather conditions through Friday morning.  Red Flag warnings are
in effect for portions of the southern Rockies.

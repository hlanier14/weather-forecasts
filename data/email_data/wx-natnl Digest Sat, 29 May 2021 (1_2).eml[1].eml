Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Fri May 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no major changes. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions are possible across the eastern
Snake River Valley of Idaho this afternoon. Here, gusty winds and
low RH may support rapid curing of fine fuels and a low-end fire
weather risk.

..Lyons.. 05/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CDT Fri May 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low/cold front will sweep
across the eastern CONUS today as a second upper trough traverses
the northern Rockies and upper riding builds across the Southwest.
Appreciable rainfall and modestly moist low-level conditions are
expected to limit the potential for widespread significant
wildfire-spread concerns across most of the eastern U.S. The one
small exception may be portions of the eastern Carolinas to the
central Florida Peninsula. Here, 30-40% RH may be observed by
afternoon peak heating along with 5-15 mph sustained southwesterly
flow ahead of the cold front/surface lee-trough axis. Given very dry
fuels across the region, some localized wildfire-spread potential
may exist during the afternoon.

Farther west, upper ridging and associated weak surface wind fields
are expected to preclude widespread wildfire-spread potential as
well. Given critically dry fuels overspread by 10-15% surface RH
across parts of Arizona into New Mexico, locally Elevated conditions
may manifest in terrain favoring areas that typically favor breezy
conditions during the diurnal heating cycle.

...Record Warm Temperatures Likely Next Week Across the West...
...Heavy Rain Possible Mid-Week Across Southern/Central Plains...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Upper ridging over the West Coast and troughing over the Eastern
U.S. is expected to start the medium range period (May 31). This
pattern is forecast to evolve toward more quasi-zonal flow as the
western ridge breaks down with the approach of Gulf of Alaska and
Eastern Pacific energy dropping into the Pacific Northwest. At the
same time, energy ejecting out into the Plains is likely to carve
a more substantial trough over the central U.S. by the end of the
period.

The latest model guidance offers fairly good predictability and
agreement through the period. Early on, the GFS was noted to be
faster with shortwave energy across the Northeast. The other area
of model differences were later in the period (day 6/7) with the
central U.S. trough and how it progresses across the Great Lakes
and Northeast. Both the deterministic GFS and ECMWF suggest a
closed low forms but the GFS is much further north/northeast
(fast) with that feature compared to the ECMWF, which suggests the
low would remain over the MS River Valley. Although the WPC
preference was for a blend and heavily incorporated the ensemble
means for day 6/7, there are fairly notable sensible weather
differences for QPF, especially for the eastern U.S. as the closed
low could allow for a plume of deeper moisture to overspread the
area with more widespread/unsettled weather.  In the end, the WPC
blend preference maintained continuity given the forecast
uncertainty and lower confidence details.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains as Gulf of Mexico moisture intercepts a
slow moving cold front.  Some locations could see several inches
of rain with the best chance at this point from parts of northern
Texas into Oklahoma. Much of this area is already over saturated
due to above normal precipitation recently which would only
increase flooding concerns across the region. High pressure
building in behind the front may also aid low level upslope flow
to enhance convective development over the High Plains. Rain and
scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread eastward into the
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the
East by mid to late next week ahead of the main trough, but with
less certainty on any areas of focused heavy rainfall totals.
Meanwhile, the West should stay dry beneath upper level ridging
with maybe some scattered precipitation as shortwave energy moves
across the region later next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 20 to 25
degrees above average could approach or exceed record values,
centered around next Tuesday/Wednesday. As the upper ridge weakens
and shifts, values may moderate a bit but still are expected to be
above normal across much of the West and into the northern Plains.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies the first half of the period, while the
Eastern U.S. sits near normal all next week.

Valid 12Z Mon May 31 2021 - 12Z Fri Jun 04 2021

...Record Warm Temperatures Likely Next Week Across the West...
...Heavy Rain Possible Mid-Week Across Southern/Central Plains...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Upper ridging over the West Coast and troughing over the Eastern
U.S. is expected to start the medium range period (May 31). This
pattern is forecast to evolve toward more quasi-zonal flow as the
western ridge breaks down with the approach of Gulf of Alaska and
Eastern Pacific energy dropping into the Pacific Northwest. At the
same time, energy ejecting out into the Plains is likely to carve
a more substantial trough over the central U.S. by the end of the
period.

The latest model guidance offers fairly good predictability and
agreement through the period. Early on, the GFS was noted to be
faster with shortwave energy across the Northeast. The other area
of model differences were later in the period (day 6/7) with the
central U.S. trough and how it progresses across the Great Lakes
and Northeast. Both the deterministic GFS and ECMWF suggest a
closed low forms but the GFS is much further north/northeast
(fast) with that feature compared to the ECMWF, which suggests the
low would remain over the MS River Valley. Although the WPC
preference was for a blend and heavily incorporated the ensemble
means for day 6/7, there are fairly notable sensible weather
differences for QPF, especially for the eastern U.S. as the closed
low could allow for a plume of deeper moisture to overspread the
area with more widespread/unsettled weather.  In the end, the WPC
blend preference maintained continuity given the forecast
uncertainty and lower confidence details.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains as Gulf of Mexico moisture intercepts a
slow moving cold front.  Some locations could see several inches
of rain with the best chance at this point from parts of northern
Texas into Oklahoma. Much of this area is already over saturated
due to above normal precipitation recently which would only
increase flooding concerns across the region. High pressure
building in behind the front may also aid low level upslope flow
to enhance convective development over the High Plains. Rain and
scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread eastward into the
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the
East by mid to late next week ahead of the main trough, but with
less certainty on any areas of focused heavy rainfall totals.
Meanwhile, the West should stay dry beneath upper level ridging
with maybe some scattered precipitation as shortwave energy moves
across the region later next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 20 to 25
degrees above average could approach or exceed record values,
centered around next Tuesday/Wednesday. As the upper ridge weakens
and shifts, values may moderate a bit but still are expected to be
above normal across much of the West and into the northern Plains.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies the first half of the period, while the
Eastern U.S. sits near normal all next week.

The previous outlook remains valid with no major changes. See the

..Lyons.. 05/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri May 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the northern Plains while another
positively tilted upper trough meanders across the eastern U.S. and
upper ridging builds across the southern Plains tomorrow/Saturday.
While the upper pattern does not support widespread significant
wildfire spread potential, a few areas of localized, more favorable
fire weather conditions may manifest.

Compared to Day 1, intensifying surface low pressure across the
Lower Colorado River Basin will support a period of stronger (i.e.
15 mph) sustained southwesterly surface winds across western into
central New Mexico, where 10-20% RH and very dry fuels are in place.
The overlap of stronger winds and favorable RH atop critically dry
fuels necessitates the introduction of an Elevated delineation for
tomorrow afternoon.

A cold front will continue sagging southward across the southeast
U.S with modestly dry, breezy conditions preceding the front across
the Carolinas into the central Florida Peninsula. Given the very dry
fuels in place, localized fire spread may occur wherever dry and
breezy conditions overlap the dry fuels in the absence of Day 1
precipitation accumulations.

On the backside of the eastern upper trough, northeasterly mid-level
flow is expected to coincide with northeasterly surface winds to the
south of a surface high across Lower Michigan. While flow aloft will
be modest, the presence of a very dry, deep boundary layer may
promote enough downward momentum transport to support locally dry
and breezy conditions. The locally favorable surface meteorological
conditions atop dry fuels may support localized wildfire-spread
potential during the afternoon.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 281826
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 28 2021

SYNOPSIS: Multiple models (0Z GEFS, 0Z ECMWF, 0Z Canadian) generally favor a
transition to weak mid-level flow throughout the period, from the more
amplified pattern in week-1. Positive mid-level height anomalies continue to
be
anticipated for parts of the West at the beginning of week-2, supporting
lingering heat from the end of week-1. These models indicate mid-level high
pressure shifting westward and transitioning to mid-level low pressure near
the
middle to end of the period, which would decrease the risk for excessive heat
across the West. Above normal mid-level heights are also favored during week-2
across the northeastern contiguous U.S., with the pattern most likely to
support increased chances for excessive heat toward the end of week-2.
Mid-level low pressure forecast across the North-Central Pacific favors a
wetter and cooler pattern than normal for Alaska. No hazards are anticipated
for Alaska based on pre-defined hazards criteria.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central Great Basin,
Southwest, and Sierra Nevada range, Sat, Jun 5.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Central Great Basin, interior
California, and Southwest, Sat-Mon, Jun 5-7.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Central Appalachians, and Northeast, Wed-
Fri,
Jun 9-11.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of eastern Texas, the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast,
Sat-Tue, Jun 5-8.

Flooding possible for parts of southeastern Texas.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MAY 31 - FRIDAY JUNE 04:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!r7NmWjpvbgHtJsUq6reCOUDRvEoEJAbmnogGIc1-EsT_3TN_Ipwdn5QNQ3Cdl--RDyWMkeDi$

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 05 - FRIDAY JUNE 11: Above-normal mid-level heights are
predicted to linger from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2,
supporting a slight risk (>20% chance) of excessive heat for parts of the
Central Great Basin, interior California, and Southwest, June 5 to 7. An
embedded area of moderate risk (>40% chance) of excessive heat is posted
across
parts of the Central Great Basin, Southwest, and Sierra Nevada range for June
5. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show enhanced probabilities in
these highlighted areas of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile.
Temperatures across the Central Great Basin may exceed 90 deg F, while areas
across the Desert Southwest may exceed 105 deg F. The ongoing severe to
extreme
drought conditions being felt across the region are likely to exacerbate
heat-related impacts. Additionally, drought conditions in combination with
anticipated heat may support enhanced wildfire risk across parts of the West.
The National Interagency Fire Center forecast shows low to moderate potential
for significant fire potential for many parts of California, the Central
Basin,
and the Southwest on June 3, where dry, hot conditions are predicted for
week-2. A transition from mid-level ridging to troughing across the West by
the
middle of the period is anticipated to bring a moderation in temperatures.



Downstream, ensemble means from the aforementioned models continue to indicate
anomalously positive mid-level heights across the Northeast, Great Lakes, and
Mid-Atlantic throughout week-2. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
Central Appalachians, and Northeast, for the end of the period (June 9 to 11),
where the CPC excessive heat tool shows at least a 20% chance of heat index
values exceeding the 90th percentile. Although the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast
tools continue to show at least a 20% chance of temperatures exceeding the
85th
percentile but less than 20% chance of temperatures exceeding 90 deg F for the
northern portions of the highlighted area (the Northeast, Great Lakes, Central
Appalachians), the 6Z GEFS and 0Z ECMWF ensemble means indicate 500 hPa
heights
reaching 582 to 588 dm across this region, which could support temperatures
higher than those indicated in the reforecast tools. The 6Z deterministic GFS
indicates some of these areas reaching temperature anomalies potentially
exceeding 10 to 12 deg F above normal during the highlighted period.



Multiple models continue to show possible surface low formation and frontal
activity across the central CONUS. This pattern, combined with favored
southerly moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico, supports a slight risk of heavy
rainfall across parts of the South-Central and southeastern CONUS from the
beginning to middle of week-2. The uncalibrated 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean and
ECMWF reforecast tools continue to have a stronger signal for this heavy
precipitation risk compared to the GEFS counterparts. Despite these model
guidance differences, a broad area is highlighted across portions of eastern
Texas, the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians,
and Southeast, June 5 to 7 based on good run-to-run model consistency in the
ECMWF. The risk for possible flooding is limited to southeastern Texas where
the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service (AHPS) forecast flooding to
continue
into week-2.



Mid-level troughing is forecast over the North-Central Pacific, with
associated
surface low pressure depicted across Alaska. This pattern favors above normal
precipitation for week-2 across many parts of mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. However, precipitation amounts are not expected to reach pre-
defined
hazardous thresholds, and the increased cloud cover and precipitation supports
below-normal temperatures over much of the state during the period.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 28 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 03 - 07 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Bering Sea and the Aleutians, and ridging over the eastern North Pacific and
western North America. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the south-
central
CONUS, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the
northeastern CONUS. The manual blend of models forecasts positive 500-hPa
height anomalies across most of the northern CONUS. Slightly negative 500-hPa
height anomalies are forecast over the south-central CONUS, associated with
the
trough there. Southerly low-level surface flow is predicted into the central
and eastern CONUS, around surface high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

Negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely near to below normal
temperatures for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle as well as the
Aleutians. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced for the
western and northern CONUS as well as the East coast, under positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are most favored over the
south-central CONUS, as a trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse
the region, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and Bering Sea and associated onshore
flow lead to increased chances of near to above normal precipitation for
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted ridging over the
northwestern CONUS and positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the northern
tier lead to increased probabilities of near to below normal precipitation for
the West and the north-central CONUS. Increased probabilities of near to above
normal precipitation are indicated over the eastern Arizona, New Mexico, parts
of the Southern Plains and most of the eastern CONUS, ahead of a predicted
trough, and consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 05 - 11 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Troughing over the Bering Sea deamplifies relative
to the 6-10 day period. Cyclonic flow is forecast over the northwestern CONUS.
Above normal 500-hPa heights are favored over most of the northern CONUS.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean slightly
greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model
skill.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western and northern as
well as the eastern CONUS, (except for Washington, where below normal
temperatures are indicated due to the cyclonic flow), under positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are likely over south-central
CONUS, due to a shortwave trough traversing the region. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
consistent with the temperature consolidation tool.

Near to below normal precipitation is likely over the northwestern CONUS,
under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies associated with the predicted ridge. Chances
of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over much of the
south-central and southeastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems
associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly surface flow. Near
to
above normal precipitation is favored for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians,
while below normal precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle,
consistent with the most dynamical precipitation forecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Record highs likely in parts of the West next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a possibly closed
mid-upper low over the eastern U.S., with a surface low
pressure/frontal system in the western Atlantic spreading rain and
cool temperatures to parts of the East Coast. Meanwhile, periods
of troughing should affect the north-central U.S. southwestward
toward the Four Corners/Desert Southwest, leading to several
chances of rain and cooler than normal temperatures with abundant
cloud cover in central and southern portions of the Plains for the
first half of the week, shifting east as the week progresses. An
upper ridge along the West Coast will cause warm/hot and
potentially record-breaking temperatures for the Pacific Northwest
and northern California into the Great Basin.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The 00Z/06Z guidance cycle was in generally good agreement with
the pattern described above, but with typical differences in the
lower predictability details of the pattern. Most guidance shows
the eastern upper low as being closed on Sunday before rejoining
with the main flow by Monday, but the 06Z GFS was the exception.
Nevertheless, a multi-model deterministic blend was able to be
used for the early part of the medium range period, including the
00Z GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET, which also led to good continuity with
previous WPC forecasts. By Tuesday through Thursday, shortwaves
moving through the central CONUS trough had some spread amongst
guidance, and there was model variability with the potential for
energy to split off and form a separate upper low around Baja
California or not--which also affects the timing of the main
trough shifting eastward. Better agreement was seen with the upper
ridge affecting the West and then troughing sneaking into the
Pacific Northwest by Thursday. For the latter part of the forecast
period, trended toward the GEFS and EC ensemble means to reduce
reliance on any particular model's smaller scale features.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. Some areas could see
several inches of rainfall over the multi-day period, perhaps
adding to flooding concerns over areas that have seen above normal
rainfall recently. Rain and scattered thunderstorms are expected
to spread eastward into the Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys, but with less certainty on any areas of focused heavy
rainfall totals. These areas may welcome at least some of the
rainfall as little has been observed in the past week or two.

Along the East Coast, the offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure is likely to bring showers to the region early in the
week. Rainfall amounts will depend on the evolution of the system,
but the heaviest rain amounts still look to be offshore.
Nevertheless, at least some light rainfall is forecast for areas
east of the Appalachians with higher chances in the Northeast.
Meanwhile, the West Coast should see little to no precipitation
given the ridge, but coastal Washington may see some scattered
showers as the upper trough and cold front move in next Wednesday
into Thursday.

Cool temperatures in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Sunday will
moderate through the rest of the week as skies clear and high
pressure moves offshore. The Pacific Northwest can expect
temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next
Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels for parts of
the West Coast states. As the cold front comes ashore, the warm
temperatures will push through the Great Basin to the Divide next
Wed-Thu. The cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the
central/southern Plains and eastern slopes of the Rockies should
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal through much of next week.

...Record Warm Temperatures Likely Next Week Across the West...
...Heavy Rain Possible Mid-Week Across Southern/Central Plains...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Upper ridging over the West Coast and troughing over the Eastern
U.S. is expected to start the medium range period (May 31). This
pattern is forecast to evolve toward more quasi-zonal flow as the
western ridge breaks down with the approach of Gulf of Alaska and
Eastern Pacific energy dropping into the Pacific Northwest. At the
same time, energy ejecting out into the Plains is likely to carve
a more substantial trough over the central U.S. by the end of the
period.

The latest model guidance offers fairly good predictability and
agreement through the period. Early on, the GFS was noted to be
faster with shortwave energy across the Northeast. The other area
of model differences were later in the period (day 6/7) with the
central U.S. trough and how it progresses across the Great Lakes
and Northeast. Both the deterministic GFS and ECMWF suggest a
closed low forms but the GFS is much further north/northeast
(fast) with that feature compared to the ECMWF, which suggests the
low would remain over the MS River Valley. Although the WPC
preference was for a blend and heavily incorporated the ensemble
means for day 6/7, there are fairly notable sensible weather
differences for QPF, especially for the eastern U.S. as the closed
low could allow for a plume of deeper moisture to overspread the
area with more widespread/unsettled weather.  In the end, the WPC
blend preference maintained continuity given the forecast
uncertainty and lower confidence details.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains as Gulf of Mexico moisture intercepts a
slow moving cold front.  Some locations could see several inches
of rain with the best chance at this point from parts of northern
Texas into Oklahoma. Much of this area is already over saturated
due to above normal precipitation recently which would only
increase flooding concerns across the region. High pressure
building in behind the front may also aid low level upslope flow
to enhance convective development over the High Plains. Rain and
scattered thunderstorms are expected to spread eastward into the
Mississippi Valley, the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, and parts of the
East by mid to late next week ahead of the main trough, but with
less certainty on any areas of focused heavy rainfall totals.
Meanwhile, the West should stay dry beneath upper level ridging
with maybe some scattered precipitation as shortwave energy moves
across the region later next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 20 to 25
degrees above average could approach or exceed record values,
centered around next Tuesday/Wednesday. As the upper ridge weakens
and shifts, values may moderate a bit but still are expected to be
above normal across much of the West and into the northern Plains.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies the first half of the period, while the
Eastern U.S. sits near normal all next week.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms and a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains,
tonight...

...Below average temperatures across much of the central and
eastern United States, while eat builds over the West this
Memorial Day weekend...

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the Central
Appalachians, then southwestward to the Southern High Plains, will
move off the Atlantic Coast and the Gulf Coast by Saturday
evening.  Additionally, there is an upper-level low over the
Western Ohio Valley/Upper Great Lakes that will slowly move to the
Mid-Atlantic by Sunday evening.  The low will produce rain over
parts of the Ohio Valley into parts of the Northeast with embedded
thunderstorms over the Southern Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley and
Mid-Atlantic Saturday morning.  The rain will continue over the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with scattered rain showers over parts of
the Western Ohio Valley on Saturday. The rain will continue over
the Mid-Atlantic through Sunday evening. The upper-level low will
also keep maximum daytime temperatures low over the central and
eastern U.S., with several areas have of the Ohio Valley into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic having record-making low maximum daily
temperatures.

Along the western end of the front, showers and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Southern Plains through late Saturday
night.  The SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains through Saturday
morning. The hazards associated with the severe thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of
two-inch hail or larger over parts of the Southern Plains into the
Southern High Plains through Saturday morning.  The thunderstorms
will produce heavy rain. The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Southern Plains through
Saturday morning.  The heavy rain will create scattered areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being
the most vulnerable.  The severe thunderstorm threat will linger
over the Central/Southern High Plains through Monday. Likewise,
the excessive rainfall threat will continue over parts of the
Central/Southern High plains into Monday, too.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy moving across the Northern Tier
States will produce rain and thunderstorms over parts of the
Pacific Northwest/Northern Rockies through Friday night. On
Saturday, the area of rain and thunderstorms will move into the
Northern Central Plains and extend from the upper Mississippi
Valley to the Southern Plains on Sunday.

...Record warmth likely Tuesday into Thursday across parts of the
West...
...Locally heavy rain possible mid-week from the southern Plains
into the Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

A fairly amplified pattern should be in place to start the medium
range period as strong ridging holds over the West and broad
troughing is maintained from the Central to Eastern states. A
shortwave entering the Pacific Northwest around next Thursday
should kick the Western U.S. ridge into the Rockies while the
Central U.S. trough amplifies somewhat and heights build again
into the East. The trough will continue to move slowly eastward as
the pattern may become more zonal and progressive with another
round of shortwave energy entering the West Coast by next weekend.


The latest model guidance continues to show fairly good
predictability and agreement on the overall pattern through much
of the period. This allowed for a majority deterministic model
blend through day 5. Forecast uncertainty begins to increase later
in the period especially regarding timing and evolution in the
details of the Central U.S. trough as it lifts towards the
Northeast late next week. Some previous model runs hint at a
possible close low emerging from this trough, although the latest
GFS/CMC runs suggest a little weaker/more progressive feature with
possible southern stream energy attempting to hang back while
northern stream energy races into the Northeast. WPC prefers a
blend more towards the ensemble means by days 6-7, with some
contribution from the ECMWF which has shown a little bit better
run to run continuity. The approach also maintains good continuity
with the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall with be along and ahead of the Central
U.S. troughing as moisture pools along a weakening frontal
boundary. The best chance for moderate to locally heavy rainfall
will be from central Texas into Arkansas on Tuesday, where much of
this region has already seen much above normal rainfall in the
past couple of weeks. From Wednesday onward, the activity should
shift eastward into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and the Northeast
along a quasi-stationary front, with less certainty on any areas
of focused heavy rainfall totals. Meanwhile, the West should stay
dry beneath upper level ridging with maybe some scattered
precipitation as shortwave energy moves across the region later
next week.

Main concern for temperatures during the medium range period is
from California into the Great Basin where daytime highs 15-25F
above normal may meet or exceed daily records. Expect widespread
warm near record morning lows as well across this same region into
Thursday. As the upper ridge weakens and shifts east, values may
moderate a bit but still are expected to be above normal across
much of the West and into the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
The south-central U.S./High Plains will be below normal under
cloudy and stormy skies Tuesday and Wednesday, while the Eastern
and Southeast U.S. sits near normal the entire period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Sat May 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will prevail across the southern Plains, as broad,
cyclonic upper flow becomes established across the Southwest and
mid-level troughs progress across the northern Plains and East Coast
areas today. Surface low pressure across the Lower Colorado River
Valley may promote 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
coincident with 10-20% RH during the afternoon, necessitating
Elevated highlights given the dry fuels in place.

While precipitation or moist low-level conditions will limit
widespread major wildfire-spread threats across most areas east of
the Rockies, a few areas may briefly experience localized
wildfire-spread potential. Portions of central Georgia into the
Florida Peninsula may experience brief bouts of overlapping Elevated
surface winds/RH by afternoon peak heating, where fuels are dry.
Parts of Lower Michigan may also see dry, breezy northeasterly flow
atop dry fuels during the afternoon, though it is unclear how recent
precipitation across the region has impacted fuels.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Sat May 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs will continue progressing across the northern and
eastern CONUS while broad cyclonic upper flow persists across the
Southwest tomorrow. A weak surface low will continue to meander
across the Lower Colorado River Valley, promoting 15 mph sustained
southwesterly winds and 10-15% RH across western New Mexico during
the afternoon, where Elevated highlights have been introduced.
Otherwise, modest northwesterly mid-level flow will overspread a dry
boundary layer over North Dakota tomorrow afternoon, with downward
mixing promoting 15-20 mph sustained west-northwesterly surface
winds. RH may briefly reach Elevated criteria, but RH marginally
supportive of fire spread precludes Elevated highlights at this
time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1139 AM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

Expanded the elevated to include a broader region where downslope
flow in the lee of the Sierra and Cascades could yield a few hours
with winds of 15 to 20 mph amid relative humidity in the 8 to 12
percent range. 12Z guidance indicates the possibility that
thunderstorms may begin a few hours later than previously shown with
the better signal for storms in the 09-10Z timeframe. Therefore,
much of the thunderstorm activity may occur after 12Z, but the
threat still exists before 12Z and therefore the isolated dry
thunderstorm area remains warranted.

..Bentley.. 07/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is noted in early-morning water vapor imagery
off the coast of the Pacific Northwest, and is expected to slowly
move onshore over the next 24-36 hours. Lift associated with this
wave will introduce isolated thunderstorm chances to the Pacific
Northwest, and an increase in low-level winds will support a
regional fire weather concern for parts of northern CA/southern OR.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, recent rainfall and/or additional rain
chances today will mitigate any other robust fire weather concerns.

...Pacific Northwest...
00z regional soundings as well as recent GOES precipitable water
estimates suggests that PWAT values between 0.5-0.6 inches are
already in place across much of the Pacific Northwest. Furthermore,
steep mid-level lapse rates are noted for a few locations, and
additional cooling aloft with the approach of the upper-level wave
will help support around 100-250 J/kg MUCAPE by late this afternoon
and into the overnight hours. Lift and attendant thunderstorm
chances are expected to gradually increase from central/eastern OR
late today and spread north/northeastward through the overnight
hours. Recent hi-res guidance has struggled to show a strong
convective signal for today/tonight, possibly due to the minimal
instability expected, and this is yielding low confidence in storm
coverage. However, the synoptic forcing for ascent and antecedent
mid-level moisture suggest at least an isolated chance for dry
thunderstorms. Given very dry fuels across the region this potential
warranted an expansion of the risk area.

...Northern California and southern Oregon...
Afternoon relative humidity values are forecast to once again fall
into the single digits to low teens amid deep boundary-layer mixing.
Although sustained winds will generally remain around 15 mph,
increasing boundary-layer flow will support frequent gusts between
20-25 mph. Fuels across this region remain dry per recent fuel
analyses and ongoing fire activity. As such, elevated conditions are
expected, and brief/localized critical conditions are possible.

...Southern California Coast...
Northerly winds at around 850 mb are expected to gradually increase
during the overnight hours. This may augment downslope winds for
portions of coastal southern California where warm temperatures
during the day will help cure fuels. Overnight RH recoveries are
expected to be modest, and locations that experience downslope
warming/drying may see periods of elevated fire weather conditions
tonight through early Wednesday morning.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 06 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to be centered across the
northwestern lower 48 at the beginning of the period, shifting eastward to =
the
North-Central contiguous U.S. by the middle of week-2. This pattern is
expected
to continue elevated chances for excessive heat across parts of the West at
the
beginning of week-2, shifting to the central part of the lower 48 by the
middle
of the period. A closed surface low is anticipated to form near the Alaska
Panhandle from the beginning to middle of week-2, which could bring wet
weather
to southern portions of the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Great Basin, Southwest, Paci=
fic
Northwest and California, Wed-Thu, Jul 14-15.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Great Plains, Rockies, Great
Basin, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and Southwest, Wed-Tue, Jul 14-=

FOR WEDNESDAY JULY 14 - TUESDAY JULY 20: Mid-level ridging centered over th=
e
northwestern CONUS at the beginning of week-2 is anticipated to shift eastw=
ard
to the North-Central CONUS by the middle of the period. The 0Z GEFS ensembl=
e
mean indicates higher amplitude ridging that is more expansive across the
CONUS
compared to the 0Z ECMWF, with an area of 500 hPa heights reaching 594 dm o=
ver
the Four Corners towards the end of the period, which is not seen in the
ECMWF.
This pattern difference translates to the GEFS reforecast tool showing a
broader area of maximum temperatures reaching excessive heat criteria,
compared
to the ECMWF reforecast tool. The area highlighted for enhanced risk for
excessive heat includes regions across the Southwest and Central Plains, wh=
ich
is mainly favored in the GEFS reforecast tool since the week-2 mean
consolidation tool shows weights favored for the GEFS. The ECMWF reforecast
tool does show some agreement with some of these regions across the Southwe=
st,
although only towards the end of the period. Given these model differences,=
 a
broad area of slight risk of excessive heat is posted for parts of the Grea=
t
Basin, Southwest, Pacific Northwest and California, July 14 to 15, and the
Great Plains, Rockies, Great Basin, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, an=
d
Southwest throughout week-2. Highlighted excessive heat risk areas may
experience maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F =
(90
Deg F in higher elevation areas and 100 Deg F across the southwestern CONUS=
).
Triple digit temperatures are possible across some parts of the higher
elevations across the West, where combined with below normal precipitation
predominately favored during week-2, is likely to exacerbate ongoing modera=
te
(D1) to extreme drought (D4) conditions being felt throughout this part of =
the
country. Heat-driven impacts expected also include locally elevated fire
weather conditions as well as direct health risks for human and animal
populations across the highlighted regions. The GEFS reforecast tool also
shows
at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
and
95 deg F over parts of the southeastern CONUS. However, this is not seen in
the
ECMWF reforecast tool, and therefore not included in an excessive heat risk=
.



The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means indicate a shortwave trough
forming over the Midwest at the beginning of the period, moving eastward
during
week-2. This pattern favors surface low formation and frontal activity acro=
ss
the region, and increased chances for rainfall. A slight risk for heavy
precipitation is highlighted today due to good run to run model consistency=
 in
the ECMWF reforecast tool, for parts of the Upper and Middle Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Central Plains, July 14 to 16, where =
the
ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall tot=
als
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch. Similar to yesterday, the GEFS
reforecast tool has a weaker signal than the ECMWF across the aforementione=
d
regions, limiting totals to less than one inch. Heavy rainfall could suppor=
t
increased chances for localized flooding across parts of Illinois, especial=
ly
the Illinois River, which is already experiencing flood conditions and
forecast
to receive additional heavy rainfall during week-1.



Surface high pressure is forecast to build across the northeastern Pacific,
into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while surface low pressure may form
across
California and the Great Basin during week-2. This pattern supports increas=
ed
chances for a tight pressure gradient across northwestern California and
resulting episodes of high winds. A slight risk for episodes of high winds =
is
posted across coastal portions of Northern California for the entirety of
week-2, where both the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.



Models generally favor mid-level ridging to be located to north of the Four
Corners region during week-2, with the 0Z GEFS ensemble mean showing an are=
a
of
500 hPa reaching 594 dm over the northern half of the Four Corners region b=
y
the end of the period. Thermal low pressure may form over Baja California
during week-2, which could support enhanced moisture flow from the Gulf of
California into parts of the Southwest. Both reforecast tools and the
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day totals
exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch in a 3-day period during
week-2,
with some differences regarding the specific period most likely to have
elevated precipitation. A possible flood risk area is maintained in today's
outlook for parts of Arizona and New Mexico.



A mid-level closed surface low is forecast to form near the Alaska Panhandl=
e
from the beginning to middle of week-2, with mid-level ridging anticipated
elsewhere across the state. This mid-level low may support the formation of=
 a
storm over the Gulf of Alaska, favoring increased chances for precipitation
across parts of southern Alaska, including the Alaska Panhandle. The 6Z
deterministic GFS indicates the greatest likelihood for localized heavier
rainfall totals south of the Alaska Range. Both reforecast tools do not
indicate any areas reaching hazards criteria at this time, precluding a
related
heavy precipitation hazard from being designated at this time.

...There is a heavy rain threat this weekend over the Midwest,
which had a recent period of heavy rain...

No significant changes were needed for today's medium range
forecast. The 00Z/06Z cycle of model guidance stayed consistent
with previous runs, indicating good predictability for the overall
pattern, but still variations in strength and timing of the
shortwave entering the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia over the
weekend. Attempted to stick with a middle ground approach for the
feature, excluding the 00Z CMC as it was out of phase. The main
hazards in the medium range remain heavy rain and severe weather
across the Midwest for Friday into the weekend, as well as
persistent above normal temperatures in the West. See the previous
discussion below for more details.

...Previous Discussion...

...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday
potentially through Monday. The upper ridge over the Great
Basin/Desert Southwest will strengthen in the wake of the
ridge-riding trough and intensify the ongoing heat wave across The
West. The initial shortwave trough over the interior Northeast,
which will direct Elsa remnants off the Northeastern Seaboard on
Friday, will push a weak cold front through the Northeast with the
tailing front over the Midwest lifting back as a warm front ahead
of the ridge-riding shortwave trough over the weekend. An upper
level trough lingers over northern Mexico, but most of the
associated rain should be contained south of the Rio Grande.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

There is good agreement in the most recent guidance with the
ridge-riding shortwave trough that stalls over the Upper Midwest
this weekend, with the departure of Elsa off the Northeastern
Seaboard Friday, and with the upper trough/low lingering just
southwest of Texas this weekend into next week. The main
difference in guidance now is a second ridge riding shortwave
trough pushing east into southern BC around a Gulf of Alaska low
Saturday night or Sunday. The 18Z GFS is the slowest solution with
this feature Saturday evening, though the 00Z GFS has sped up
again and is now similar to the 12Z UKMET for timing which is a
little ways behind the 12Z CMC/ECMWF which are to the BC/Alberta
border by 12Z Sunday. The heavy rain threat associated with an
upper low/trough southwest of Texas looks to mainly end by Friday
with the threat pushing south of the Rio Grande. The 12Z CMC is a
bit farther north with the feature and is now an outlier solution
with a heavy rain threat continuing through the weekend for far
southern Texas. Therefore, a general deterministic model blend was
used through Day 5 (with less CMC by Day 4) with increasing use of
the GEFS/ECENS means for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The cold front moving through the Northeast Friday should bring an
area of modest to perhaps heavier rain to upstate New York and the
Adirondacks/North Country before pushing off the coast (with
effects from Elsa remnants remaining off the Northeastern
Seaboard). The ridge-riding trough forecast to reach the Upper
Midwest by Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced moisture and
should result in significant rainfall for the northern Plains
through the Corn Belt to the western Great Lakes as the system
becomes blocked/stalls. The axis of heaviest rain may set up near
northern Missouri/north-central Illinois into northern Indiana
which had a rather wet second half of June and is still
experienced main-stem river flooding.

The heat wave over a significant portion of The West will shift
slightly west this weekend in the wake of the ridge-riding trough.
The Coast Ranges, Central Valley of California, Great Basin, and
northern Rockies/Columbian Basin should all see highs 10-15F above
normal each day with locally higher readings possible. Meanwhile
the strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge will
promote a hotter trend over interior locations of California where
temperatures will climb into the 100s and 110s. Several daily high
temperature records are under threat each day primarily over the
western Great Basin through interior California. The southern High
Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of
the week due to cloudiness and light to moderate rain. The Midwest
and Great Lakes will see below normal highs over the weekend due
to rainfall.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue July 06 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 12 - 16 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast subtropical ridging acr=
oss
the southwestern and southeastern CONUS. A weakness in this subtropical
ridging
is predicted over the central CONUS, punctuated by a mean trough forecast o=
ver
the western Great Lakes. Ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
likely for the northeastern CONUS ahead of this trough. Ensemble means from
the
GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models show a persistent trough or closed low ove=
r
the Gulf of Alaska near the Alaska Panhandle. Above normal heights are
generally forecast farther to the north and west across most of Mainland
Alaska
and the Aleutians.

Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across mu=
ch
of the West and Northern Plains, under a predicted ridge and positive 500-h=
Pa
height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored from the Southern
Plains to parts of the Southwest underneath a predicted weakness in
subtropical
ridging. Above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic states ahead of a mean trough forecast over the western Great
Lakes. Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska
Panhandle associated with a persistent mid-level trough or closed low forec=
ast
over the eastern Gulf of Alaska. Above normal temperature probabilities are
elevated across much of Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal
heights.

Below normal precipitation is favored for the eastern Aleutians and across
much
of Mainland Alaska, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Persistent
troughing forecast over the Gulf of Alaska leads to elevated chances of abo=
ve
normal precipitation across the Alaska Panhandle. Below normal precipitatio=
n
is
likely for the northwestern CONUS into the Northern Plains, under a predict=
ed
ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored from the Southwest to the
Southern
Plains underneath a predicted weakness in the subtropical ridging. Enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation extend farther to the north and
East from the Mississippi Valley to the Northeast, associated with a mean
trough predicted over the east-central CONUS. Conversely, a drier than norm=
al
pattern is likely for parts of the Southeast underneath predicted subtropic=
al
ridging.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 25% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on
Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 14 - 20 2021

During the week 2 period, 500-hPa ridging across the West is forecast to bu=
ild
northeastward over the Northern Plains. In its wake, heights are generally
predicted to lower across the Pacific Northwest, relative to the 6-10 day
period. A mean trough is forecast to shift slightly eastward across the Gre=
at
Lakes while a weakness in the subtropical ridge is forecast to persist over
the
southern High Plains. A trough and associated below normal heights are
forecast
to persist near the Alaska Panhandle throughout most of week-2. Above norma=
l
heights are favored across the Mainland ahead of a developing trough foreca=
st
near the Bering Strait.

Above normal temperatures are favored to persist across much of the West.
However, the greatest confidence for increased heat shifts eastward to the
Northern Rockies and High Plains with time as a cooling trend is favored
across
the Pacific Northwest. A predicted weakness in subtropical ridging leads to
slightly increased odds of below normal temperatures for the Southern Plain=
s
westward to parts of the Southwest. Above normal temperatures remain likely
across the Eastern Seaboard ahead of a trough predicted over the Great Lake=
s.
Above normal temperatures are also favored for much of Mainland Alaska unde=
r
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored fo=
r
the Alaska Panhandle near a predicted closed low.

Below normal precipitation continues to be likely for much of the West and
Northern Plains as an expansive ridge is forecast to shift eastward. Mean
troughing predicted ahead of this ridge leads to elevated probabilities of
above normal precipitation for the Ohio Valley as well as parts of the Midd=
le
Mississippi Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, and eastern Great Lakes. Below
normal precipitation is slightly favored farther to the south, across much =
of
the Gulf Coast Region, due to mean surface high pressure. Probabilities of
above normal precipitation are slightly elevated for parts of the Southwest
and
southern High Plains due to the potential advection of monsoonal moisture.
Above normal precipitation remains favored for much of the Alaska Panhandle
near persistent troughing. As a separate trough is forecast to develop near
the
Bering Strait during week-2, the overall pattern is likely to feature less
dryness for much of Mainland Alaska relative to the 6 to 10 day period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 30=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good agreement among dynamical model guidance.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Damaging winds, dangerous storm surge, and heavy rainfall
likely across the west coast of Florida as Elsa moves through the
region this evening, with tropical storm conditions extending into
the Southeast on Wednesday and coastal Mid-Atlantic by Thursday...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding likely across South Texas
over the next few days...

...Excessive heat continues throughout parts of the Northwest and
Great Basin, as well as the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...

...Severe weather and locally heavy rain possible for parts of the
Upper Midwest this evening and over the Northeast through
Thursday...

As of this afternoon, the center of Tropical Storm Elsa was
located off the coast of southwest Florida and was producing
locally heavy rain across south-central Florida and along
Florida's Gulf Coast regions. Elsa is forecast to strengthen into
a hurricane by tonight and make landfall on Wednesday morning near
the Big Bend of Florida. Potentially life-threatening storm surge
is possible along the west coast of Florida tonight and Wednesday,
with hurricane conditions possible as well. Rainfall amounts of 2
to 4 inches, with locally higher totals up to 6 inches, could
produce instances of flash flooding throughout the western half of
the Florida Peninsula before gradually clearing by Wednesday
night. A few isolated tornadoes cannot be ruled out as well. Elsa
is then forecast to slowly weaken over the Southeast on Wednesday
and early Thursday, before restrengthening as it nears southeast
Virginia on Thursday night. Heavy rain is expected to be the main
hazard for these areas, as upwards of 8 inches of rain could fall
between southeast Georgia and the Lowcountry of South Carolina.

Heavy rain is also a concern for much of South Texas due to
multiple rounds of slow-moving showers and thunderstorms expected
to impact the region over the next few days. The combination of
extremely high atmospheric moisture content and a very stagnant
airmass will lead to thunderstorms producing several inches of
rain in a short period of time. Rainfall totals between tonight
and Friday morning could approach 5 to 10 inches. This will likely
lead to numerous flash flood events, with significant flooding
possible. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall and
Flash Flood Watches have been issued for South Texas, specifically
near the middle and lower Texas Coast.

Isolated severe thunderstorms and locally heavy rain is also
forecast to impact parts of the Upper Midwest today and much of
the Northeast through the end of this week. An area of low
pressure and associated cold front is forecast to slowly push
through the Midwest and eventually stall over the Lower Great
Lakes and Northeast on Thursday. This will help spark
thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind gusts and locally
heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather over
the Northeast and throughout southern Minnesota/central Wisconsin
for tonight. Damaging wind gusts are the main concern for both
regions, with a few isolated tornadoes possible over the Upper
Midwest. The threat of a few severe thunderstorms also exists this
evening over the Northern High Plains as well. By Wednesday and
Thursday, the majority of the thunderstorm activity is expected to
shift into the Great Lakes and Northeast, where isolated severe
thunderstorms and flash flooding will remain possible.

Midsummer heat continues for parts of the Northwest, Great Basin,
Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic. Starting with the western U.S., high
temperatures into the upper-90s and low-100s are forecast
throughout interior Washington and Oregon, extending across much
of the Great Basin. A few daily high temperature records could
break, centered around Idaho and Nevada on Wednesday. Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories have been issued for parts of
Utah, Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon. The hot and dry conditions may
also lead to an elevated fire weather risk this week; therefore,
Red Flag Warnings scatter the region as well. For the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic, oppressive heat is expected to continue into
Wednesday. This section of the country is forecast to be
sandwiched between an approaching cold front from the
west-northwest and Tropical Storm Elsa to the south. High
temperatures are forecast to reach the low-to-mid 90s, but heat
indices into the low triple digits will make it feel even hotter.
Heat Advisories are in effect.

0256 PM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

Expanded the elevated area into central Idaho and southward into
south-central Nevada based on the latest forecast guidance.
Considered a scattered dry thunderstorm area for northern
Washington, but confidence was not quite high enough for scattered
lightning coverage.

..Bentley.. 07/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Tue Jul 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently approaching the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to translate across the northern Rockies through the day
Wednesday. This will bring stronger mid-level flow and isolated to
scattered thunderstorm chances across the northern Great Basin,
northern Rockies, and parts of the Pacific Northwest. With dry fuels
already in place, this will introduce fire weather concerns to the
region.

...Columbia Basin...
Mid-level winds are forecast to turn more westerly in the wake of a
weak cold frontal passage by mid to late afternoon. Additionally, a
deepening trough to the east of the Basin will tighten the
background surface pressure gradient. As a result, sustained
downslope winds between 15-20 mph are expected with frequent gusts
up to 25 mph likely. Winds may be stronger closer to terrain
features with some guidance suggesting gusts upwards of 30 mph are
possible. Despite the weak cold intrusion, diurnal warming will
support RH reductions down to 15-20%, supporting elevated fire
weather conditions.

...Northern Great Basin...
The synoptic features driving the elevated fire weather threat
across the Pacific Northwest will also drive fire weather concerns
for the northern Great Basin. Increasing mid-level flow within a
deeply mixed boundary layer will support a broad swath of 15-20 mph
winds - especially through the Snake River Valley of
southern/southeast ID where terrain influences will increase the
probability of sustained winds above 15 mph. Given dry conditions
and forecast RH values between 10-15%, elevated conditions appear
likely from northwest NV into southern ID.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated thunderstorms may be ongoing at the start of the period
early Wednesday morning from northeast OR into eastern WA.
Thunderstorm coverage will likely increase through the day as lift
associated with the upper-level trough overspreads higher quality
moisture to the east. Recent hi-res ensemble guidance shows a
wetting rainfall signal across western MT, suggesting that a
transition zone from primarily isolated dry thunderstorms to
scattered wet thunderstorms may exist across the WA/ID/MT region.
Forecast soundings from this area feature 0.6-0.8 inch PWAT values
supporting 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE rooted above dry, well-mixed boundary
layers - suggesting a mixture of dry and wet thunderstorms and
supporting the idea of a possible transition zone. Considering the
dry fuels already in place, the dry thunderstorm risk area is
maintained, though some refinements are possible as the
precipitation forecast becomes clearer.

...There is a heavy rain threat this weekend over the Midwest,
which had a recent period of heavy rain...

No significant changes were needed for today's medium range
forecast. The 00Z/06Z cycle of model guidance stayed consistent
with previous runs, indicating good predictability for the overall
pattern, but still variations in strength and timing of the
shortwave entering the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia over the
weekend. Attempted to stick with a middle ground approach for the
feature, excluding the 00Z CMC as it was out of phase. The main
hazards in the medium range remain heavy rain and severe weather
across the Midwest for Friday into the weekend, as well as
persistent above normal temperatures in the West. See the previous
discussion below for more details.

Tate

...Previous Discussion...

...Overview...

The western CONUS ridge/eastern mean trough pattern will amplify
this weekend as a shortwave trough from the Pacific rounds the
ridge before stalling over the Upper Mississippi Valley Saturday
potentially through Monday. The upper ridge over the Great
Basin/Desert Southwest will strengthen in the wake of the
ridge-riding trough and intensify the ongoing heat wave across The
West. The initial shortwave trough over the interior Northeast,
which will direct Elsa remnants off the Northeastern Seaboard on
Friday, will push a weak cold front through the Northeast with the
tailing front over the Midwest lifting back as a warm front ahead
of the ridge-riding shortwave trough over the weekend. An upper
level trough lingers over northern Mexico, but most of the
associated rain should be contained south of the Rio Grande.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

There is good agreement in the most recent guidance with the
ridge-riding shortwave trough that stalls over the Upper Midwest
this weekend, with the departure of Elsa off the Northeastern
Seaboard Friday, and with the upper trough/low lingering just
southwest of Texas this weekend into next week. The main
difference in guidance now is a second ridge riding shortwave
trough pushing east into southern BC around a Gulf of Alaska low
Saturday night or Sunday. The 18Z GFS is the slowest solution with
this feature Saturday evening, though the 00Z GFS has sped up
again and is now similar to the 12Z UKMET for timing which is a
little ways behind the 12Z CMC/ECMWF which are to the BC/Alberta
border by 12Z Sunday. The heavy rain threat associated with an
upper low/trough southwest of Texas looks to mainly end by Friday
with the threat pushing south of the Rio Grande. The 12Z CMC is a
bit farther north with the feature and is now an outlier solution
with a heavy rain threat continuing through the weekend for far
southern Texas. Therefore, a general deterministic model blend was
used through Day 5 (with less CMC by Day 4) with increasing use of
the GEFS/ECENS means for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The cold front moving through the Northeast Friday should bring an
area of modest to perhaps heavier rain to upstate New York and the
Adirondacks/North Country before pushing off the coast (with
effects from Elsa remnants remaining off the Northeastern
Seaboard). The ridge-riding trough forecast to reach the Upper
Midwest by Saturday will have access to Gulf-sourced moisture and
should result in significant rainfall for the northern Plains
through the Corn Belt to the western Great Lakes as the system
becomes blocked/stalls. The axis of heaviest rain may set up near
northern Missouri/north-central Illinois into northern Indiana
which had a rather wet second half of June and is still
experienced main-stem river flooding.

The heat wave over a significant portion of The West will shift
slightly west this weekend in the wake of the ridge-riding trough.
The Coast Ranges, Central Valley of California, Great Basin, and
northern Rockies/Columbian Basin should all see highs 10-15F above
normal each day with locally higher readings possible. Meanwhile
the strengthening and westward expansion of the upper ridge will
promote a hotter trend over interior locations of California where
temperatures will climb into the 100s and 110s. Several daily high
temperature records are under threat each day primarily over the
western Great Basin through interior California. The southern High
Plains/Texas will likely see highs 5-12F below average for most of
the week due to cloudiness and light to moderate rain. The Midwest
and Great Lakes will see below normal highs over the weekend due
to rainfall.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Wed Jul 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level wave currently just off the OR/WA coast will continue
to support isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the Northwest
and northern Rockies today. Increasing low and mid-level flow
associated with the wave combined with antecedent hot/dry conditions
and receptive fuels will drive additional fire weather concerns
across the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin.

...Pacific Northwest/Northern Rockies...
A few isolated and transient thunderstorms are noted in
early-morning satellite and lightning data across eastern OR and far
western ID ahead of the approaching wave. The 00z sounding from BOI
captures the thermodynamic environment well, featuring a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer under mid-level moisture and elevated
instability. The plume of mid-level moisture sampled by the sounding
is noted in recent GOES PWAT imagery, and is forecast to continue
northeastward into eastern WA, ID, and western MT over the next 24
hours. Thunderstorm chances will increase early this morning through
the evening hours with isolated dry thunderstorms likely across
eastern WA/OR and ID early today before transitioning to
predominantly wet thunderstorms across western MT by late
afternoon/early evening. An area of scattered dry thunderstorms is
possible across northern ID and along the ID/MT border, but forecast
PWAT values between 0.6-0.8 inches hint at a possible mix of dry/wet
thunderstorms, which precludes a scattered risk area for this
outlook.

...Columbia Basin...
The passage of weak cold front through the day will turn winds more
westerly by mid/late afternoon. The deepening of a lee trough across
the northern Rockies will also help tighten the surface pressure
gradient, resulting in sustained winds near 15 mph. Zonal downslope
winds will aid in drying/warming across the Columbia Basin, and
support wind gusts up to 25-35 mph - especially closer to any
terrain features. Given very dry fuels in place across the region,
elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions are expected.

...Great Basin...
Surface winds will increase across the western Great Basin as well
this afternoon as the surface low deepens to the northeast. A broad
swath of 15 mph winds is expected with embedded areas of stronger
winds closer to 20 mph near terrain features such as in the lee of
the Sierra Nevada and within the Snake River Valley in southern ID.
Single digit to low teen RH values are expected, and fuels across
the region are generally receptive. Elevated fire weather conditions
are likely, and brief/localized critical conditions are possible.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
207 AM EDT Wed Jul 07 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jul 10 2021 - 12Z Wed Jul 14 2021

...Overview...

An amplified western ridge/eastern trough pattern will be in place
by Saturday morning as an upper trough digs down the northern
Plains closed off into a low near the MO/IA border Saturday night.
This low then persists/drifts northeast to the Great Lakes through
Monday as shortwaves spread across the Northwest. The western
ridge/high center continues to drift west to central CA through
Saturday night before drifting southeast to the lower CO River
Basin into the middle of next week. The slow motion of the pattern
favors repeating rain ahead of the Midwest low this weekend while
the heat wave in the west persists under high pressure.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

There is good agreement among global deterministic guidance on the
over all ridge/trough pattern across the CONUS this weekend into
next week, but there are differences in the details of the Midwest
low strength and motion. The 18Z and now 00Z is weaker with the
trough crossing the northern Plains on Saturday and therefore
keeps an open trough and a more eastward motion than the deeper,
more closed and therefore slower 12Z ECMWF and 12Z and now 00Z
UKMET. The 12Z CMC was unavailable again for analysis/use in our
blend. Therefore, more weight was given to the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET in
the blend through Day 5. Given that low confidence shortwave
activity in the Northwest/southwest Canada dominates the pattern
early next week, a heavier than recent usage of the ECENS/GEFS
ensemble means was used for Days 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The trough digging down the northern Plains Saturday will have
access to Gulf-sourced moisture and should result in significant
rainfall for the northern Plains through the Corn Belt to the
western Great Lakes as the system becomes blocked/stalls. The axis
of heaviest rain on Saturday looks to be over a similar area to
the rain on Friday night over IA/northern MO and across central
IL/IN. This potential for a quick repeat over areas that both had
rain the night before and had a rather wet second half of June
sets up a flooding threat.

The ongoing heat wave continues for the Great Basin to the Coastal
Ranges and lower CO River Basin this weekend and into next week
with temperatures 10-15F above normal each day with locally higher
readings possible. Several daily high temperature records are
under threat each day primarily over the western Great Basin
through interior California to Arizona. Relief from the heat would
come from a low shifting south from the Gulf of Alaska Monday
which should start causing height falls over the Pacific Northwest
by midweek. Highs 5-10F below average will spread down the
northern to central Plains over the weekend with clouds/rain and
Texas will remain below average for highs under continued
cloudy/rainy conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Wed Jul 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA INTO SOUTHEASTERN
IDAHO...

...Synopsis...
A second upper-level impulse is expected to move through the Pacific
Northwest/northern Great Basin on the heels of today's disturbance.
Increasing low and mid-level flow over the Great Basin and northern
Rockies will introduce regional fire weather concerns given the
antecedent dry conditions and receptive fuels. A few isolated dry
thunderstorms will also be possible late Thursday afternoon across
parts of the northern/central Rockies.

...Great Basin...
Surface pressure falls are expected through the day across the
northern Great Basin as the upper-level wave approaches the region
with surface winds increasing to 15-20 mph in response. A belt of
stronger mid-level flow should become established from roughly
northern CA into southeast ID by late afternoon. Deep boundary-layer
mixing will help downward transport of 25-35 mph winds and support a
corridor of critical wind speeds. Recent ensemble guidance suggests
this corridor is most likely to occur from northwest NV into
southeast ID, though 20+ mph winds may occur just outside of this
strip and in proximity to any terrain features. With RH values in
the teens likely and receptive fuels in place, critical fire weather
conditions are expected within this corridor surrounded by elevated,
to perhaps briefly critical, conditions.

...Southern Montana...
A surface trough/weak cold front is expected to progress southward
along the northern High Plains through the day Thursday. Breezy
post-frontal winds up to 15 mph are likely with gusts up to 20-25
mph possible depending on the depth of boundary-layer mixing. Dry
continental air and diurnal warming/mixing will support RH values in
the teens across the region. Although some areas have received
recent rainfall, the latest fuel analyses indicate fine fuel
moisture is generally below 10%, which should be sufficient for at
least a low-end fire weather concern. The coverage of elevated
conditions is uncertain due to spread in short and medium range
guidance, so further refinement to the risk area is possible in
subsequent updates.

...Central Rockies...
Forecast soundings from WY and northwest CO show well-mixed boundary
layers under a plume of mid-level moisture that may support modest,
but sufficient, instability for dry thunderstorms. The combination
of lift ahead of the wave and orographic ascent will favor isolated
storm coverage, and fuels across this region are generally
receptive. Isolated to scattered convection is possible further
south and east across central CO and eastern WY, but rainfall across
these regions has mitigated fuel readiness.

...Tropical Storm conditions will continue across parts of Florida
on Wednesday, and into eastern Georgia and the Carolinas by
Thursday...

...High risk for excessive rainfall and significant flash flooding
across portions of the middle and lower Texas Coast...

...Excessive heat continues throughout much of the West, as well
as for the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday...

...Heavy rain possible for parts of the Northeast on Thursday...

Tropical Storm Elsa, currently located just west of Tampa Bay, FL,
is forecast to continue moving towards the north-northeast with a
landfall near the Big Bend of Florida early Wednesday. Elsa will
make her way across eastern portions of Georgia and the Carolinas
late Wednesday and Thursday before racing northeastward along the
East Coast into Friday. Damaging winds, heavy rainfall, dangerous
storm surge, and a few tornadoes are expected along the path of
Elsa. As much as 6 inches of rain, and locally higher amounts, are
possible associated with Elsa which may result in considerable
flash and urban flooding across parts of Florida and into the
Southeast. Please refer to the National Hurricane Center for the
latest on Tropical Storm Elsa.

An upper level disturbance combined with a lingering surface
boundary will bring heavy to significant rainfall to parts of
south Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast Wednesday and Thursday. As
much as 5 to 10 inches of rain is possible across this region with
a moderate to high risk of excessive rainfall and flash flooding
along the middle and lower Texas coast. Farther north, a frontal
boundary sliding eastward across the Midwest and into the
Northeast will support showers and thunderstorms, capable of
producing heavy rainfall and/or severe weather, especially as the
front moves across the Northeast on Thursday and begins to
interact with moisture from Elsa. The western portion of this
boundary could also bring the threat for severe thunderstorms to
parts of central Montana on Wednesday.

Excessive heat continues across much of the Western U.S. with
daytime highs well into the 90s and lower 100s into the end of the
week and more records possible. Excessive heat warnings, watches,
and heat advisories remain in effect across central California,
the Southwest, and parts of the central/northern Great Basin.
Across parts of the Northwest, the heat and dry conditions
combined may lead to an elevated to critical risk for fire weather
Wednesday and Thursday with Red Flag Warnings in effect for
eastern Washington, northern Idaho, and northeast Oregon. The
mid-Atlantic into southern New England will deal with another day
of above normal temperatures on Wednesday before values moderate
back towards normal or even slightly below normal as a cold front
traverses the region and Elsa lifts northward.

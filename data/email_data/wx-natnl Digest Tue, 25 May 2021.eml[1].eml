Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1025 AM CDT Mon May 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Morning surface observations show
very dry, but nearly calm conditions across the Southwest.
Water-vapor imagery reveals a subtle shortwave trough moving across
northwest Mexico, which should lead to increasing winds and areas of
elevated conditions across central to northeast NM this afternoon.
However, recent forecasts and fuel analysis continue to suggest
minimal overlap of stronger winds with sufficiently dry fuels. Other
forecast concerns detailed in the previous discussion (below) remain
on track.

..Moore.. 05/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Mon May 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough will continue to lift northeast into the
northern Plains and southern Canada. Upper-level winds will be much
weaker over areas with dry fuels today. Locally elevated fire
weather conditions do appear possible in parts of New Mexico. A weak
shortwave trough may help to boost surface winds in central and
northeastern portions of the state. Fuels in northeastern New Mexico
are not receptive and conditions appear too brief in
central/southern areas.

Dry conditions will remain across the Florida Peninsula, given how
dry fuels are, even light winds may pose a elevated threat for
wildfire spread. However, the overall synoptic pattern suggests
areas of 10-15 mph winds will be localized and brief.

There is some potential for lightning in portions of Oregon. Fuel
conditions are generally marginal and so the overall risk for
lightning ignitions appears low at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1236 PM EDT Mon May 24 2021

Valid 12Z Thu May 27 2021 - 12Z Mon May 31 2021

...Overview...

A pair of shortwave troughs will track east over the northern tier
of the CONUS through Monday while the next trough digs down the
West Coast, closing off southern California Sunday as the pattern
becomes less progressive with ridging up the central Plains.
Rainfall will be focused along a cold front from the central
Plains to the East Coast on Friday, sagging south to the Gulf
Coast with the front Saturday before focusing ahead of the western
trough/low over the central Plains Sunday/Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic models continue to depict reasonable
clustering for the Thu-Sat period as low pressure along the front
moves from the Plains to the Ohio Valley to a developing cold air
damming wedge over the Mid-Atlantic. By then, uncertainty
increases with a southern stream shortwave through Texas/lower MS
Valley as well as the unfolding western trough/low and potential
stalling troughing along the East Coast. Did a typical trend
toward a majority ensemble blend (GEFS/ECENS) with a small
weighting of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian deterministic runs to offer
just a bit of detail where appropriate. Blended the 12Z/13Z
National Blend of Models with ECMWF/GFS/ECENS/GEFS for
temperatures/PoPs/QPF.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period are Thursday
night/Friday ahead of an eastward moving low from the central
Plains to the Corn Belt eastward to the central Appalachians along
a wavy frontal boundary with a potential area of organized and
moderate to heavy rain shifting across the mid/lower Mississippi
Valley into the Ohio Valley. Areas in the Mid-Atlantic look to see
light/modest showers in the developing cold air damming. Then,
return flow up the Plains meets the next cold front with potential
repeating rain over the central Plains Sunday/Monday.

Temperatures will be cool, 10 to 15 degrees below normal, in the
northern Plains to Upper Midwest to northeast Friday/Saturday,
expanding south down the Mid-Atlantic Saturday with the cold air
damming. Meanwhile hot conditions, 10 to 15 degrees above normal
and near records, persist in the Southeast until the cold frontal
passage Saturday into Sunday. For the rest of the Memorial Day
weekend, expect near to slightly below normal temperatures east of
the Rockies, while the Pacific Northwest looks to see a warming
trend with temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal by Memorial
Day.

FXUS21 KWNC 241828
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical model guidance depicts a generally stable week-2 pattern
over North America, with anomalous mid-level high pressure forecast across the
northwestern contiguous U.S. This favors above normal temperatures for much of
the West, with some interior areas possibly reaching excessive heat criteria
early in the period. Weaker amplification is forecast downstream over the
central CONUS, with enhanced precipitation chances across portions of the
Great
Plains and Mississippi Valley. Mid-level low pressure forecast across the
North
Central Pacific favors a wetter pattern for Alaska, but hazards thresholds are
not anticipated to be reached across the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Central and Southern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tue-Thu, Jun 1-3.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin,
interior Pacific Northwest, and the California Central Valley, Tue-Thu, Jun 1-
3.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MAY 27 - MONDAY MAY 31:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pjKxViV66KhgwmispgbLCzGXm2N4vktEGqMUp4DOehTHxLkwjQbdkD697o0rV80MZ9KVk0a3$

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 01 - MONDAY JUNE 07: The most prominent feature going into
week-2 is forecast to be enhanced mid-level ridging along the West Coast of
the
CONUS. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles all depict positive 500-hPa
height anomalies upwards of 120-meters across portions of the Northwestern
CONUS on day-8 (Jun 1), which at the surface translates to maximum temperature
anomalies of +10-20 deg F.  The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict much of
the Northern Great Basin having a 40-60% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile for Jun 1-3, with probabilities in some areas
exceeding 60%. Temperatures in some of the valleys may reach the mid-90s deg
F,
which would be close to daily records. Further south along the California
Central Valley, the probabilities for exceeding the 85th percentile are weaker
in the reforecast tools, but both tools show an increased signal for maximum
temperatures exceeding 100 deg F early in week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of
excessive heat is posted for portions of the Northern Great Basin, interior
Pacific Northwest, and the Central Valley of California for Jun 1-3, where the
tools are in good agreement, and temperatures have the highest potential to
reach hazards thresholds. Ongoing severe to extreme drought conditions across
the region are likely to exacerbate heat related impacts. The much above
normal
temperatures are likely to result in expanding drought across northeast Oregon
and Idaho. The ridging is forecast to weaken by the middle of week-2 bringing
a
moderation in temperatures.



Downstream of the ridge over the West, less amplification is favored across
the
central U.S as intermittent shortwave disturbances propagate over top the
ridge
and through the Plains resulting in decreasing 500-hPa heights. In addition,
the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict a cut-off mid-level low slowly propagating
eastward across the southwestern CONUS, which may enhance precipitation over
the central CONUS, especially if there is any interaction with northern stream
energy. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both depict at least a 20% chance
that 3-day precipitation totals for Jun 1-3 exceed the 85th percentile and 1
inch across portions of the Central and Southern Plains and the Middle and
Lower Mississippi Valley, justifying a slight risk for heavy precipitation.
Uncalibrated ECMWF guidance also shows some of these areas having at least a
40% chance for 3-day precipitation exceeding 1 inch, further supporting the
hazard. Flooding remains possible across portions of Eastern Texas and the
Lower Mississippi Valley into week-2 given high soil moistures, and the
increased time needed for river levels to drop from their current elevated
levels. Concern would also be related to increased runoff from the additional
forecast precipitation upstream during week-2, which could once again increase
river levels across these areas.



By the end of week-1, weak troughing is forecast to move into the eastern
CONUS
bringing relief from the heat expected earlier in the week. However, this is
likely a temporary reprieve as a trend toward warmer temperatures is forecast
during week-2, with the ECMWF reforecast tool in particular depicting at least
a 20% chance temperatures exceed the 85th percentile by the middle of the
period across portions of the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and Great Lakes.
However, at this time, actual temperatures are generally forecast to remain
below 90 deg F in most areas, precluding a related temperature hazard.



Troughing is forecast over the North Central Pacific, with associated surface
low pressure depicted in the vicinity of the Aleutians. As a result, enhanced
southwesterly flow is forecast across Alaska, bringing intermittent rounds of
precipitation to the southern part of the state. However, hazards thresholds
are not expected to be reached, and the increased cloud cover and
precipitation
favor near normal temperatures over much of the eastern Mainland and the
Panhandle during week-2.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 PM CDT Mon May 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

Only minor adjustments are needed based on recent trends in
guidance. Widespread elevated conditions remain most likely across
southern NV into adjacent areas of UT and AZ, and localized elevated
conditions may extend southeastward along the terrain of the
Mogollon Rim and into the Gila region of southwest NM.

...Dakotas and Minnesota...
Strong southwest winds are expected across the eastern Dakotas and
western MN, which may coincide with RH values falling into the low
30s and perhaps upper 20s. However, recent precipitation across this
region has resulted in 10 and 100 hour fuel moisture values
generally above 10%. Elevated conditions are possible where fuels
are locally receptive.

...Florida...
Very dry conditions will persist into Tuesday with RH values in the
30s expected. As with previous days, sustained winds will generally
remain near or below 10 mph, which will limit the potential for
rapid fire spread.

..Moore.. 05/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CDT Mon May 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Modest mid-level winds will overspread the western/southern Great
Basin during the afternoon on Tuesday. A surface trough will deepen
in southern Nevada into western Utah. A very dry airmass is expected
to be in place during the afternoon with 5-15% RH probable. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected with some higher gusts given very deep
boundary layer mixing. Elevated to near critical conditions may
occur in southern Nevada into adjacent southwest Utah and northwest
Arizona. Given only 20-25 mph flow in the lowest 1-3 km and a weak
surface trough, any critical conditions are expected to be
terrain-driven or brief.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
330 PM EDT Mon May 24 2021

Valid 12Z Thu May 27 2021 - 12Z Mon May 31 2021

...Overview...

A pair of shortwave troughs will track east over the northern tier
of the CONUS through Monday while the next trough digs down the
West Coast, closing off southern California Sunday as the pattern
becomes less progressive with ridging up the central Plains.
Rainfall will be focused along a cold front from the central
Plains to the East Coast on Friday, sagging south to the Gulf
Coast with the front Saturday before focusing ahead of the western
trough/low over the central Plains Sunday/Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic models continue to depict reasonable
clustering for the Thu-Sat period as low pressure along the front
moves from the Plains to the Ohio Valley to a developing cold air
damming wedge over the Mid-Atlantic. By then, uncertainty
increases with a southern stream shortwave through Texas/lower MS
Valley as well as the unfolding western trough/low and potential
stalling troughing along the East Coast. Did a typical trend
toward a majority ensemble blend (GEFS/ECENS) with a small
weighting of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian deterministic runs to offer
just a bit of detail where appropriate. Blended the 12Z/13Z
National Blend of Models with ECMWF/GFS/ECENS/GEFS for
temperatures/PoPs/QPF.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period are Thursday
night/Friday ahead of an eastward moving low from the central
Plains to the Corn Belt eastward to the central Appalachians along
a wavy frontal boundary with a potential area of organized and
moderate to heavy rain shifting across the mid/lower Mississippi
Valley into the Ohio Valley. Areas in the Mid-Atlantic look to see
light/modest showers in the developing cold air damming. Then,
return flow up the Plains meets the next cold front with potential
repeating rain over the central Plains Sunday/Monday.

Temperatures will be cool, 10 to 15 degrees below normal, in the
northern Plains to Upper Midwest to northeast Friday/Saturday,
expanding south down the Mid-Atlantic Saturday with the cold air
damming. Meanwhile hot conditions, 10 to 15 degrees above normal
and near records, persist in the Southeast until the cold frontal
passage Saturday into Sunday. For the rest of the Memorial Day
weekend, expect near to slightly below normal temperatures east of
the Rockies, while the Pacific Northwest looks to see a warming
trend with temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal by Memorial
Day.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 30 - JUN 03, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and ridging over the Pacific
coast of North America. Downstream, a trough is forecast over central Canada
extending southward into the northern central CONUS. Ridging is predicted over
the southeastern CONUS, and a shortwave trough is predicted over the Southwest
near the California-Mexico border. The manual blend of models forecasts
positive 500-hPa height anomalies across most of the CONUS, with stronger
positive height anomalies centered over the Northwest and Northeast regions.
Near normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over the Southwest, associated with
the shortwave trough there. Southerly low-level surface flow is predicted into
the eastern CONUS, around surface high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

Above normal temperatures are predicted for the eastern Aleutians and western
Mainland Alaska, associated with enhanced southerly flow ahead of the
predicted
trough. Near normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle, related to onshore flow and cloud cover. Enhanced
easterly flow and negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely below
normal
temperatures for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska. Probabilities of above
normal temperatures are enhanced for the western CONUS extending eastward
along
the Canadian border into the western Great Lakes region, as well as for
northern areas of the Northeast region, under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Weaker 500-hPa height anomalies favor near to below normal
temperatures for remaining areas of the central and eastern CONUS. Below
normal
temperatures are most favored over the Central and Southern Plains and the
Mid-Atlantic, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and North Pacific and associated onshore
flow lead to increased chances of above normal precipitation for southern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted ridge over the Pacific
coast and positive 500-hPa height anomalies lead to increased probabilities of
near to below normal precipitation for the western CONUS, the Northern Plains,
and the western Great Lakes region. Increased probabilities of above normal
precipitation are indicated from the southern High Plains across the Central
Mississippi Valley, under southerly surface flow and consistent with the
precipitation consolidation tool. Enhanced ridging increases probabilities of
below normal precipitation over parts of the Southeast, while near normal is
favored for the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, where precipitation tools are
uncertain.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and
10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 01 - 07 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify slightly relative to the 6-10 day period. Troughing over
the Aleutians shifts slightly westward relative to the 6-10 day period, while
above normal heights over the eastern North Pacific and western CONUS broaden
in extent. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the Northeast region
increase
in extent and magnitude relative to the 6-10 day period.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures continue to be favored for a
smaller
area of western Mainland Alaska and parts of the Aleutians, associated with
enhanced mid-level southerly flow ahead of a predicted trough. Near normal
temperatures are favored for the remainder of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, where temperature tools are less consistent. Above normal
temperatures are favored for the western CONUS, the Northern Plains, and the
Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures
are favored over parts of the Southern Plains, with predicted southerly
surface
flow and enhanced precipitation.

Above normal precipitation is favored for southern and central Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle, due to predicted onshore flow. Near to below normal
precipitation is likely over much of the western CONUS, under positive 500-hPa
height anomalies associated with the predicted ridge. Chances of above normal
precipitation are slightly enhanced over a large area of the central and
eastern CONUS, related to potential storm systems, under anomalous southerly
surface flow, and consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. Near
normal precipitation is favored for the Gulf Coast, as indicated by the
precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Continuing rounds of showers and thunderstorms found across the
Great Plains and Midwest before spreading into the Northeast on
Wednesday...

...Record heat forecast across the Mid-Atlantic States by
midweek...

Potentially hazardous weather will continue to be found across the
central U.S. over the next few days as ample moisture continues to
stream northward out of the western Gulf of Mexico. A potent low
pressure system located over south-central Canada will slowly
drift eastward through Tuesday before strengthening and racing
northeastward. Meanwhile, an attached stationary boundary and slow
moving cold front will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms
tonight and Tuesday from the southern/central Plains to the
Midwest. A few thunderstorms may turn severe from the southern
High Plains to Nebraska, with the highest chances for isolated
tornadoes and large hail found across western Kansas tonight.
Flash flooding is also a possibility across the central and
southern Plains where thunderstorms stall or repeat over similar
locations. Southeast Texas has received an abundance of rainfall
over the last few weeks and additional thunderstorms over this
region could lead to more flooding concerns this evening. WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall over parts of southeast
Texas tonight, with Flash Flood Watches also in effect.

A separate system currently entering the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to reach the central High Plains by Wednesday and produce
an additional round of spring thunderstorms across the central
Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a slight risk of
severe weather from eastern Wyoming to southwest Iowa and
northwest Missouri on Wednesday. Showers will likely be found
across the northern Rockies and Great Basin on Tuesday and
Wednesday as well.

Throughout the eastern U.S., the brief shot of cool weather today
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will be short lived as a
warm front lifts across the region by Wednesday. In fact,
record-breaking warmth is forecast from North Carolina to New
Jersey. High temperatures are expected to reach the low-to-mid 90s
and around 10 to 20 degrees above average. The combination of warm
temperatures and an approaching cold front may also lead to
scattered thunderstorms Wednesday evening, with a few severe
thunderstorms not out of the question.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1244 AM CDT Tue May 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move across the northern/central Great Basin
today. At the surface, a weak surface trough will develop in central
Nevada into western Utah. Elsewhere, a cold front will move across
parts of the Upper Midwest while surface high pressure will remain
entrenched in the Southeast.

...Southern Great Basing/Northwest Arizona...
A combination of increasing, but modest, mid-level winds and an
increasing surface pressure gradient will bring elevated fire
weather concerns across parts of southern Nevada, northwest Arizona,
and southwestern Utah. Winds of 15-20 mph will overlap with 5-15% RH
during the afternoon. While locally critical conditions are
possible, these will likely be terrain-driven given the weak surface
trough and the stronger mid-level winds displaced to the north and
west.

...West-central/southwest Minnesota...
Dry and windy conditions are expected behind a weak cold front.
Boundary-layer mixing could produce wind gusts near 30 mph. Portions
of west-central and southwest Minnesota have received limited
rainfall over the past week. Some locally elevated concern for fire
spread in dry grasses could develop given the potential for 20-25%
RH during the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CDT Tue May 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough will approach the Southwest. While
mid-level winds will increase over a very dry (5-15% RH) airmass,
the jet core will arrive very late, beyond peak heating. A rather
weak lee trough will again enhance surface winds in parts of the
central/southern High Plains. Fuels region-wide are not particularly
receptive to fire spread currently. Only locally elevated fire
weather concerns are expected on Wednesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
245 AM EDT Tue May 25 2021

Valid 12Z Fri May 28 2021 - 12Z Tue Jun 01 2021

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest next week...

...Overview...

Upper ridging is forecast to build into the Pacific Northwest
early next week as a front in the East sinks southward. The
western end of the front will linger over the Plains, helping to
promote a few chances of showers and storms which may contain some
locally heavy rainfall. After a recent spell of warm weather in
the East and cool temperatures in the West/Northwest, the opposite
will manifest itself through the weekend into next week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models showed
reasonable clustering for the Fri-Sun period as low pressure in
the Ohio Valley moves off the Carolina/southern Mid-Atlantic
coast. Trend in the guidance has been for a stronger wave aloft
and a farther push southward of the surface cold front (into the
northern Gulf of Mexico) late Sat/early Sun. With increased
sharpness overall, offshore frontal boundary has the potential to
form one or more surface waves as the boundary slowly lifts
northeastward. How close this may be to the coast will influence
the amount of clouds/rain. Over the West, ensembles show good
agreement on building upper ridging (to at least +2 sigma) into
the Pacific Northwest, downstream of equally-as-deep troughing
south of Alaska.

Blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET served well for
Fri-Sat, before the UKMET appeared too weak in the East and was
discounted. Thereafter, dropped the Canadian from the preference
as it was much more progressive off New England with low pressure,
but much slower over California with a potential upper low next
week. The 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF were then used in conjunction with
their ensemble means for the Mon-Tue period as either was
plausible in light of the ensemble spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period will be near the
exiting low pressure in the East Friday, then back over the
central/southern Plains to the Corn Belt along the west end of the
wavy frontal boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold
front. The West Coast will see little to no precipitation but
areas near and east of the Great Basin to the Divide may see at
least scattered showers as the upper trough moves in and a weak
cold front sinks through.

Temperatures will be cool (about 10 to 15 degrees below normal) in
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast Friday/Saturday, expanding
south down the Mid-Atlantic Saturday with a cold air damming
setup. Warm temperatures in the Southeast will cool as the cold
front works down to the Gulf. The Pacific Northwest will see a
warming trend with temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above normal by
Memorial Day into next Tuesday. This could approach/exceed record
levels for parts of Oregon/northern California and could continue
into the week beyond this period. See the latest CPC day 6-10
forecast and 8-14 day U.S. Hazards Outlook for more information.

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest next week...

...Overview...

Upper ridging is forecast to build into the Pacific Northwest
early next week as a front in the East sinks southward. The
western end of the front will linger over the Plains, helping to
promote a few chances of showers and storms which may contain some
locally heavy rainfall. After a recent spell of warm weather in
the East and cool temperatures in the West/Northwest, the opposite
will manifest itself through the weekend into next week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models showed
reasonable clustering for the Fri-Sun period as low pressure in
the Ohio Valley moves off the Carolina/southern Mid-Atlantic
coast. Trend in the guidance has been for a stronger wave aloft
and a farther push southward of the surface cold front (into the
northern Gulf of Mexico) late Sat/early Sun. With increased
sharpness overall, offshore frontal boundary has the potential to
form one or more surface waves as the boundary slowly lifts
northeastward. How close this may be to the coast will influence
the amount of clouds/rain. Over the West, ensembles show good
agreement on building upper ridging (to at least +2 sigma) into
the Pacific Northwest, downstream of equally-as-deep troughing
south of Alaska.

Blend of the 18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET served well for
Fri-Sat, before the UKMET appeared too weak in the East and was
discounted. Thereafter, dropped the Canadian from the preference
as it was much more progressive off New England with low pressure,
but much slower over California with a potential upper low next
week. The 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF were then used in conjunction with
their ensemble means for the Mon-Tue period as either was
plausible in light of the ensemble spread.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period will be near the
exiting low pressure in the East Friday, then back over the
central/southern Plains to the Corn Belt along the west end of the
wavy frontal boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold
front. The West Coast will see little to no precipitation but
areas near and east of the Great Basin to the Divide may see at
least scattered showers as the upper trough moves in and a weak
cold front sinks through.

Temperatures will be cool (about 10 to 15 degrees below normal) in
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast Friday/Saturday, expanding
south down the Mid-Atlantic Saturday with a cold air damming
setup. Warm temperatures in the Southeast will cool as the cold
front works down to the Gulf. The Pacific Northwest will see a
warming trend with temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above normal by
Memorial Day into next Tuesday. This could approach/exceed record
levels for parts of Oregon/northern California and could continue
into the week beyond this period. See the latest CPC day 6-10
forecast and 8-14 day U.S. Hazards Outlook for more information.

...Showers and thunderstorms across the Great Plains and Midwest
will spread into the Northeast on Wednesday...

...More wet snow for the northern Rockies to North Dakota as
strong to severe thunderstorms develop in the north-central
Plains...

...Heat intensifies along the East Coast on Wednesday...

A large and rather intense low pressure system over south-central
Canada will begin to move more quickly toward the northeast and
intensify further.  This will help pushing the trailing cold front
to move more quickly across the Plains toward the eastern U.S.
during the next couple of days.  The associated scattered showers
and thunderstorms will continue to be across the central to
southern Plains into tonight.  By Wednesday, a reinforcing cold
front moving across the Great Lakes will push the showers and
thunderstorms steadily eastward toward the northeastern U.S. as
heat is forecast to intensify up and down the East Coast Wednesday
afternoon.  The Mid-Atlantic states could see readings challenging
daily high temperature records after another day of relatively
cool and damp conditions.  Parts of the upper Midwest could see
thunderstorm reaching severe levels this evening.  The Northeast
will see a higher chance for severe weather later on Wednesday
ahead of a strong cold front.

In contrast to the heat in the East, cooler than normal conditions
will continue across the Northwest.  A frontal system currently
entering the Pacific Northwest is forecast to reach the central
High Plains by Wednesday and produce the next round of spring
thunderstorms across the central Plains. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a enhanced risk of severe weather from eastern
Wyoming to southwest Iowa and northwest Missouri on Wednesday.
Showers will likely be found across the northern Rockies and Great
Basin on Tuesday and Wednesday as well.

Throughout the eastern U.S., the brief shot of cool weather today
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will be short lived as a
warm front lifts across the region by Wednesday. In fact,
record-breaking warmth is forecast from North Carolina to New
Jersey. High temperatures are expected to reach the low-to-mid 90s
and around 10 to 20 degrees above average. The combination of warm
temperatures and an approaching cold front may also lead to
scattered thunderstorms Wednesday evening, with a few severe
thunderstorms not out of the question.

chances down across the Mid-Atlantic.

In contrast to the heat in the East, cooler than normal conditions
will continue across the Northwest.  A frontal system currently
entering the Pacific Northwest is forecast to bring another round
of wet snow for the higher elevation of the northern Rockies on
Wednesday.  This system will then exit the Rockies later on
Wednesday and trigger the next round of spring thunderstorms
across the northern and central Plains. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued an enhanced risk of severe weather across the
north-central Plains Wednesday into early Thursday.  By Thursday
morning, the thunderstorms should be pushing east toward the
Midwest while some wet snow could be falling in North Dakota on
the northern periphery of a low pressure system developing in the
central Plains.

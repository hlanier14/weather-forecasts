Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1001 AM CST Sat Nov 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Sat Nov 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Long wave troughing with several embedded shortwave features will
continue across the eastern half of the US today as a strong
mid-level jet and shortwave trough traverse the central Rockies. At
the surface, high pressure will strengthen through the Great Basin
while a lee trough develops across the High Plains. Cooler and drier
conditions across the CONUS will limit fire weather potential,
through locally elevated conditions may linger in spots through the
day.

...Eastern New Mexico and portions of the Southern High Plains...
With lee troughing expected to develop through the day across the
High Plains, gusty west/southwest winds will likely increase through
the afternoon across portions of eastern New Mexico and west Texas.
Winds of 15-20 mph will be possible with occasional higher gusts in
and around the higher terrain. Despite cooler surface conditions to
start the day, model soundings also show relatively dry low-levels
with RH less than 25% possible through peak heating. Some overlap of
dry and windy conditions is expected, though fuels remain somewhat
limited across the region. This suggests that any fire weather
threat should remain local in nature.

...Southern California...
Moderate offshore flow will linger through the day Saturday as drier
air begins to move in from the interior deserts. Despite
increasingly warm temperatures and low humidity, upper level support
remains relatively weak suggesting low-level winds will remain
mostly unfavorable for widespread fire weather conditions across
much of southern California. Some increase in winds early in the
period and late overnight suggests low-end elevated fire weather
potential will be possible across the coastal ranges where fuels are
supportive. However, fire weather concerns remain low.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1101 AM EST Sat Nov 13 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 16 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 20 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
A progressive flow regime, with troughing amplifying mid-continent
Wednesday and next Saturday, will be seen this period.  While
detail issues remain, the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF/00z UKMET fit best
with the ensemble means, with the 00z Canadian falling out of
favor as early as Wednesday with its more progressive flow
pattern.  With some amplification expected at times, quicker does
not seem best.  The pressures, precipitation forecast, winds, and
500 hPa heights were primarily derived from the 06z GFS, 00z
UKMET, 00z ECMWF, and the 00z NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means.  The
remainder of the grids relied heavily on the 13z National Blend of
Models guidance.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
Expect mostly light to moderate rain and higher elevation snow
over the northern Rockies early Tuesday in association with the
upper trough/leading cold front pushing through the region before
fading. The potent surface low tracking across southern Canada
Tuesday onward will bring a period of strong/gusty winds to
northern tier areas, especially the Northern Plains on Tuesday
into Wednesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the low's
trailing cold front from midweek onward, leading to mostly
light/moderate rain over portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys along with some light precipitation in the Great
Lakes region. The southern Florida Peninsula should increasing
rainfall mid-late week as moisture interacts with a stalled front
to the south.  Some precipitation should reach the West late week,
but for the moment only modest amounts are expected.  The Midwest
should see moderate precipitation late Friday-Saturday as the
western system sweeps eastward.

Well above normal temperatures will continue into Tuesday over the
Plains and southern half of the West. The warmest readings versus
normal should be over the Plains where plus 15-25F anomalies will
be common and some daily records for highs/warm lows will be
possible. Currently the best potential for highs to approach/reach
record values is over the western half of Texas. As the cold front
emerging from the Northeast continues onward, warmth will extend
into the South and East Wednesday-Thursday but in modified form
with highs/lows generally only up to 10-15F above normal. Cooler
air behind the front will spread mostly 5-10F below normal
temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. from Wednesday
through the rest of the week.

A progressive flow regime, with troughing amplifying mid-continent
Wednesday and next Saturday, will be seen this period.  While
detail issues remain, the 06z GFS/00z ECMWF/00z UKMET fit best
with the ensemble means, with the 00z Canadian falling out of
favor as early as Wednesday with its more progressive flow
pattern.  With some amplification expected at times, quicker does
not seem best.  The pressures, precipitation forecast, winds, and
500 hPa heights were primarily derived from the 06z GFS, 00z
UKMET, 00z ECMWF, and the 00z NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means.  The
remainder of the grids relied heavily on the 13z National Blend of
Models guidance.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
Expect mostly light to moderate rain and higher elevation snow
over the northern Rockies early Tuesday in association with the
upper trough/leading cold front pushing through the region before
fading. The potent surface low tracking across southern Canada
Tuesday onward will bring a period of strong/gusty winds to
northern tier areas, especially the Northern Plains on Tuesday
into Wednesday. Moisture should increase ahead of the low's
trailing cold front from midweek onward, leading to mostly
light/moderate rain over portions of the Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys along with some light precipitation in the Great
Lakes region. The southern Florida Peninsula should increasing
rainfall mid-late week as moisture interacts with a stalled front
to the south.  Some precipitation should reach the West late week,
but for the moment only modest amounts are expected.  The Midwest
should see moderate precipitation late Friday-Saturday as the
western system sweeps eastward.

Well above normal temperatures will continue into Tuesday over the
Plains and southern half of the West. The warmest readings versus
normal should be over the Plains where plus 15-25F anomalies will
be common and some daily records for highs/warm lows will be
possible. Currently the best potential for highs to approach/reach
record values is over the western half of Texas. As the cold front
emerging from the Northeast continues onward, warmth will extend
into the South and East Wednesday-Thursday but in modified form
with highs/lows generally only up to 10-15F above normal. Cooler
air behind the front will spread mostly 5-10F below normal
temperatures across the central and eastern U.S. from Wednesday
through the rest of the week.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Sat Nov 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime will continue Day2/Sunday as the
shortwave trough over the Rockies ejects eastward and deepens across
the central and eastern US. To the west, ridging will steadily
build, shunting stronger mid-level flow to the north and east. High
pressure over the Great Basin will intensify, supporting warmer and
drier conditions through much of the West. Occasional dry and breezy
conditions will likely linger over portions of the High plains,
though coverage should remain low. With high pressure in place
little overlap between strong winds and warm/dry conditions is
expected across the lower 48 Sunday. As such, no fire weather areas
will be included at this time.

...Departing low pressure systems will produce unsettled weather
over New England tonight before ending on Sunday...

...Next round of heavy rain and mountain snow arrives over the
Pacific Northwest tonight....

...An Alberta clipper will deliver another around of snow and
gusty winds across the northern tier states through the weekend...

Tonight, a low pressure center is forecast to form and intensify
rather quickly over New England while the cold front exits the
East Coast.  Some thunderstorms could form and become strong later
today over southern New England as the low pressure center
develops.  In addition, a burst of precipitation is forecast for
interior New England tonight following the passage of the low
center. Higher elevations could see a burst of wet snow together
with gusty winds on the backside of this system. A Slight Risk of
Severe Thunderstorms was issued for southern New England tonight.
Damaging wind gusts will be the main threat with these
thunderstorms, while hail and isolated tornadoes are possible as
well.

The quick round of rain/wet snow is forecast to depart New England
on Sunday as the compact storm exits into the Canadian Maritimes.
Colder air will then be ushered in across the Great Lakes, leading
to the likelihood of lake-effect snow or mixed precipitation in
the lee of the Great Lakes on Sunday.  Meanwhile, an Alberta
clipper is forecast to track across the Great Lakes on Sunday.
This quick-moving storm will deliver another round of snow and
gusty winds through these areas, with rain showers farther to the
south.  By Monday morning, the Alberta clipper should be tracking
near the Canadian border of New England while another low pressure
system is forecast to form near the New England coast. The new
system will later take over as the more dominant system.

Over the Pacific Northwest, the next round of heavy rain is
scheduled to arrive on Sunday ahead of an active warm front coming
from the Pacific.  While it appears that this next round of heavy
precipitation will be confined to the northwestern portion of
Washington state, the surge of moisture will be unrelenting into
Monday morning. There's a Slight Risk of Heavy Rain leading to
Flash Flooding for parts of northwestern Washington state, as a
result. The higher elevations of the northern Cascades will likely
see heavy snow measured in feet during the next few days. This
system will then move into the Northern Rockies Monday night as it
spreads rain and high elevation snow into the region.

The entire western U.S. will remain milder than normal through the
weekend.  Much milder than normal conditions are expected over the
northern High Plains on Monday with developing downslope flow as
another Alberta clipper is forecast to form.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat November 13 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

system will then move into the Northern Rockies Monday night as it
spreads rain and high elevation snow into the region.

The entire western U.S. will remain milder than normal through the
weekend.  Much milder than normal conditions are expected over the
northern High Plains on Monday with developing downslope flow as
another Alberta clipper is forecast to form.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to show a progressive pattern with
broad cyclonic flow across most of the lower 48 while an upstream
ridge builds over the eastern Pacific next weekend.  This regime
will favor some day-to-day variability in weather conditions and a
trend toward moderate temperatures, generally within 10F on either
side of normal.  Guidance remains fairly well clustered for a
strong southern into eastern Canada storm system and trailing cold
front sweeping through the eastern half of the country mid-late
week.  Predictability remains lower than desired for details
behind this system but some common ideas are starting to take
shape and hopefully solutions make additional progress in
converging soon.

Specifics over the eastern Pacific Wednesday-Thursday and
continuing eastward across the lower 48 thereafter have been
particularly troublesome in recent days.  Over the past 24 hours
the models have been converging toward varying degrees of
interaction among amplifying energy originating from the Bering
Sea/Aleutians/North Pacific and a weakening shortwave to the south
to produce a surface system that reaches somewhere along the
northern half of the West Coast by late Thursday or so.  This is
better than previous days when an isolated model run had a system
reaching the coast while the rest weakened it well offshore.
However there is still a wide range of possibilities for strength
and track...00Z GFS strongest/northward and 00Z UKMET weakest
(flat with its shortwave), while northward trends in the 18Z/00Z
GFS and 00Z CMC/00Z ECMWF leave the 12Z ECMWF on the southern side
of the envelope now.  Not surprisingly ensemble members also show
a lot of latitude spread.  The 00Z model trends may suggest a
northward adjustment may be in store after the current forecast
made use of the 12Z GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET from Wednesday into early
Friday.

The relative improvement in clustering for a meaningful eastern
Pacific into western U.S. shortwave after midweek has brought
guidance closer together for the lower 48 pattern by mid-late
period.  In particular the GFS is now holding its shortwave energy
far enough west to join the ensemble means and most other models
that have been showing high pressure over the eastern U.S. and
western Atlantic versus a low pressure system that some earlier
GFS runs had depicted.  The most common theme in the guidance at
the moment is for a frontal system to reach the Plains by Saturday
and continue eastward into Sunday.  The ridge that builds off the
West Coast during the weekend may support elongation of upper
troughing into the Southwest U.S., which would lead to some
deceleration of the front over the southern Plains.  The 00Z ECMWF
has shifted noticeably farther west with the upper ridge versus
continuity.  The forecast during the latter half of the period
trended to a 40-50 percent total weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF
means with the rest composed of the ECMWF/CMC and 12-18Z GFS runs
(whose input diminished late due to increasing differences
relative to consensus).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The vigorous surface low tracking across southern into eastern
Canada mid-late week will bring a period of strong winds to
northern tier areas, especially the Northern Plains into Wednesday
and perhaps to some degree locations farther east thereafter.
Expect mostly light to moderate rain to develop along the trailing
cold front over the east-central U.S. around Wednesday and
progress eastward/northeastward into Thursday.  Highest totals
should extend northeastward from the south-central Mississippi
Valley.  Chilly flow behind the system may produce a period of
lake effect precipitation, mainly over the upper and eastern
portions of the Great Lakes.  The southern Florida Peninsula will
likely see increasing rainfall mid-late week as moisture interacts
with a stalled front to the south.  Easterly low level flow should
lead to highest totals over eastern areas.  Meanwhile it looks
increasingly likely that a Pacific system reaching the northern
half of the West Coast after midweek will produce organized
precipitation over central/northern parts of the West.
Uncertainty over the strength and track of the system maintain
lower than desired confidence in details of precipitation coverage
and magnitude as well as any wind effects near the coast.  The
energy from this system may support a central U.S. front that
could start to produce some rain by next weekend.  Northern parts
of the Pacific Northwest may see another episode of precipitation
next weekend.

Overall expect temperatures across the lower 48 to reach fairly
seasonable levels by next weekend with many locations seeing highs
within a few degrees of normal.  Before then, the warm sector
ahead of the front crossing the eastern half of the country
Wednesday-Thursday will bring a brief period of warmth to the
South and East as temperatures reach up to 10-15F above normal
(perhaps even warmer for morning lows on Wednesday).  Colder air
behind the front will spread from the Plains into the East
mid-late week with readings generally 5-10F or so below normal.
Parts of the High Plains could rebound to scattered plus 10F
anomalies on Friday.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough will continue to intensify as it moves out
of the Plains early this morning and into the eastern US. Strong
mid-level flow will accompany the trough and extend westward toward
a building ridge centered over the southern Great Basin. The strong
flow will move north along the periphery of the ridge as several
small shortwaves embedded within move ashore across the Pacific
Northwest. Surface high pressure over the Rockies and Great Basin
will support some gusty downslope flow across the Front Range and
adjacent High Plains as well as weak offshore flow across southern
California. However, with poor RH expected, significant overlap
between strong winds and warm/dry surface conditions is unlikely
through the forecast period. Fire weather concerns will remain
minimal.

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over much of the western US should flatten
somewhat under the influence of a shortwave trough moving ashore
across the Pacific Northwest early Day2/Monday. As the shortwave
strengthens, a 60 to 70 kt mid-level jet will move eastward across
the northern and central Rockies. Aided by the increasing flow aloft
across the Rockies, a potent lee trough will develop through the day
supporting strong downslope winds across the Front Range and High
Plains. Breezy conditions may extend as far south as eastern New
Mexico where somewhat warmer and drier conditions may support
locally elevated fire weather potential through the afternoon.
However, cooler temperatures and weaker winds across the rest of the
lower 48 should limit the potential for significant fire weather
concerns through the forecast period.

...Heavy rain and mountain snow resumes over the Pacific
Northwest....

...An Alberta clipper will deliver rain/snow and gusty winds
across the Great Lakes today and then New England on Monday...

...Another Alberta clipper will bring light rain/snow for the
northern Plains to upper Midwest into Monday morning...

...A much stronger storm will spread mountain snows and high winds
across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains Monday night
to Tuesday...

A compact low pressure center that brought a quick dose of rain,
high elevation snow, and gusty winds through New England last
night is quickly moving off into the Canadian Maritimes early this
morning.  Clearing skies will quickly move into the Northeast
today as mixed rain and snow from an Alberta clipper moving across
the upper Midwest this morning spreads into the Great Lakes.
While the precipitation associated with this system will mainly be
light, the coverage of mixed rain and snow will be widespread as
it tracks across the Great Lakes today and then across New England
on Monday.  The western slopes of the central Appalachians will
likely see a few inches of snow while the lee side of the lower
Great Lakes should see locally higher amounts on Monday when the
system moves across New England and drags colder air across the
warm lake waters.  By Tuesday morning, the system should have
moved far away into the Canadian Maritimes that the lake-effect
rain/snow will be tapering off.

Over the Pacific Northwest, the wave of heavy rain has arrived
well ahead of an active warm front.  While it appears that this
round of heavy precipitation will be confined to the northwestern
portion of Washington state, the unrelenting surge of moisture
will lead to a slight risk of flash flooding today especially for
the higher elevations of northwestern Washington state.  A much
stronger low pressure system will then form.  The higher
elevations of the northern Cascades will likely see heavy snow
measured in feet during the next few days.  This system will then
move into the Northern Rockies Monday night as it spreads rain and
high elevation snow into the region.

The entire western U.S. will remain milder than normal through the
weekend.  Much milder than normal conditions are expected over the
northern High Plains on Monday with developing downslope flow as
another Alberta clipper is forecast to form.

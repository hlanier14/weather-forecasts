Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Given weak large-scale forcing across the western CONUS, only
localized fire weather concerns exist. Specifically, locally
Elevated surface winds/RH may be observed this afternoon across the
Snake River Plain in southern Idaho, the Great Divide Basin in
southern Wyoming, and terrain-favoring areas of the Lower Colorado
River Basin. Otherwise, a couple of dry strikes may accompany
high-based storms across central Colorado into central New Mexico
before moving into a moister ambient environment. The sparse nature
of the dry strikes and marginal receptiveness of fuels to fire
spread preclude isolated dry thunderstorm highlights.

..Squitieri.. 09/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
Relatively benign fire weather conditions are expected today as
winds are forecast to be light across most of the West with moist
conditions expected across the East. Some locally elevated
conditions may occur in portions of the central Rockies and the
Southwest, but conditions aren't expected to be widespread or strong
enough to warrant an elevated delineation.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 14 2021

SYNOPSIS: Today's 0Z ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean mid-level pattern is more
transient compared to yesterday, resulting in less agreement regarding the
daily height pattern evolution. A series of mid-level low pressure areas are
predicted to traverse the contiguous U.S. during the period, with the longwave
pattern deamplifying fairly early in the period. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean
is an outlier and maintains a more amplified, stable pattern of mid-level high
(low) pressure across the eastern (western) lower 48 throughout the period.
Mid-level low pressure increases chances for much below normal temperatures
across parts of the Great Basin and Rockies at the beginning of the period.
Surface high pressure across parts of mainland Alaska supports much below
normal temperatures at the start of the period, which would be the first
notable cold snap of the season for many areas of the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Basin and
Northern and Central Rockies, Wed-Fri, Sep 22-24.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for interior parts of mainland
Alaska, Wed, Sep 22.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of mainland Alaska,
Wed-Thu, Sep 22-23.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 17 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 21:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qDNy2vxC95KqT_RsYkP49OtPdk__fEM_BA0PRnMnvfeekV69ytBVEFpTUL0G2Qj4iQvOrjUc$

FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 22 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 28: The 0Z ECMWF and GEFS
ensemble mean mid-level pattern is more progressive compared to yesterday,
resulting in more disagreement regarding the daily evolution of the pattern
and
resultant timing of potential hazards. Both models indicate a series of
shortwave troughs propagating eastward across the CONUS during week-2, with
the
overall longwave pattern deamplifying early in week-2. The 0z Canadian is an
outlier, and maintains a relatively stable pattern of ridging (troughing)
across the eastern (western) CONUS throughout the period. Despite these model
differences, mid-level troughing across the western CONUS is anticipated at
the
beginning of the period, supporting increased chances for much below normal
temperatures. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble favors a more amplified mid-level trough
at
the beginning of week-2 persisting longer compared to the 0Z GEFS which
weakens
the trough by day 9 (Sep 23). These differences are reflected in the
reforecast
tools, where the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates a much stronger signal for
much below temperatures, both in spatial coverage and duration, compared to
the
GEFS reforecast tool. A broad area of slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted for parts of the Great Basin and Northern and
Central Rockies, where there is the most agreement between the reforecast
tools
indicating 20% or greater probabilities for minimum temperatures falling below
the lowest 15th percentile and freezing.



The aforementioned series of mid-level troughs could support surface low
formation across the central CONUS and associated frontal activity. No related
heavy precipitation hazards are posted at this time due to the reforecast
tools
not being supportive of a related risk and the expectation that these features
are fairly progressive. As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is
monitoring a surface disturbance with a 60% chance of forming into a tropical
cyclone during week-1 near the Bahamas in the next five days. Any potential
impacts from this disturbance would occur prior to week-2. The NHC also
indicates a 90% chance of a tropical wave over the eastern tropical Atlantic
forming into a tropical cyclone, in the next five days, although it is too far
out in lead time to determine whether there will be any related hazardous
impacts to the CONUS. Therefore, no hazards related to tropical disturbances
are posted at this time.



Across Alaska, surface high pressure is anticipated to build across parts of
mainland Alaska at the beginning of the period which could allow cold arctic
air to spill southward into the state. Both reforecast tools are in good
agreement regarding this anomalous cold signal, showing at least a 20% chance
of many parts of mainland Alaska falling to the lowest 15th percentile and
sub-freezing temperatures at the beginning of week-2. The areas of much below
normal temperature risk have been expanded compared to yesterday, given the
increased signal in multiple tools and good run to run model consistency. The
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is highlighted across many parts
of the Mainland, Sep 22 to 23, with an embedded area of moderate risk for Sep
22, where reforecast tools have the highest probabilities indicating
temperatures reaching the aforementioned hazardous thresholds. The ECMWF
(GEFS)
reforecast tool indicates greater spatial coverage of at least a 60% (40%)
chance of minimum temperatures reaching the aforementioned temperature
thresholds. The daily 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means indicate the potential
for minimum temperature anomalies reaching at least 10 Deg F lower than normal
in some of the highlighted risk areas, especially across the higher elevation
areas. This would be the first notable cold snap for parts of mainland Alaska,
with temperatures reaching sub-freezing for the first time of the season.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The synoptic pattern will be amplifying during the extended period
with troughing over the West and ridging over the East. As the
week progress so will the trough, shifting from the western states
into the central U.S. The flow in between will help move along
frontal systems across the Plains and New England. There is an
area of convection near the Bahamas in the short term that the
models have organizing by or before the day 3 period and persists
through day 7 as it tracks further out over the Atlantic Ocean.
The National Hurricane Center is monitoring this disturbance as a
possible tropical system so refer to NHC's Tropical Weather
Outlooks for additional information. The intensity and placement
of QPF will be dependent on the strength and path of this feature,
however at this time the heaviest rainfall should remain offshore,
perhaps well offshore.

The clustering of the models is relatively good initially, but
they continue to struggle with the overall evolution of a few key
features that by day 5- particularly the timing of the trough axis
and individual shortwave perturbations within the mean trough
begin to arise as it enters the Western U.S. The ensemble means
have a better handle on this especially for days 6 and 7 therefore
were utilized heavily. WPC favored an increasing blend towards the
ensemble means days 5-7 with some modest contributions from the
ECMWF and GFS for added flow definition. This blend of guidance
maintained continuity with the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Tropical cyclone Nicholas will likely be recent memory by this
start of this forecast but remnant tropical moisture may stick
around over the Gulf states but with low confidence in the
details. Back along the gulf coast, this moisture may also
interact with a potential convergence boundary to produce
additional mainly light to moderate rainfall across parts of
southeast Texas and Louisiana. Localized instances of flooding may
be possible, depending on resulting heavy rain impacts as Nicholas
moves through that region during the short range.

Fronts tracking through the northern tier of the country will
bring areas of rain, possibly moderate to heavy across portions of
the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes. With greater
confidence, areas of moderate to locally heavy rainfall will
likely reach the Pacific Northwest Friday into the weekend with
some snow possible in the highest elevations of the Washington
Cascades and into the Northern Rockies. The majority of rainfall
with the possible system off the East Coast should remain offshore
but areas from the Mid-Atlantic into New England should continue
to monitor forecasts closely due to the western periphery of the
moisture shield being very sensitive to exact track.

The amplified troughing  over the West will allow for cooler
temperatures over the Northwest. Daily highs will average 10-15F
below normal beyond Friday with gradual expansion into the
Northern Rockies as surface high pressure settles in behind the
front. A warming trend in temperatures is expected from the
Southern/Central Plains to the Northeast within a building ridge
aloft. Warmest anomalies of possibly +10-20F should shift from the
Northern Plains on Saturday into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
Sunday-Monday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue September 14 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 20 - 24 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions show good agreement among the models on the
500-hPa flow pattern over North America. An amplified 500-hPa trough is
forecast over the southern Bering Sea and another trough stretches from
northern Alaska to the northwest CONUS. A mean ridge is favored over much of
the remainder of the CONUS. The 500-hPa height blend features positive height
anomalies over much of the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska with
negative height anomalies over the remainder of Mainland Alaska, the Alaska
Panhandle, and the northwestern CONUS. Positive height anomalies are favored
over much of the remainder of the CONUS, underneath mean ridging.

Amplified troughing and surface flow favor below-normal temperatures for much
of Alaska and the western CONUS. Predicted 500-hPa ridging forecast over the
southwestern CONUS and most of the eastern CONUS leads to enhanced chances of
above-normal temperatures, with the highest probability (exceeding 80%) over
the eastern Midwest and much of the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast.

Along and west of the forecast mean trough axis, easterly surface flow is
predicted, increasing odds of below-normal precipitation over parts of western
Mainland Alaska. The forecast trough over Alaska favors an active storm track
and increased onshore flow across parts of the remainder of Mainland Alaska,
the Alaska Panhandle, and portions of the northwestern CONUS, leading to
enhanced odds of above normal precipitation. Southeast of the predicted trough
over the Gulf of Alaska, forecast surface high pressure increases the
likelihood of near to below-normal precipitation across most of the western
and
central CONUS. Ahead of the predicted trough over the northwestern CONUS,
several storm systems with trailing frontal boundaries are forecast to sweep
eastward, favoring above-normal precipitation for much of the eastern half of
the U.S. However, below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the
Northeast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the ensemble models and tools in depicting a relatively
amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertainty in the position and
strength of the forecast trough.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 22 - 28 2021

Heading into the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern shows a slight progression
of the 6-10 day mean 500-hPa pattern, though the amplitude of most features is
expected to be lower due to increased uncertainty related to larger ensemble
spread. Due to the pattern being very similar to the 6-10 day period, the
Week-2 temperature and precipitation probability forecasts are very similar as
well. The potential for tropical activity and moisture surges from south or
east during the Week-2 period slightly increases the likelihood of above-
normal
precipitation in the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast. The GEFS reforecast
tool continues to offer a drier model solution than the ECMWF reforecast tool
along the Gulf Coast and across the Southeast. The week-2 precipitation
outlook
across these areas may be modified in subsequent forecasts if the GEFS
reforecast tool maintains its solution and predicted surface pressure becomes
more prevalent.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the models and tools, and a persistent pattern across the
domain with good day-to-day consistency, off set by increased uncertainty
among
the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0252 PM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

The two Elevated areas were joined in proximity to the Sawtooth
Range/Bitterroot Mountains, as the latest guidance consensus shows
15+ mph sustained southwesterly winds overlapping 15-20% RH by
afternoon. Otherwise, latest guidance consensus continues to show
widespread Elevated/locally Critical surface conditions across
portions of the central and northern Rockies into the northern High
Plains (see the previous forecast below for more details). Lastly, a
few dry strikes may accompany high-based storms in parts of central
New Mexico tomorrow, though the general lack of fuel receptiveness
to fire spread suggests that dry thunderstorm highlights are not
currently needed.

..Squitieri.. 09/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CDT Tue Sep 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a strong area of low pressure is forecast to cross the
Canadian Prairies as moderate to strong mid-level flow traverses the
Canadian Rockies. A cold front will extend from this surface low
along the northern Plains and into the central High Plains.

...Eastern Idaho into Southern Wyoming...
Deep mixing is forecast across much of the Great Basin and central
Rockies Wednesday afternoon. Mid-level flow is expected to
strengthen throughout the day with the stronger flow expanding
southward into the northern Great Basin. Some of this stronger flow
is expected to transfer to the surface in the well-mixed airmass
across the region. Winds of 15 to 20 mph are forecast with relative
humidity dropping into the single digits in some locations.

...Eastern Montana into western North Dakota and far northwest South
Dakota...
Breezy conditions are expected to develop as the pressure gradient
tightens across the northern Plains through the day. Dry westerly
flow behind the cold front is forecast to bring relative humidity of
20 to 30 percent. Farther north, across northeast Montana, winds may
exceed 25 mph, but relative humidity is expected to remain at or
above 30 percent. However, fuels are dry in the area the strong
winds may overcompensate for the higher relative humidity.
Therefore, it seems justifiable to include the elevated delineation
into this area.

Topical Storm NICHOLAS is forecast to weaken to a Tropical
Depression slowly where the main hazard is heavy rainfall.
NICHOLAS will slowly move eastward to Louisiana and lose its
tropical characteristics by Thursday evening.  The system will
produce heavy rain over parts of the Central Gulf Coast through
Thursday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a High Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast associated with the heavy
rain through Wednesday morning.  Severe, widespread flash flooding
is expected with NICHOLAS. Areas that normally do not experience
flash flooding will flood. Lives and property are in great danger
through Wednesday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat will
weaken slightly to a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Central Gulf Coast on Wednesday into Thursday
morning. Similarly, the excessive rainfall threat will continue to
lessen on Thursday, with a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over
the region.  However, the excessive rainfall threat may linger as
with other systems that have slowly spun down over the Gulf Coast
region.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Great Lakes roughly westward
to the Central High Plains will slowly move eastward, moving off
the Northeast Coast by Thursday evening, while parts of the
boundary dissipate. Moisture pooling along the front will aid in
producing showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of the
boundary, and some of the storms will become severe.  Therefore,
the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic through Sunday morning.
The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.

In addition, along the western end of the front, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Central High Plains through Wednesday morning.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and minimal tornado threat. As the
boundary moves eastward, the threat for severe thunderstorms will
move eastward over the Northeast into parts of the Central
Appalachians/northern Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday as the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms there for Wednesday
into Thursday. Showers and thunderstorms will continue over parts
of the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast through Thursday evening.

Furthermore, a front moving onshore over the Pacific Northwest
will move eastward to the Upper Midwest by Thursday, producing
showers and thunderstorms.  However, there will be a threat of
fire weather over parts of the Northern High Plains until the
front passes through Wednesday morning as Red Flag Warnings are
issued over the area due to high temperatures, low moisture
content, and gusty winds.  Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees
above average over parts of the Northern High Plains.

Topical Storm NICHOLAS is forecast to weaken to a Tropical
Depression slowly where the main hazard is heavy rainfall.
NICHOLAS will slowly move eastward to Louisiana and lose its
tropical characteristics by Thursday evening.  The system will
produce heavy rain over parts of the Central Gulf Coast through
Thursday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a High Risk of excessive
rainfall for a small portion of the Central Gulf Coast, with a
Moderate Risk covering much of southern Louisiana through
Wednesday morning.  This indicates that numerous to widespread
flash flooding is expected across the region, including some areas
that do not normally experience flash flooding.  The excessive
rainfall threat will weaken slightly to a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Central Gulf Coast on
Wednesday into Thursday morning. Similarly, the excessive rainfall
threat will continue to lessen on Thursday, with a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over the region.  However, the excessive
rainfall threat may linger as with other systems that have slowly
spun down over the Gulf Coast region.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The synoptic pattern during the medium range period will be
amplifying as ridging builds over the east and a trough digs into
the West this weekend and shifts eastward into the central U.S. by
early to middle of next week. By Tuesday or Wednesday of next
week, the models have started showing the potential for an upper
level low to close off over the northern High Plains, but show
considerable uncertainty both on timing and strength. The 18z GFS
is a little faster/farther north and the 12z CMC is still on the
slow side (as it as been the past couple of days). At this time
the 12z ECMWF lies somewhere in the middle. Even still, there's
been enough run to run inconsistencies in all the models that it's
hard to latch on to one deterministic model over another. Thus,
WPC prefers a blend towards the ensemble means for days 6-7. Did
maintain some modest contributions from the ECMWF/GFS even through
the whole period just to add some definition to the washed out
means. Overall, this also maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Tropical cyclone Nicholas will likely be recent memory by the
start of this forecast but some of the models indicate the
potential for remnant tropical moisture to interact with a
lingering convergence boundary bringing additional light to
moderate rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast, in regions which
have already or may receive heavy rainfall as Nicholas moves
through. The details on the specifics however remain very
uncertain. To the north, rainfall will impact the Eastern U.S.
this weekend ahead of a front progressing through the region,
while showers and storms linger over the Southeast for a couple
more days within an area of weakness in the upper levels. Out
West, an atmospheric river set up should be in place as the period
starts on Saturday bringing continued heavy rainfall to parts of
the Pacific Northwest, with some snow possible in the higher
elevations. As the trough amplifies and shifts inland early next
week, so should the moisture and rainfall changes with the best
chance for heavy precipitation along the favorable terrain.

The amplified troughing  over the West will allow for cooler
temperatures over the Northwest. Daily highs will average 10-15F
or more below normal beyond this weekend with gradual expansion
into the Northern Rockies as surface high pressure settles in
behind the front. A warming trend in temperatures is expected from
the Plains to the Northeast within a building ridge aloft. Warmest
anomalies of possibly +10-20F should shift from the
Northern/Central Plains this weekend and into the Upper Midwest
and Great Lakes Monday-Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
Strengthening mid-level flow is forecast to expand southward across
the Northwest and northern Rockies through the day today as a trough
amplifies over southwest Canada. At the surface, a surface low is
expected to move rapidly east across Canada with a trailing dryline
extending southward into portions of the northern Plains. This
dryline will move rapidly east through the day with dry and breezy
conditions expected in its wake.

...Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains...
A combination of the tightening pressure gradient and a deeply mixed
airmass transporting stronger mid-level flow to the surface should
lead to gusty surface winds across much of the northern Rockies and
northern Plains. A dry airmass should be in place with relative
humidity around 10 to 15 percent across the Great Basin and Wyoming
and 15 to 20 percent across Montana and North Dakota. Therefore,
elevated fire weather concerns are expected across much of this
region this afternoon/early evening.

...Portions of the Columbia Basin...
Strengthening onshore flow is expected today with flow compressed
through the Cascade Gaps. The strongest winds are expected through
the Columbia River Gorge and into the western Columbia Basin. Enough
heating is also expected in this area for relative humidity to drop
below 15 percent. Fuels are starting to dry out in the area (ERC
around 80th percentile) but are only critically dry in localized
areas. However, the winds are strong enough and the relative
humidity is low enough that an elevated fire weather area is
justified.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0114 AM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow (> 50 mph) is expected across Idaho, Montana,
and northern Wyoming on Thursday. Farther southwest, flow is
expected to be weaker, but still above 25 mph across the remainder
of the Great Basin and central Rockies.

...Great Basin into northwest Colorado and western Wyoming and the
Snake River Plain...
Deep boundary layer mixing is forecast across much of the Great
Basin and central Rockies on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, surface
winds are expected to increase where there is stronger flow aloft
from southern Nevada across Utah and into western Wyoming. Relative
humidity is expected to be in the 8 to 14 percent range across this
entire region. This deep mixing and stronger surface flow will also
extend into favored areas within the Snake River Plain where
elevated to possibly critical conditions are anticipated.

...Eastern Montana into far Western Colorado...
A surface cold front will usher in a cooler and much more moist
airmass across much of Montana and the northern Plains. However, a
pocket of drier air is forecast to arrive across eastern Montana and
far western North Dakota during peak heating with relative humidity
dropping below 20 percent in some locations. In addition, winds are
expected to be strong across most of this area with widespread
sustained wind speeds above 20 mph. Therefore, some elevated fire
weather conditions are expected Thursday afternoon and evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1040 AM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Morning observations and recent guidance continue to support the
previous forecast (below). Elevated conditions remain most likely in
the lee of the Sierra along the CA/NV border. Uncertainty in the
duration and coverage of 15+ mph winds further east into NV remains
too low for an eastward expansion.

..Moore.. 08/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow is expected to develop across the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Great Basin today. Enhancement of
mid-level winds across the northern Sierra will likely promote an
area of elevated fire weather in the immediate lee of the terrain.
With the surface pressure pattern expected to be rather benign,
these conditions are not expected to be widespread. It is possible,
however, that locally elevated conditions could occur in parts of
central Oregon into northeastern Nevada.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 PM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

The forecast outlined below generally remains on track. Recent
guidance shows a slight downward trend in wind magnitudes, which
further reduces confidence in the eastern extent of the risk areas
across NV. However, critical conditions remain likely in the
immediate lee of the Sierra. Elevated conditions are probable across
eastern ID and western WY, but ERC values are generally below
seasonal normal values, suggesting modest fuel readiness.

..Moore.. 08/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Sun Aug 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level winds will increase across the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Great Basin on Monday. With the surface pressure gradient
also increasing, areas of critical fire weather are possible.

...Northern Nevada...
Sustained 20 mph winds are most likely to occur in the lee of the
northern Sierra. These strong downslope winds will aid low-level
drying. Afternoon RH may dip below 10% locally with most areas
reaching 10-15%. Elevated conditions are likely to extend into parts
of north-central and northeast Nevada as wind speeds will only reach
15-20 mph.

...Columbia Gorge...Cascade Gaps...
The strongest mid-level winds are expected to occur across Oregon
and Washington. With a surface trough in the Columbia Basin, strong
westerly winds are likely within the Columbia Gorge and the Cascade
gaps. There is spread in guidance as to how low RH will fall (some
models showing areas below 20%), though 20-25% seems most probable
immediately downstream of the terrain features. The RH uncertainty
and marginal fuels indicate and elevated fire risk despite 20-25 mph
winds.

Valid 12Z Wed Sep 01 2021 - 12Z Sun Sep 05 2021

...Ida Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat continuing into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Thursday...

...Nora lead moisture to fuel a Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat
mid-later week...

...Emerging locally heavy convective rainfall pattern for the
Northern Plains/Upper Midwest mid-later week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest guidance continues to struggle with timing of Ida as
she begins her extratropical cyclone transition and exits the
Northeast Coast Wednesday into Thursday. The 12z UKMET/00z ECMWF
remain on the slower side of the envelope to exit the coast, while
the 06z/12z GFS and CMC are faster. The ensemble means generally
fall somewhere in the middle, also consistent with the official
NHC track, at least through day 5. Elsewhere, no major differences
to note. There are some uncertainties with structure/timing of an
upper low in central Canada which impacts details of QPF and
frontal structure/timing across the north-central U.S. into next
weekend.

This cycle of the WPC forecast relied more heavily on the
deterministic models the first half of the period with more
emphasis towards the 00z ECMWF which was closest to the latest Ida
track from NHC. After day 5, the forecast trended quickly towards
the ensemble means which helps mitigate the detail differences
across the northern tier states. This approach maintained good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Dangerous Hurricane Ida made landfall this afternoon over
southeast Louisiana. By the start of the medium range period on
Wednesday, Ida should be transitioning to a post/extra tropical
cyclone as it moves across the Mid-Atlantic off the coast on
Thursday. Regardless, a heavy rainfall threat from Ida will extend
from the eastern Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians to the
Mid-Atlantic and southern portions of the Northeast as leading
deep moisture interacts with a slow moving front draped over the
system. Cell training and terrain will significantly enhance the
runoff and flood threat within a well defined precipitation axis.

The latest track guidance for Tropical Storm Nora brings it
northward along the western Mexico coast, and into Northwest
Mexico and will likely weaken rather quickly as it interacts with
the Mexican terrain. Leading deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora
will continue to fuel a Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat into the
start of the period on Wednesday. There remains some uncertainties
regarding how fast Nora degenerates and that certainly would have
implications for total rainfall across the Southwest. Moisture
from Nora may also bring moderate to locally heavy, and terrain
enhanced, rains into parts of the central Rockies as well.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy and modestly unsettling/cooling front down from the
Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and genesis mid-later
week out across the Rockies to the north-central U.S. will
increasingly focus an enhanced convection/rainfall pattern that
should focus locally heavy convection/rainfall as enhanced by
embedded impulses and frontal/wave reinforcements.
Moisture/instability pooling and height falls will likely support
some locally strong to severe convection and heavy downpours
across the Dakotas and into the Upper Mississippi Valley Thursday
and Friday.

...Ida Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat continuing into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Thursday...

...Nora lead moisture to fuel a Southwest U.S. heavy rain threat
mid-later week...

...Emerging locally heavy convective rainfall pattern for the
Northern Plains/Upper Midwest mid-later week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest guidance continues to struggle with timing of Ida as
she begins her extratropical cyclone transition and exits the
Northeast Coast Wednesday into Thursday. The 12z UKMET/00z ECMWF
remain on the slower side of the envelope to exit the coast, while
the 06z/12z GFS and CMC are faster. The ensemble means generally
fall somewhere in the middle, also consistent with the official
NHC track, at least through day 5. Elsewhere, no major differences
to note. There are some uncertainties with structure/timing of an
upper low in central Canada which impacts details of QPF and
frontal structure/timing across the north-central U.S. into next
weekend.

This cycle of the WPC forecast relied more heavily on the
deterministic models the first half of the period with more

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun August 29 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Category-4 Hurricane Ida ravaging southeastern Louisiana before
weakening and turning north and northeast across the lower
Mississippi Valley and into the Tennessee Valleys...

...Heavy rain and initially hurricane-force wind gusts expected to
spread across  Mississippi toward the Tennessee Valleys during the
next couple of days...

...Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over the Great Lakes into
tonight, then across the northern Plains on Monday...

...Excessive heat over parts of southern California and the Desert
Southwest into Monday; then watching moisture from Tropical Storm
Nora begins to arrive on Tuesday...

Hurricane Ida rapidly intensified into a category-4 hurricane
early this morning before making landfall near Port Fourchon,
Louisiana around midday today with 150-mph sustained winds.
Weakening ensures as Ida is forecast to move further inland across
southeastern Louisiana into this evening.  Ida possesses a
relatively large circulation with multiple intense rainbands
around its circulation.  Widespread hurricane-force wind gusts
appear likely to spread further inland tonight together with
extended periods of heavy rain.  The high wind gusts could spread
into Mississippi on Monday as Ida is forecast to turn
north-northeastward.    Additionally, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe weather for tornado potential associated with IDA.

Ida will slowly start to weaken after landfall while moving
northward into the Tennessee Valley by Tuesday.  The excessive
rainfall threat will be Moderate over parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys through Tuesday evening into
Wednesday.  The severe weather threat will continue for tornado
potential associated with IDA through Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, a front over the Upper Great Lakes into the Central
Rockies will move eastward, moving off the Northeast Coast and
extending across the Ohio/Middle Mississippi Valleys into the
Northern High Plains by Tuesday. Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the boundary from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast by Monday. As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Great Lakes
through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm threat
will weaken slightly over the Northeast on Monday into Tuesday
morning.  Showers and thunderstorms will continue along and near
the front from parts of the Northern/Central Plains into the
Ohio/Middle Mississippi Valley on Monday into Tuesday. As a
result, there will be a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Middle Missouri Valley on Monday into Tuesday.

Elsewhere, upper-level impulses and diurnal heating will produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southwest into the
Southern Plains from the late afternoon into the late evening on
Sunday and Monday. Additionally, heat will also produce hazards.
Therefore, Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect over Southern
California into parts of the Southwest through Monday.

Hurricane Ida rapidly intensified into a category-4 hurricane
early this morning before making landfall near Port Fourchon,
Louisiana around midday today local time with 150-mph sustained
winds.  Weakening ensures as Ida is forecast to move further
inland across southeastern Louisiana into this evening.  Ida
possesses a relatively large circulation with concentric eyewalls
around its core and multiple intense rainbands around its outer
circulation.  Widespread hurricane-force wind gusts appear likely
to spread further inland tonight together with extended periods of
heavy rain.  The high wind gusts could spread further north across
Mississippi on Monday as Ida is forecast to turn
north-northeastward.  Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk mainly for isolated tornadoes for areas
east of the lower Mississippi Valley into tonight.

As Ida tracks further to the north and northeast during the next
couple of days, a cold front is forecast to drop south across the
Ohio Valley.  The increasing interaction between the two systems
will likely result in multiple inches of rain, leading to an
increasing threat of flash flooding into Tennessee Valleys through
Tuesday--especially where antecedent heavy rain has recently
occurred.  In addition, isolated tornadoes remain possible through
Tuesday ahead of Ida.

Ahead of the aforementioned cold front, showers and thunderstorms
could become severe over parts of the upper Great Lakes into
tonight, where strong wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes are
possible.  Scattered thunderstorms can be expected across the
Northeast on Monday ahead of this same front but cool air and
clearing skies are expected to arrive on Tuesday following frontal
passage.  Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms north of the
trailing portion of this front could become severe later on Monday
across parts of the northern Plains towards the mid-Mississippi
Valley where excessive rainfall will be possible as well.

Meanwhile, much of the western U.S. will remain dry through
Tuesday.  The exception will be across the higher terrains of
Arizona and New Mexico where some late-day monsoonal showers and
thunderstorms can be expected.  The Desert Southwest will remain
quite hot into Monday where Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat
Warnings remain in effect.  By Tuesday, moisture from tropical
cyclone Nora near the west coast of Mexico could begin to stream
into the Desert Southwest, bringing a increasing threat of heavy
rain into the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Mon Aug 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWESTERN NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level winds will be on the increase across the Northwest into
the northern Great Basin today. At the surface, a trough will
develop within the Columbia Basin southward into northern
California. Modest lee troughing will also occur in the northern
High Plains.

...Southern Oregon into the northern Sierra...
Critical fire weather appears likely within the immediate lee of the
northern Sierra and southern Cascades. The southern fringe of the
stronger mid-level winds will be aided by downslope enhancement to
promote 20-25 mph winds. RH of around 10% is probable by afternoon.
Elevated conditions will also occur into southern Oregon and
northern Nevada. Winds in those locations are expected to be weaker
and RH may be slightly higher, particularly in Oregon.

...Columbia Basin Region...
Strong winds are likely through the Cascade gaps as well as the
Columbia Gorge. Terrain-favored areas could see 20-25 mph winds.
Winds out onto the Basin will generally range from 15-20 mph. There
is some question about the extent of low RH given some potential
influence of marine air. However, 15-20% is probable within the
Basin with perhaps 20-25% within the gaps and Gorge. Fire weather
concerns will be elevated.

...Idaho/Wyoming...
Locally elevated conditions are possible as mid-level flow increases
and the lee trough deepens in the northern High Plains. With fuels
that are near seasonal average dryness and dry/windy conditions that
may be relatively brief, no highlights will be added this outlook.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Mon Aug 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
The mid-level trough will continue east on Tuesday. The strongest
mid-level winds will exist across Idaho into western and central
Montana. Moderately strong flow will still remain across the
northern Great Basin on the southern flank of the trough. At the
surface, a cold front is expected to push through the Northwest and
into the far northern Great Basin. A lee cyclone will deepen in
eastern Nevada.

...Northern Nevada...
With a similar pattern to Monday, critical fire weather is again
expected during the afternoon. Moderately strong mid-level winds
will combine with enhanced surface winds ahead of the approaching
front. 20-25 mph sustained winds are expected in the lee of the
terrain with 15-20 mph winds extending farther east into northeast
Nevada.

...Idaho/Montana...
Winds from southern Idaho into southwest Montana could reach near 20
mph. Though surface conditions will be dry, fuels remain marginally
receptive to fire spread. No highlights will be added this outlook.

...Ida Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat to spread from the
Mid-Atlantic to Southern New England Thursday...

...Nora lead moisture to fuel Southwest U.S./Rockies Heavy Rain
threat into Thursday...

...Emerging late week locally heavy convective rainfall pattern
for the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered but smoothed guidance
from the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means, the NBM and with infusion with
the latest implications from NHC tropical tracks for Nora and Ida.
Individual models are beginning to offer some more common trends
into medium range time scales, but still differ enough from run to
run to favor the more ensemble mean forecast approach that offers
better continuity in a pattern with near normal predictability.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

By Thursday and into Friday, Ida as a still well organized
post/extra tropical cyclone is forecast by the NHC to lift from
the Mid-Atlantic to offshore southern New England with uncertain
interaction from northern stream energies. This track would bring
a heavy rainfall threat fueled by deep wrapping moisture in a
favorable right entrance region of a potent upper jet. Cell
training and terrain will significantly enhance the runoff/flood
threat within a well defined precipitation axis.

The latest track guidance for Nora brings it northward along the
western Mexico coast and into Northwest Mexico where it will
weaken rather quickly as it interacts with the terrain. Leading
deep tropical moisture ahead of Nora will fuel a lingering
Southwest U.S./Rockies heavy rain threat into Thursday.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy and modestly unsettling/cooling front through the West
and downstream across the north-central states. Upper dynamics and
frontal convergence/progression should act to focus some locally
heavy convection/rainfall as enhanced by embedded impulses/frontal
waves as fueled by instability and frontal moisture pooling,
including some monsoonal influx Thursday and Friday.

...Hurricane IDA is forecast to slowly weaken while moving
northeastward with a Slight Risk of severe weather for tornado
potential over parts of the Central Gulf Coast through Tuesday
morning...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall associated with
IDA over the Central Gulf Coast and Tennessee Valley that will
travel along with the IDA=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs circulation into the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through Thursday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Northern/Central Plains and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over the Middle Missouri Valley and parts of the Ohio Valley
through Tuesday morning...

...The excessive rainfall threat increases over the Southwest into
the Central Rockies as former T. C. NORA=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDS moisture moves =
over
the region...

Hurricane IDA is slowly forecast to weaken to a Tropical Storm
then a Tropical Depression while moving northeastward into parts
of the Ohio Valley on Wednesday then into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast late Wednesday into early Thursday morning.
The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather for tornado
potential over parts of the Central Gulf Coast through Tuesday
morning. The hazard will be for isolated tornados that will
develop with the areas of heavy rain. Furthermore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with areas of heavy
rain associated with IDA. The threat of excessive rainfall will be
over the Central Gulf Coast and Tennessee Valley on Monday into
Tuesday. Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall associated with
IDA=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs circulation will travel along the system=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs track as IDA
moves northeastward. The threat will be over parts of the
Tennessee/Southern Ohio Valley into the Central Appalachians on
Tuesday into Wednesday morning. The focus for excessive rainfall
will move to the Central Appalachians/northern Mid-Atlantic and
the Northeast on Wednesday into Thursday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash flooding.
Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers along the track through Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Lower Upper Great Lakes to
the Central High Plains will move eastward, moving off the
Northeast Coast and extending across the Ohio/Middle Mississippi
Valleys into the Northern High Plains by Tuesday morning. Showers
and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the boundary
from the Great Lakes/Northeast into the Central Plains on Monday.
Some thunderstorms will become severe over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains.  As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central
Plains through Tuesday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or
great hail over the area. Finally, heavy rain will develop along
different regions of the front on Monday.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms over the Middle Missouri Valley and parts of the
Ohio Valley through Tuesday morning.  The associated heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Tuesday morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat will weaken slightly over the
Middle Missouri Valley on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.  Showers
and thunderstorms will continue along and near the front from
parts of the Northern/Central Plains into the Ohio/Middle
Mississippi Valley on Tuesday into Wednesday. The excessive
rainfall threat will decrease slightly over the Middle Mississippi
Valley on Tuesday into Wednesday.

Elsewhere, moisture associated with what was once Tropical Cyclone
NORA will move over the Southwest into parts of the Great Basin
and Central Rockies on Tuesday into Wednesday, producing
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.

The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable Tuesday into Wednesday morning.  Additionally,
heat will also produce hazards. Therefore, Excessive Heat Warnings
are in effect over Southern California into parts of the Southwest
through Monday. In addition, the fire weather threat has increased
over the Northwest into the Northern Rockies as Red Flag Warnings
have been issued over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California as well as parts of Idaho and Wyoming.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CST Fri Nov 19 2021

Valid 191700Z - 201200Z

The previous forecast for the southern High Plains remains on track,
with only minor adjustments made to the Elevated delineation to
reflect the latest guidance consensus. Please see the previous
forecast below for details on the southern High Plains
wildfire-spread threat. Otherwise, locally dry northerly flow may
accompany the post-cold frontal environment across portions of the
Carolinas into southern Georgia as high pressure continues to settle
in across the region. However, the localized nature of the dry and
breezy conditions and poor fuel receptiveness to fire spread
precludes any fire weather highlights.

..Squitieri.. 11/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CST Fri Nov 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal midlevel flow is expected over the southern Rockies and High
Plains today. A surface low is forecast to develop over parts of the
central High Plains, with a lee trough extending southward into
eastern CO and the TX/OK Panhandles.

...Southern High Plains...
Southerly flow will increase this afternoon across the southern High
Plains in response to the developing lee trough, but low-level
moisture will remain limited. Diurnal heating and mixing will
support minimum RH values of 15-20% across parts of the TX Panhandle
into western OK, as surface winds increase to 20-25 mph. Farther
west across parts of eastern NM, diurnal warming and drying
resulting from westerly downslope flow will support minimum RH
values of around 15%, as surface winds increase to 15-20 mph. These
conditions will support an elevated fire-weather threat.

Farther north into parts of southern/eastern Colorado, locally
elevated conditions will be possible across terrain-favored areas
where somewhat stronger downslope winds may develop. However,
confidence in a sufficient coverage and duration of elevated
conditions remains low at this time.

...Departing east coast system to produce heavy rainfall in
eastern Maine Monday night and anomalously cold temperatures in
the Southeast through early next week...

...Increasing confidence in Thanksgiving/Black Friday heavy
rainfall event for portions of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An amplifying trough in the eastern U.S. will see out a pair of
coastal surface low pressure systems into the Canadian maritime at
the beginning of our medium range period (Monday and Tuesday).
Upper-level ridging will shift into the central U.S. before a
northern Pacific trough phases with a cut-off low west of the
California coast, and amplifies over the Southwest on Tuesday. The
new trough may split back into separate streams heading into
midweek as the southern energy digs into Mexico and the northern
wave rides the upper jet across the northern/central tier of the
country.

The latest guidance is in agreement with the timing of a departing
upper-level trough in the East on Monday-Tuesday. Some run-to-run
variability exists between GFS members as they struggle with
deciding whether to generate a closed upper-low or not. The 00z
CMC attempts to retrograde a pair of closed upper-lows over the
Northeast by Thanksgiving, which is out of step with the other
deterministics. The ensemble means, save for the Canadian, handle
the timing and intensity of the departing system fairly well.
Unfortunately, this doesn't translate well to the surface for the
GFS as its 06z run attempts to drag the surface low back toward
the New England coast by Thursday while the 00z run keeps it out
to sea with the rest of the models.

Models have trended stronger with the Pacific energy approaching
the West Coast on Monday. We begin to get more pronounced spread
by Wednesday as deterministics like the 06z GFS and 00z UKMET
begin to deviate from the enemble means by slowing and
strengthening the upper-low. All of the operational models have
trended toward a deepening closed low feature over northern Mexico
by Thanksgiving day. That being said, the ensemble means appear to
be our best bet for determining the 500mb pattern over the
Southwest and Great Plains toward the tail end of the medium range
period.

Medium range progs used a general deterministic model blend with
heavier weighting toward the 06z GFS and 00z UKMET on days 3 and
4. By day 5 the 06z GFS weighting was reduced in favor of its 00z
predecessor due to the 06z's trouble resolving the Atlantic low,
and ensemble means were added to the blend. This blend ratio
continues through days 6 & 7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The Northeast low pressure will bring a cold front into and
through the East on Monday with much of the heaviest precipitation
heading off the East Coast. Moderate to heavy rainfall should
continue into parts of New England though with the heaviest totals
(in excess of an inch) across far eastern Maine on Monday aided by
strong Atlantic inflow. Cold air filtering in behind the system
should support at least light accumulating snow downwind of the
lower Great Lakes as well as along westward-facing terrain from
the central Appalachians and northeastward. There is still enough
uncertainty in system evolution to allow for other possibilities
regarding precipitation type and amounts, even into parts of far
northern New England. Deepening low pressure should allow for a
period of breezy/gusty winds across much of the East Monday and
Tuesday and possibly into the middle and latter parts of the week
across the Northeast as low pressure lingers offshore. Daytime
highs and morning lows Monday and Tuesday could be 10-20 degrees
below normal from portions of the Ohio Valley/Midwest into the
Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast. Near to below freezing morning
lows could extend rather far into parts of the South which may
impact sensitive soils. For northern locations, this combination
of cold temperatures and gusty winds could make for some
unpleasant wind chills during the upcoming Holiday week.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. By mid week, the western front
should reach far enough into the Plains to begin interacting with
Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area of moderate to possibly
heavy rainfall from eastern Texas into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley for Wednesday and especially into Thanksgiving
day, before shifting focus to the central Gulf coast.

Above normal temperatures ahead of the western front will march
from the Rockies to the Plains Monday-Wednesday with anomalies +10
to +15F possible. Modestly above normal temperatures are possible
into the Southern Plains and Midwest on Thursday, with
temperatures generally near or slightly above average across the
West upper level ridging attemps to build over the region.
Temperatures will drop again for this region by Friday as the cold
front associated with the low pressure system propagates through.

...Departing east coast system to produce heavy rainfall in
eastern Maine Monday night and anomalously cold temperatures in
the Southeast through early next week...

...Increasing confidence in Thanksgiving/Black Friday heavy
rainfall event for portions of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An amplifying trough in the eastern U.S. will see out a pair of
coastal surface low pressure systems into the Canadian maritime at
the beginning of our medium range period (Monday and Tuesday).
Upper-level ridging will shift into the central U.S. before a
northern Pacific trough phases with a cut-off low west of the
California coast, and amplifies over the Southwest on Tuesday. The
new trough may split back into separate streams heading into
midweek as the southern energy digs into Mexico and the northern
wave rides the upper jet across the northern/central tier of the
country.

The latest guidance is in agreement with the timing of a departing
upper-level trough in the East on Monday-Tuesday. Some run-to-run
variability exists between GFS members as they struggle with
deciding whether to generate a closed upper-low or not. The 00z
CMC attempts to retrograde a pair of closed upper-lows over the
Northeast by Thanksgiving, which is out of step with the other
deterministics. The ensemble means, save for the Canadian, handle
the timing and intensity of the departing system fairly well.
Unfortunately, this doesn't translate well to the surface for the
GFS as its 06z run attempts to drag the surface low back toward
the New England coast by Thursday while the 00z run keeps it out
to sea with the rest of the models.

Models have trended stronger with the Pacific energy approaching
the West Coast on Monday. We begin to get more pronounced spread
by Wednesday as deterministics like the 06z GFS and 00z UKMET
begin to deviate from the enemble means by slowing and
strengthening the upper-low. All of the operational models have
trended toward a deepening closed low feature over northern Mexico
by Thanksgiving day. That being said, the ensemble means appear to
be our best bet for determining the 500mb pattern over the
Southwest and Great Plains toward the tail end of the medium range
period.

Medium range progs used a general deterministic model blend with
heavier weighting toward the 06z GFS and 00z UKMET on days 3 and
4. By day 5 the 06z GFS weighting was reduced in favor of its 00z
predecessor due to the 06z's trouble resolving the Atlantic low,
and ensemble means were added to the blend. This blend ratio
continues through days 6 & 7.

The Elevated area across the southern High Plains was expanded
further eastward into the Texas Panhandle. Here, the latest guidance
consensus has trended somewhat windier, with modest potential of
sustained 15 mph surface westerly surface winds overlapping with
15-20% RH by afternoon peak heating.

Otherwise, an Elevated area was added across southern California,
from the Santa Ynez to Laguna Mountain Ranges towards the end of the
period. While the most favorable surface wind/RH overlap associated
with offshore flow is still expected to occur after 12Z Sunday, at
least locally to potentially widespread Elevated conditions may
begin between 06-09Z based on some of the latest high-resolution
model guidance.

..Squitieri.. 11/19/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CST Fri Nov 19 2021/

...Synopsis...
A continuation of zonal midlevel flow is expected across the
southern Plains on Saturday. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will
gradually build into the Great Basin, as a trough develops south of
the ridge off the coast of southern California toward the end of the
period.

...Portions of eastern New Mexico into adjacent parts of West
Texas...

Persistent downslope flow across eastern New Mexico will continue to
support elevated fire weather conditions, with minimum RH values
around 15% and sustained surface winds of 15 to 20 mph expected.
There is some uncertainty regarding how far east elevated conditions
will spread into the Texas South Plains, and some adjustments may be
possible in future outlooks.

...Southern California...

Late in the period, offshore flow is expected to develop over
portions of southern California. Locally elevated conditions are
possible, but the greatest threat is not expected until later in the
day on Sunday, when more substantial RH reductions are expected.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 19 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is decent multi-model agreement of the ensemble means
indicating an amplified mid-level ridge-trough pattern across the lower 48
states during week-2. However, the 0Z GEFS indicates a greater potential fo=
r
the ridging over the western lower 48 to break down during the period. A
surface low is forecast to develop along the western Gulf Coast before movi=
ng
eastward to northeastward early in the period, which may bring heavy
precipitation to parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.
Amplified mid-level low pressure is predicted to prevail over Alaska
throughout
week-2, bringing anomalously cool temperatures to the Mainland. A series of
surface lows over the Gulf of Alaska may bring heavy precipitation to the
Alaska Panhandle during the first few days of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of southwestern
Mainland Alaska, Sat-Sun, Nov 27-28.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the Seward Peninsula a=
nd
parts of the southern Lisburne Peninsula in western Mainland Alaska, Sat-Mo=

Nov 27-29.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation in the Pacific Northwest, Sat-Sun, Nov 2=

FOR SATURDAY NOVEMBER 27 - FRIDAY DECEMBER 03: There continues to be great
uncertainty in the evolution of the jet stream pattern across western North
America during week-2. The GEFS indicates a complete breakdown of mid-level
high pressure over the western U.S., which would result in a southward shif=
t
of
the storm track during the period. Conversely, the ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles
strongly indicate that mid-level high pressure will prevail through much of
week-2 before weakening late in the period, preventing the storm track from
shifting farther southward. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance agree
regarding an increased potential for an atmospheric river event during the
first couple of days in week-2, Nov 27-28, warranting a slight risk of heav=
y
precipitation for northeastern Oregon and western Washington. The duration =
of
the slight risk hazard is greatly reduced compared to yesterday's forecast,
given the uncertainty related to the evolution of the storm track across th=
e
western lower 48 beyond day 9. In addition, the Pacific Northwest has seen
marked improvements to soil moisture from a persistent Fall storm track, so
increased runoff remains a concern.



Leading up to the start of week-2, surface high pressure near southeastern
Atlantic Coast is expected to enhance return flow on its western periphery,
aiding in the development of surface low pressure along the western Gulf
Coast.
There is some uncertainty in the timing and track of this system among the
model guidance, with the ECMWF ensemble progressing this system eastward mo=
re
quickly, but given the consistency in both models developing a robust surfa=
ce
low over the region, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for Sat=
,
Nov 27.



Models have maintained amplified mid-level troughing across Mainland Alaska
from the beginning to middle of the period for the past few days, supportin=
g a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the western
Mainland. The slight risk of much below normal temperatures posted for the
southwestern Mainland covers the first two days of the week-2 period (Sat-S=
un,
Nov 27-28), as temperatures are expected to moderate enough to remain below
hazardous thresholds beyond day 9. Much below normal temperatures are expec=
ted
to linger slightly longer from the Seward Peninsula northward, warranting a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures through day 10 (Sat-Mon, Nov
27-29). Reforecast tools support both slight risk areas, as both the GEFS a=
nd
ECMWF tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling =
to
the lowest 15th percentile and below zero Deg F.



There is good multi-model agreement in the formation of a couple of strong
surface lows over the Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the period (Sat-Mo=
n,
Nov 27-29), which could bring heavy precipitation to parts of the Alaska
Panhandle. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Alaska
Panhandle, Nov 27-29, where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance=
 of
exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches. However, uncertainty increases
beyond day 10 in the precipitation forecast over western North America, due=
 to
differences among the model guidance in the strength and duration of mid-le=
vel
high pressure near the Pacific Northwest.

...Snow showers for the Northern/Central Rockies through Saturday
evening...

...Persistent onshore flow will produce showers and thunderstorms
over the southern third of Florida with a marginal threat for
excessive rainfall...

...Snow for Upper Great Lakes and rain from the Lower Great Lakes
to the Southern Plains/Western Gulf Coast by Sunday evening...

A cold dome of high pressure over the Central Appalachians will
slowly begin to move off the Northeast Coast on Saturday as warmer
air moves northward over the Southern Plains into the Great Lakes
ahead of the next front.

Meanwhile, a front over the Northern Rockies into the Great Basin
moves eastward and strengthens as cold air from Central Canada
moves southward over the Northern Plains on Saturday morning.
Upper-level energy associated with the system will aid in
producing scattered snow showers over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies through Saturday evening.  Also, on
Saturday, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to
moisten the air over the Lower/Middle Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys.  By Saturday evening, the front will be draped from the
Upper Great Lakes southwestward to the Southern High Plains,
moving eastward to the Great Lakes to the Western Gulf Coast as
additional cold air moves southward out of Canada.  On Sunday
morning, rain will develop over parts of the Ohio and Mississippi
Valleys, expanding into the Lower Great Lakes/Northeast and the
Southern High Plains by Sunday evening.  On Sunday morning, as
some of the moisture wraps around the associated surface low over
the Great Lakes, snow will develop over parts of the Upper Great
Lakes, continuing into Sunday evening.

Farther south, persistent onshore flow will stream moisture into
Florida, producing showers and thunderstorms through Sunday.  The
associated rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain
expected through Sunday morning. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of southeastern
Florida through Sunday morning.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri November 19 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 25 - 29 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means are in good agreement on the
500-hPa circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period. Models consistently
forecast a large positive 500-hPa height anomaly center over southern
Greenland
and the northern Atlantic during the 6-10 day period, as the North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) is forecast to become negative during late November. A
predicted trough over the eastern CONUS is consistent with a negative NAO.
Models forecast a trough over Alaska and a ridge over the Pacific Coast of =
the
CONUS.

Negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the eastern CONUS favor near to belo=
w
normal temperatures across the eastern half of the CONUS. A predicted mid-
level
ridge near the West Coast and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies
support increased probabilities for above normal temperatures from the west=
ern
CONUS east to the central and northern High Plains. A shortwave trough
crossing
through the Rio Grande Valley leads to increased cloudiness and an increase=
 in
probabilities of below normal temperatures for parts of southeastern New
Mexico
and Texas. Below normal temperatures are favored for much of western Alaska
and
the Aleutians, under a predicted trough and negative 500-hPa height anomali=
es.

A transient shortwave trough in the southern stream favors above normal
precipitation from the Rio Grande Valley eastward to the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic. A predicted 500-hPa ridge supports increased probabilities of
below normal precipitation from California eastward to the Central and
Southern
Rockies. Prevailing surface high pressure favors below normal precipitation
from the Central Plains to the western Great Lakes region. Above normal
precipitation is favored for northern areas of the Pacific Northwest into t=
he
Northern Rockies, ahead of onshore mid-level flow. Slightly elevated
probabilities for below normal precipitation for western Mainland Alaska ar=
e
consistent with this anomalously cold pattern. Onshore flow favors above
normal
precipitation for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, although precipitation amounts are expected to be small for
interior
regions of Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on the 500-hPa anomaly circulation pattern, offset by
some
disagreement among the temperature and precipitation forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 27 - DEC 03, 2021

Model forecasts largely persist the circulation pattern predicted for the 6=
-10
day period into week 2. The trough over Alaska de-amplifies somewhat in wee=
k
2,
while the predicted ridge over the western CONUS broadens and 500-hPa heigh=
ts
extend further eastward into the Great Plains. A trough persists over the
eastern CONUS.

Above normal temperatures are favored for most of the western half of the
CONUS, under a mid-level ridge. Below normal temperature probabilities are
increased in the southeastern CONUS, behind the mean trough axis along the
East
Coast. Below normal temperatures continue to be favored for western and
central
Alaska as the trough over the state de-amplifies.

Above normal precipitation is favored from Washington state eastward to the
northern Rockies and Northern High Plains, ahead of enhanced onshore flow,
while below normal precipitation remains more likely from California eastwa=
rd
across the Southwest. As a shortwave trough ejects eastward, precipitation =
is
expected to time off around the start of the 8-14 day period for the Rio
Grande
Valley, western Gulf Coast, and Lower Mississippi Valley, where below norma=
l
precipitation is now favored. Below normal precipitation is favored across
most
of the southern central CONUS to the Appalachians, under anomalous northerl=
y
flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of southeastern coast=
al
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, supported by dynamical model precipitation
tools. Below normal precipitation is favored for southwestern Mainland Alas=
ka,
under easterly to northeasterly surface flow to the northwest of mean surfa=
ce
low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
increasing uncertainty among the temperature and precipitation tools and
evolution of the flow pattern during the period.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...Potential heavy rainfall for portions of the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley may impact travel for the
Thanksgiving holiday...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An amplifying trough over the East Coast to start the period on
Tuesday will eventually close off an upper low off the Northeast
Coast which may linger for a couple of days before finally
weakening and drifting northward. Meanwhile, a Western U.S. trough
may split into two seperate streams with southern energy digging
into Mexico/the southern Plains and northern stream energy sliding
across the Northern Plains and Great Lakes. This energy may
eventually combine with a shortwave in central Canada to form a
possible closed low over eastern Canada next weekend.

Models continue to show good agreement on the departing trough
across the East with lingering questions mainly surrounding how
close to the coast the low lingers (CMC closest, GFS farthest
away) or how quickly the energy phases with a shortwave/closed low
into eastern Canada late period. The ensemble means provided a
reasonable middle ground for the second half of the week.

The guidance continues to show plenty of run to run variability
regarding shortwave energy into the West Coast on Tuesday which
should phase with closed low energy southwest of California. There
is good agreement that this new trough should eventually split
into northern/southern stream energy. Previous runs of the
deterministic models indicated potential for a southern stream
closed upper low to form and linger over northern Mexico, but the
most recent runs have somewhat backed off on this scenario now
indicating a bit more progressive of a system, but still impactful
nonetheless. There are still a number of ensemble members
indicating a closed low, so the potential is still there. By days
6-7, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding strength and
timing of this system but the ensemble means seem to handle the
uncertainty well and provided a good starting point for the
forecast. The northern stream energy across the northern Plains
into the Great Lakes is handled relatively well by the
deterministic solutions the first half of the period. Thereafter,
some minor timing differences begin to emerge, but nothing out of
the ordinary for this time range.

The WPC progs used a majority blend of the deterministic solutions
for days 3-5, with more emphasis towards the ensmelbe means days
6-7 to help mitigate the forecast uncertainties. This approach
maintains good continuity with the previous WPC forecast for days
3-6.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The cold front associated with the Northeast low pressure should
be well off the Atlantic coast by Tuesday with sprawling high
pressure in its wake across much of the eastern third of the
nation. As a result, daytime highs and morning lows Tuesday and
Wednesday could be 10-20 degrees below normal from portions of the
Tennessee/Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and the Southeast.
Near to below freezing morning lows could extend rather far into
parts of the South, resulting in the potential for the first frost
or freeze for some locations, most certainly impacting sensitive
vegetation. Low pressure lingering off the Northeat Coast may
bring periods of breezy/gusty winds to parts of New England and
combined with already chilly temperatures coule make for some
unpleasant wind chills during at least the beginning of next week.

The Pacific Northwest into northern Rockies should see mostly
light to perhaps locally moderate precipitation during the first
half of next week with a shortwave/cold front arriving from the
Pacific. The combination of this energy aloft and the
opening/progression of the upper low southwest of California may
spread some moisture into other parts of the West by
Tuesday/Wednesday, but still with modest confidence for
precipitation coverage/amounts. By mid week, the associated cold
front should reach far enough into the Plains to begin interacting
with Gulf moisture to produce an expanding area of moderate to
possibly heavy rainfall from eastern Texas into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley for Wednesday and especially into Thanksgiving
day, before shifting focus to the central Gulf coast on Friday.
Some models show the potential for several inches of rain.
Additional shortwave energy into the Pacific Northwest may also
bring another round of moderate to locally heavy coastal rain and
mountain snows on Thursday and Friday. For both regions, the south
and Pacific Northwest, this rainfall could impact travel for the
busy Thanksgiving holiday.

Above normal temperatures ahead of the western front will across
the Plains Tuesday-Wednesday with anomalies +10 to +20F possible.
Much of the country looks to be generally near normal on Thursday,
though modestly above normal temperatures may begin to spread
across the West by later in the week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CST Sat Nov 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN CA...

...Synopsis...
A surface ridge will persist over the Great Basin, supporting
moderate to locally strong offshore flow over southern CA. Farther
east, a cold front will move southward across the southern High
Plains, with relatively cool, dry and breezy conditions possible in
its wake.

...Southern CA...

As offshore winds strengthen through the first part of the day on
Sunday, downslope flow and diurnal heating will result in the
development of critical RH across parts of southern CA. Winds of 20
to 30 mph with higher gusts will be possible, especially across
terrain-favored areas and possibly to the coast across parts of
Ventura County. Critical conditions may persist into the overnight
hours owing to poor RH recoveries and the continuation of sufficient
offshore flow.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CST Sat Nov 20 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
Persistent zonal midlevel flow across the southern Rockies into the
southern High Plains will continue today. A weak surface low will
move southeastward over northwest TX as a cold front moves down the
High Plains. Farther west, a surface ridge will gradually build over
the Great Basin, resulting in the development of offshore flow
across southern CA.

...East-central NM into the TX South Plains...

West of the surface low and south of the cold front, dry and breezy
conditions will develop. Downslope flow combined with diurnal
heating and mixing will result in minimum RH around 15% with winds
of 15 to 20 mph. These conditions will support an elevated
fire-weather threat during the afternoon.

...Southern CA...

Offshore winds of greater than 20 mph will begin late in the period
across terrain-favored areas, with a gradual decrease in RH values
overnight. There is some uncertainty in the magnitude of RH
reduction prior to the end of the period, though elevated conditions
appear possible by early Sunday morning with a greater threat
expected later in the day on Sunday.

...Chilly conditions envelope the East today with more seasonal
temps returning by Sunday...

...Heavy showers and thunderstorms possible in South Florida;
accumulating mountain snow in the Rockies today...

...Lake effect snowfall for Upper Great Lakes & rain from the
Northeast to the Deep South Sunday night...

The weekend forecast kicks off with a fairly tranquil Saturday
throughout much of the Lower 48. An expansive dome of high
pressure along the East Coast is responsible for chilly
temperatures and mostly dry conditions. Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories have been issued for parts of the Southeast this
morning for areas witnessing their first frosts and freezes of the
season. Meanwhile, another pair of high pressure systems in the
North-Central and Northwest U.S. will help to keep these regions
dry throughout the weekend. Saturday's most active weather is set
to occur near a frontal boundary draped over central Florida.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms are likely in South Florida
with locally heavy rainfall rates possible. Farther west, a weak
area of low pressure associated with a passing upper level
disturbance will generate mountain snowfall in the Central
Rockies. Lastly, Elevated fire weather conditions are in place for
portions of the southern High Plains and Southern California
today.

By Sunday, a pair of upper level features are set to track through
the Midwest and Ohio Valley. The most vigorous upper level trough
set to pass through the Great Lakes on Sunday will cause a wave of
low pressure to strengthen over southeast Canada. A potent cold
front then delivers a shot of considerably colder temperatures
across the Midwest and Great Lakes late Sunday into Monday,
causing heavy lake effect snow showers to breakout downwind of the
Great Lakes on Monday. Ahead of the storm system's cold front,
numerous showers are forecast to breakout from the Deep South to
the northern Mid-Atlantic Sunday afternoon. Expect these showers
to reach the Northeast and extend as far south as the Southeast
Sunday night. In addition, lingering showers and thunderstorms are
forecast to stick around over South Florida once again on Sunday.
Out west, an intensifying ridge of high pressure means a quiet day
weather-wise throughout much of the region. However, brisk
offshore winds over Southern California mean Santa Ana winds
increase the odds for critical fire weather conditions. Due to
this, Red Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk for fire weather
conditions have been issued near the Southern California coast.

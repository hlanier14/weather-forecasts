Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1120 AM CDT Mon Mar 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEAST ARIZONA INTO
WESTERN TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Current visible satellite
depicts clearing skies across portions of the southern High Plains,
with a sharpening dryline noted (via METAR observations) across
southeast New Mexico into Far West Texas. Behind the dryline,
sustained westerly surface winds have already exceeded 30 mph across
several locales, with gusts over 50 mph. Continued surface heating
should support RH dropping to 5-15% across much of far southern
Arizona/New Mexico into the Trans Pecos region of Texas by afternoon
peak heating, as also supported by the latest guidance consensus.
Several areas may see overlapping Extremely Critical surface wind/RH
criteria for multiple hours this afternoon. Fuels are quite dry,
with 10- and 100hr fuel moisture values dropping below 10%, and
above-average ERCS observed. Nonetheless, ERCs still do not appear
to support extreme fire behavior, precluding the Extremely Critical
upgrade. Still, robust wildfire-spread potential is evident, with
high-end Critical conditions expected through the afternoon.

Otherwise, modestly dry and breezy conditions are expected across
portions of the northern High Plains and northern parts of Lower
Michigan by afternoon peak heating, where fuels are at least
modestly receptive to fire spread. While surface winds/RH are
expected to fall shy of Elevated criteria across these regions, at
least localized wildfire-spread potential will be in place.

..Squitieri.. 03/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Mon Mar 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow will amplify substantially across portions of the
southern Rockies/High Plains as a strong mid/upper wave traverses
New Mexico today.  70-90 kt 500mb wind speeds are expected within a
jet stream expected to traverse the region.  Meanwhile at the
surface, a low will organize over southeastern New Mexico and deepen
quickly upon approach toward southwestern Oklahoma overnight.  To
the west of this low and south of a trailing cold front across
east-central New Mexico, a very dry airmass will reside along with
very windy conditions, potentially promoting rapid fire spread where
fuels are dry.

...Southeastern Arizona through west Texas...
A corridor of very strong surface flow will develop through peak
heating hours across this region.  Latest high-resolution guidance
suggests areas of 30-40 mph surface winds with gusts perhaps as high
as 70 mph especially in favored terrain areas of the TransPecos.
Meanwhile, insolation/heating amidst a very dry airmass will allow
for several areas of 3-15% RH values during the afternoon - lowest
in west Texas.  Ordinarily, these conditions would support an
extremely critical delineation across some portion of west Texas and
far southern New Mexico, though fuels guidance generally depicts
ERCs that may not support extreme fire behavior.  Thus, this upgrade
is withheld, though rapid fire spread will be possible with any
ignitions this afternoon.

149 PM EDT Mon Mar 22 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 25 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 29 2021

...Thursday heavy rain threat most likely centered over parts of
the South...

...Overview...

An unsettled and active weather pattern is forecast to affect much
of the central to eastern U.S. later this week while the Pacific
Northwest will see a couple weather systems approach the area by
late in the weekend and early next week. Ahead of that though,
upper ridging over the Rockies will bring a period of warmer/drier
weather.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic pattern is fairly well clustered over the CONUS,
aside from the 00Z/06Z GFS which is flatter and more progressive
with the shortwave trough over the central U.S. on Thursday. Its
speed/timing issues remain in place throughout the forecast period
and in short, its inclusion in the WPC blend was lowered compared
to the other global models. The 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET offered a
reasonable blend for day 3-4 with the synoptic system affecting
the central/eastern U.S.. All of the models show a fair amount of
ridging developing by this weekend over the western U.S. that
translates toward the central U.S. by early next week, ahead of
the next shortwave trough impacting the Pacific Northwest. Here,
the GFS again is too fast and while the ECMWF was on the slower
side, a ECENS/GEFS heavy blend for day 6-7 seemed to handle the
smaller scale timing differences and also maintains continuity
fairly well.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A surge of warm, moist Gulf of Mexico air will drive more
widespread, organized rainfall along a slow moving frontal
boundary across parts of the South and Eastern states Thursday
into Friday. The heaviest axis of rainfall is expected to fall
from the Central Gulf Coast into the Southern Appalachians and
Tennessee Valley. On the northern, colder side of the system, a
period of light snow from parts of the Great Lakes to interior New
England Friday-Saturday is possible.

The next system dropping through the West will likely bring
another round of mountain snows to the Rockies on Thursday, with a
drier trend through much of the rest of the period as upper level
ridging builds aloft. As this shortwave amplifies and slides
eastward next weekend, the models are hinting at another round of
moderate to heavy rainfall for parts of the Southeast which should
focus along a warm front across the Deep South.

The eastern third of the country will stay warm and above normal
through much of the period, with the greatest anomalies (+15 to
+20F) across the Northeast Thursday and Friday. Morning lows will
be even more so anomalously warm, with several record high minimum
temperatures possible late this week stretching from Florida to
the Northeast. Out West, temperatures should trend warmer after
this week as upper level ridging builds across the region.

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 25 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 29 2021

...Thursday heavy rain threat most likely centered over parts of
the South...

...Overview...

An unsettled and active weather pattern is forecast to affect much
of the central to eastern U.S. later this week while the Pacific
Northwest will see a couple weather systems approach the area by
late in the weekend and early next week. Ahead of that though,
upper ridging over the Rockies will bring a period of warmer/drier
weather.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic pattern is fairly well clustered over the CONUS,
aside from the 00Z/06Z GFS which is flatter and more progressive
with the shortwave trough over the central U.S. on Thursday. Its
speed/timing issues remain in place throughout the forecast period
and in short, its inclusion in the WPC blend was lowered compared
to the other global models. The 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET offered a

the GFS again is too fast and while the ECMWF was on the slower

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: A mid-level trough is forecast to move eastward from the Pacific
Northwest to Maine during Week-2. An associated cold front will likely resu=
lt
in precipitation and slightly below normal temperatures throughout the east=
ern
half of the U.S. during the week, but neither of these is expected to reach
our
hazardous criteria. Several surface cyclones are expected to affect coastal
Alaska during the period, but impacts are also forecast to remain below
hazardous levels.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 25 - MONDAY MARCH 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vg5MjhoO5DYmz9sCYO8RRYxNMnovizVpFMJ2FsHSLpK5UhAmhTioYulJwLLgE=
rGGdjcFnhrH$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 30 - MONDAY APRIL 05: The Week-2 period is forecast to be=
gin
with surface cyclones impacting coastal Alaska, the Northern Plains, and
northern New England. Each of these cyclones will likely result in
precipitation and winds throughout the impacted areas, but the probabilitie=
s
that any of the impacts reaches our hazards criteria are below 20%. The
systems
over the Northern Plains and New England are forecast to lift away by mid-
week,
leaving quiet weather in their wakes.



There are weak indications that temperatures in southwestern Texas could
exceed
the 85th climatological percentile during the middle of Week-2. The
deterministic 00z ECMWF suggests that daily high temperatures could be in t=
he
mid-90s F during this time. However, neither the deterministic GFS nor the
ECMWF ensembles forecast temperatures are this warm, so no associated hazar=
ds
have been posted.



Persistent cyclone activity along Alaska's South Coast is expected to resul=
t
in
wind and precipitation that remains below our hazardous thresholds. In the
longer term, this relatively cool and wet pattern could increase snow water
across the mainland leading to increased flooding concerns during eventual
river ice break up later in April.

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO
INTO FAR WEST TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with only small
modifications made to the Critical area to account for the latest
guidance. Widespread 10-15% RH is expected to coincide with 20 mph
sustained west-southwesterly surface winds and overspread dry fuels
during the afternoon. Otherwise, modestly dry northerly surface
winds may contribute to at least localized wildfire-spread potential
across portions of North Dakota tomorrow afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 03/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Mon Mar 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
On D2/Tue, A longer-wave trough will settle into the Desert
Southwest quickly in the wake of an ejecting trough across the
Plains/mid-Mississippi Valley area.  This will foster continued
enhancement of flow aloft across dry areas of the southern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains.  Fire-weather concerns will be focused
along these areas throughout the forecast period.

...Southeastern Arizona through west Texas...
A generally similar surface flow regime will reside across the
region during the afternoon, with a corridor of westerly surface
flow exceeding 20 mph at times especially across southern New Mexico
and the TransPecos/far west Texas.  This flow will occur within a
continued dry airmass across the region, and surface RH values are
expected to fall to around 3-15% in many areas.  A second
consecutive day of extremely dry atmospheric conditions should help
cure fuels even further, suggesting elevated to critical
fire-weather across the region.  At this time, the critical
delineation highlights areas containing the strongest surface winds
(which may exceed 30 mph at times in the TransPecos) amid critically
dry fuels and very low RH.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon March 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 28 - APR 01, 2021

A generally transient 500-hPa geopotential height pattern is forecast for t=
he
6-10 day period. The most significant features are forecast over the
east-central CONUS, where the 6z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles depict shortwa=
ve
troughs traversing the region during the period. Upstream, across the
remainder
of the CONUS, an oscillating pattern of weak troughs and ridges is forecast=
,
with broad ridging becoming more favored toward the end of the period. Toda=
ys
manual blend depicts negative height anomalies across the Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, and positive height anomalies elsewher=
e
across the CONUS. Anomalous ridging is forecast across much of the central =
and
eastern Pacific, with a series of shortwave troughs predicted to track to t=
he
north of this feature across Alaska. While zonally mean flow is forecast fo=
r
Alaska for the period as a whole, intermittent troughing favors near to bel=
ow
normal heights for most of the Mainland. Above normal heights are forecast
over
the Alaska Peninsula, Panhandle, and the Aleutians.

Prior to the start of the period, a significant warm-up is forecast across
parts of the East. Although the most anomalous warmth is forecast to dimini=
sh
by day-6 as the strongest positive height anomalies move into the Atlantic,
increased southwesterly mid-level flow is still favored ahead of the incomi=
ng
trough. This would result in positive temperature anomalies continuing into
the
early part of the period. As the trough axis passes through, a return to ne=
ar
to possibly slightly below normal temperatures is likely for the East, with
the
GEFS showing a cooler solution compared to the ECMWF and Canadian. This is
also
reflected in the reforecast guidance where the ECMWF tool is substantially
warmer than the GEFS tool. A slight tilt toward above normal temperature
probabilities is highlighted along the Eastern Seaboard, with near normal
temperatures forecast further inland across parts of the Mississippi,
Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and Southeast. There is more
confidence further west, where expanding mid-level ridging favors increasin=
g
above normal temperature probabilities for much of the western and central
CONUS. Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across Alaska,
given the potential for shortwave troughing to lower heights across the sta=
te,
as well as decreased solar heating across the southern part of Alaska and t=
he
Panhandle.

Troughing moving into the eastern CONUS favors increased frontal activity,
along with a potential surface low early in the period over the Northeast. =
As
a
result, probabilities of above normal precipitation are forecast across the
northeastern quadrant of the CONUS. Near to below normal precipitation is
forecast across the rest of the CONUS on the backside of the troughing. The
highest probabilities of below normal precipitation are highlighted along t=
he
Pacific Coast, underneath the greatest influence from the ridge over the
Pacific. Troughing over Alaska and increased westerlies result in above nor=
mal
precipitation chances across the entire state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement in terms of a transient pattern, offset by uncertainty in t=
he
temperature forecast across the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 30 - APR 05, 2021

Troughing is forecast over the East early in the period, but is likely to
moderate with time. Ridging across the Pacific is forecast to weaken, allow=
ing
some of the troughing forecast across Alaska to expand over the northeaster=
n
Pacific. This evolution favors an expansion of broad ridging across the CON=
US,
as depicted in the dynamical model guidance. The manual blend shows above
normal heights for the entire CONUS, with the exceptions of parts of New
England where near normal heights are forecast. Negative height anomalies a=
re
forecast over much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath troughin=
g.
Positive height anomalies remain forecast for the Aleutians.

Near to above normal temperatures are forecast across most the CONUS. The
overall transition to broad synoptic ridging favors a tilt toward above nor=
mal
temperatures, which is supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool. The GEFS
reforecast tool depicts higher probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS, likely due to its colder forecast ear=
ly
in the period as the troughing discussed in the 6-10 period moves through.
However, warmer temperatures are more likely later in the period, and given
the
positive height anomalies depicted in the GEFS for the period as a whole,
increased probabilities of above normal temperatures is the favored solutio=
n.
Increased troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly
mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the state. Some of these colder temperatures may also expand into
portions of the Pacific Northwest, where a slight tilt toward increased nea=
r
to
below normal temperature probabilities are forecast.

Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across most of the
CONUS,
given the lack of any defined mid-level features and the aforementioned bro=
ad
ridging forecast to expand across the CONUS. This is supported by both the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools. The exception is over parts of Southern Texas
where
moist, southeasterly surface flow out of the Gulf of Mexico favors enhanced
precipitation chances over a climatologically arid area for this time of ye=
ar.
As a result, probabilities of above normal precipitation are increased acro=
ss
the region. Troughing over Alaska and a series of surface lows forecast to
track in the vicinity of the state result in above normal precipitation
chances.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement in terms of the evolving mid-level pattern across North
America, offset by the temperature forecast across the central and eastern
CONUS, especially early in the period.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
359 PM EDT Mon Mar 22 2021

Valid 00Z Tue Mar 23 2021 - 00Z Thu Mar 25 2021

...Potentially heavy rain and thunderstorms are likely for the
central U.S. over the next couple of days...

...Snow and cooler than average temperatures are expected for the
Intermountain West and Rockies as a front passes through...

...Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for parts of the
Southwest through Tuesday...

A surface low pressure system is forecast to continue
strengthening tonight and move northeastward across the central
U.S. through Wednesday, spreading rain and thunderstorms along and
ahead of its associated fronts across the Plains and Mississippi
Valley. Through tonight, severe weather is possible with these
thunderstorms for portions of the Southern Plains, where the Storm
Prediction Center has delineated a Slight Risk. Locally heavy
rainfall could cause some localized flooding throughout the
Southern/Central Plains as well. On Tuesday, the Mississippi
Valley can expect widespread showers and thunderstorms, continuing
for the Lower Mississippi Valley Wednesday as a couple of fronts
stall in the region and Gulf of Mexico moisture flows in. Through
Wednesday, the Lower Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast area
should see heavy rainfall of multiple inches, which could cause
flooding/flash flooding--thus Slight Risks of excessive rainfall
are in place Tuesday and Wednesday. Strong thunderstorms could
also be a concern there. Additionally with this system, light snow
is possible on the backside of the precipitation shield for some
areas of the Northern/Central Plains, and the arrowhead of
Minnesota could receive a few inches of snow through Wednesday.
Rain may reach the East on Wednesday as that system approaches,
along with another low meandering near the Atlantic coast.

Meanwhile, a cold front is forecast to move quickly southward
across the West through Tuesday, helping cause rain and snow
behind it, along with renewed below normal temperatures and the
possibility of gusty winds. Quick-hitting snow of 6+ inches is
forecast for higher elevations, especially the Wind River
Mountains/Tetons and Bighorn Mountains tonight into Tuesday. Then
as the front slows down, snow is expected to accumulate to over a
foot across the Southern Rockies on Tuesday night into Wednesday.
Another front is forecast to come into the Northwest with
additional precipitation on Wednesday.

Conditions favorable for fire weather are expected to persist over
parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains through Tuesday,
as low relative humidities combine with gusty winds and dry fuels.
Red Flag Warnings are in place, along with Elevated to Critical
Risks of fire weather. Thus any precipitation in those areas on
Wednesday will likely be welcomed.

1213 AM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA...SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO...AND FAR WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A longwave trough will amplify southward into Arizona today while
maintaining a belt of strong (40-70kt) mid-level flow across the
southern Rockies and U.S./Mexico border.  This flow will occur atop
a very dry airmass left over in the wake of a prior system that will
eject toward the mid-Mississippi Valley area.  Lee troughing/weak
surface cyclogenesis will also organize across southern New Mexico,
fostering a favorable regime for elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions across the southern Rockies.

...Southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and far west Texas...
Vertical mixing processes and a favorable surface pressure pattern
will allow for an axis of 25-35mph westerly surface winds from
southeastern Arizona to far west Texas - strongest in Arizona.  This
flow will occur within a very dry low-level airmass, with surface
temperatures rising into the 60s/low 70s F resulting in RH values as
long as single digits in west Texas.  Ongoing drought across
portions of the region and dry fuels will support a risk of large
fires and rapid spread.  The critical delineation is focused on
areas that are expected to experience the strongest surface wind
gusts (>20 mph) amid dry conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1214 AM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will be a bit more spatially limited/focused
on D2/Wed compared to prior days.  A surface ridge will build
southward across the southern High Plains that should generally
suppress the extent of breezy/dry conditions southward toward the
TransPecos and areas of west Texas.  Meanwhile, strong flow aloft
will continue as a mid/upper wave amplifies southeastward through
northwestern Mexico.  A weak surface trough will also reside across
central Texas, helping to separate moistening surface conditions
across east Texas from much drier air over the southern Rockies.

...West Texas/southeastern New Mexico...
Along and south of the surface ridge/front, westerly flow will
continue to exceed 20 mph especially in terrain-favored areas in the
general vicinity of the TransPecos.  RH values are a bit in
question, however, as the region will likely experience areas of
cloudiness resulting from the upstream mid-level wave.  Still, RH
values should flirt with critical thresholds amidst windy surface
conditions.  Multiple days of very dry weather should also cure
fuels and support fire-spread potential.  An elevated delineation
has been added to address this threat, though expansions or even
upgrades are possible if it appears that RH values will fall below
currently expected ranges.

...Another round of heavy rain possible across parts of the Deep
South on Saturday...

...Overview...

An unsettled and active weather pattern is forecast to affect much
of the central to eastern U.S. later this week into this weekend
as a couple of shortwaves move through. Most notable may be
another round of moderate to heavy rainfall for parts of the Deep
South. Meanwhile, much of the West should trend warmer/drier as
upper ridging builds into the weekend before the next system
enters the Pacific Northwest and brings another round of rain and
mountain snows to the region.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The synoptic pattern is fairly well clustered over the CONUS
through much of the period, aside from the 18z/Mar 22 GFS which is
a big outlier with multiple systems. The better consensus brings
troughing from the West into the Central U.S. late this week,
amplifying as it moves steadily east. The latest run of the GFS
splits this energy sending a southern stream closed low into the
Southwest and then again develops a deep closed low over the
northern West Coast by next Tuesday with the next system into the
Pacific Northwest. The 12z/Mar 22 GFS run seemed closer in line
with the remaining models with the first system, so it was used in
the WPC blend in place of the 18z run. However, the 12z run was
also much faster with the next shortwave in the Pacific Northwest,
so it was excluded altogether after day 6. The ECMWF seemed the
most consistent with the ensemble means through the period, so
WPCs blend leaned mostly in that direction, with support from the
UKMET through day 5. Normal timing/detail differences arise after
day 5 so the ensemble means were given the most weight towards the
end of the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A cold front exiting the East on Friday (day 3) should drive much
of the associated precip off the coast before the medium range
period begins. Exception will to the north and west of the surface
low where a period of light snow from parts of the Great Lakes to
interior New England is possible Friday into Saturday. The
trailing frontal boundary in the Gulf of Mexico should lift
northward as a warm front focusing another round of moderate to
heavy rainfall across parts of the Deep South on Saturday. The
next system sends another cold front into the East with widespread
light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the Eastern
states on Sunday. The trend should be towards warmer and drier
weather out West this weekend, ahead of the next system into the
Pacific Northwest which should bring another round of rain and
mountain snow to the region early next week.

The eastern third of the country will start warm and above normal
through the weekend, with the greatest anomalies (+15 to +20F)
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Friday. Morning lows will
be even more so anomalously warm, with several record high minimum
temperatures possible late this week stretching from Florida to
the Northeast. Troughing entering the region early next week
should bring temperatures back down towards normal next Monday and
Tuesday. Out West, temperatures should trend warmer after this
week as upper level ridging builds across the region.

...Heavy rain and thunderstorms to drench the Central Gulf Coast
over the next couple of days...

...Mountain snow and cooler than average temperatures are expected
for the Intermountain West and Rockies...

...Critical Risk of fire weather remains in place for parts of the
Southwest today...

A strengthening low pressure system in the Central Plains this
morning is gradually tracking northeast while sporting an
impressive areal extent of precipitation that stretches from the
northern Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The central Gulf Coast
most notably features the best odds of witnessing heavy rainfall
rates and severe weather today. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall has been issued for portions of the area today along with
a Marginal Risk of severe weather. Severe storms and locally heavy
rainfall rates are also possible in the middle Mississippi Valley.
The occluded low over the Midwest Tuesday night heads into the
Great Lakes by Wednesday, sending its associated shield of rain
over the region throughout the day. Meanwhile, the storm's cold
front will lift north as a warm front over the South Central U.S.
Wednesday afternoon. This sets the stage for another round of
severe weather Wednesday evening, highlighted by a Slight Risk for
severe weather in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, another
frontal boundary near the central Gulf Coast looks to produce more
heavy rainfall embedded within strong thunderstorms. Yet another
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for roughly the
same area that was under one on Tuesday. In totals through
Wednesday night, over 5 inches of rainfall is possible from the
eastern Louisiana to southern Alabama. Flash Flood Watches remain
in effect for portions of the central Gulf Coast into the day on
Thursday.

Out West, a cold front is forecast to move quickly southward
across the West today with a broad area of rain and snow behind,
it in addition to a fresh injection of below normal temperatures
and gusty winds. Quick-hitting snow of 6+ inches is forecast for
higher elevations, especially the Wind River Mountains/Tetons and
Bighorn Mountains tonight into Tuesday. The front will slow down
over the Southwest Tuesday night ahead of an amplifying upper
trough over the Four Corners region. This upper trough then
triggers periods of mountain snow over the southern Rockies with
totals ranging from 1 to 2 feet in the highest elevations of
northern New Mexico. Another front is forecast to come into the
Northwest with additional precipitation on Wednesday. The upper
trough quickly weakens Wednesday evening, closing the door on
additional snowfall in the southern Rockies but it does help to
produce scattered showers in parts of the southern Plains.

Elsewhere, conditions favorable for fire weather are expected to
persist over parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains today
due to low relative humidities combined with gusty winds and dry
fuels. Red Flag Warnings are in place, along with Elevated to
Critical Risks of fire weather. Some welcomed precipitation is
anticipated over the next couple days. The Northwest will see yet
another round of precipitation as a cold front swings through the
region Wednesday evening where several inches of mountain snow is
possible throughout the region. Lastly, high pressure supplying
one more day of dry and mild conditions throughout the Northeast
gives way to an approaching frontal system off the East Coast on
Wednesday, delivering periods of rain to the region on Wednesday.

...Heavy rain and thunderstorms to drench the Central Gulf Coast
over the next couple of days...

...Mountain snow and cooler than average temperatures are expected
for the Intermountain West and Rockies...

...Critical Risk of fire weather remains in place for parts of the
Southwest today...

A strengthening low pressure system in the Central Plains this
morning is gradually tracking northeast while sporting an
impressive areal extent of precipitation that stretches from the
northern Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The central Gulf Coast
most notably features the best odds of witnessing heavy rainfall
rates and severe weather today. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall has been issued for portions of the area today along with
a Marginal Risk of severe weather. Severe storms and locally heavy
rainfall rates are also possible in the middle Mississippi Valley.
The occluded low over the Midwest Tuesday night heads into the
Great Lakes by Wednesday, sending its associated shield of rain
over the region throughout the day. Meanwhile, the storm's cold
front will lift north as a warm front over the South Central U.S.
Wednesday afternoon. This sets the stage for another round of
severe weather Wednesday evening, highlighted by a Slight Risk for
severe weather in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile, another
frontal boundary near the central Gulf Coast looks to produce more
heavy rainfall embedded within strong thunderstorms. Yet another
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for roughly the
same area that was under one on Tuesday. In total through
Wednesday night, over 5 inches of rainfall is possible from the
eastern Louisiana to southern Alabama. Flash Flood Watches remain
in effect for portions of the central Gulf Coast into the day on
Thursday.

Out West, a cold front is forecast to move quickly southward
across the West today with a broad area of rain and snow behind,
it in addition to a fresh injection of below normal temperatures
and gusty winds. Quick-hitting snow of 6+ inches is forecast for
higher elevations, especially the Wind River Mountains/Tetons and
Bighorn Mountains tonight into Tuesday. The front will slow down
over the Southwest Tuesday night ahead of an amplifying upper
trough over the Four Corners region. This upper trough then
triggers periods of mountain snow over the southern Rockies with
totals ranging from 1 to 2 feet in the highest elevations of
northern New Mexico. Another front is forecast to come into the
Northwest with additional precipitation on Wednesday. The upper
trough quickly weakens Wednesday evening, closing the door on
additional snowfall in the southern Rockies but it does help to
produce scattered showers in parts of the southern Plains.

Elsewhere, conditions favorable for fire weather are expected to
persist over parts of the Southwest and southern High Plains today
due to low relative humidities combined with gusty winds and dry
fuels. Red Flag Warnings are in place, along with Elevated to
Critical Risks of fire weather. Some welcomed precipitation is
anticipated over the next couple days. The Northwest will see yet
another round of precipitation as a cold front swings through the
region Wednesday evening where several inches of mountain snow is

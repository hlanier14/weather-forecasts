portions of the upper Midwest by late tonight. Meanwhile, in the
wake of the trough, a surface ridge is forecast to build over the
Great Basin, resulting in the onset of offshore flow across portions
of southern California.

...Southeast NM/West TX...
Dry and breezy post-frontal conditions are expected across parts of
the southeast NM and west TX this afternoon. Sustained winds of
15-25 mph (with higher gusts) and minimum RH values below 20% are
expected, resulting in the potential for elevated to locally
critical fire-weather conditions in areas where receptive fuels are
available.

...Eastern CO...
Post-frontal downslope flow will result in relatively dry and breezy
conditions across parts of eastern CO this afternoon. Sustained
winds of 15-20 mph (with higher gusts) are possible, concurrent with
minimum RH values as low as 15-20%, resulting in a threat of
elevated fire-weather conditions.

...Southern CA...
Elevated wind/RH conditions may develop late tonight across
terrain-favored portions of Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties,
within a developing offshore flow regime. However, with limited
coverage/duration of elevated conditions through the end of the
period and a lack of initially receptive fuels (based on latest fuel
guidance), no highlights have been included.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
Sunday-Monday...

...Lake Effect/enhanced precipitation this weekend through early
next week across the Great Lakes...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance is in general agreement with the progression
of an initial amplified trough in the East this weekend and a
reinforcing shortwave behind that into the Midwest/East
Sunday-Monday. By Tuesday/day 6, the 06z GFS becomes fast with the
shortwave as it exits the Northeast, while the better clustering
of the ensemble means/ECMWF/CMC supports something a little
slower. The next system into the East Pac/Western U.S. comes by
early next week, with the 06z GFS lagging significantly behind the
ECMWF/CMC (and ensemble means) and noticeably flatter with the
wave as it crosses the West next Tues/Wed.

The WPC medium range suite used a general blend of the
deterministic models (slightly more weighting towards the
ECMWF/CMC over the GFS/UKMET) days 3-4. After this, the GFS (and
UKMET which phased out after day 5) was replaced with the ensemble
means to help mitigate the differences which begin to arise
mid-late period. Maintained more emphasis on the ECMWF through the
entire period though which was the deterministic solution closest
to that of the ensemble means, both in the East and the West.


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...
An amplified trough will pass slowly through the eastern CONUS,
periodically reinforced by shortwaves rounding its southwest side.
Its associated cold fronts sweep across the East this weekend with
mainly light and scattered showers. South to southwest flow on the
backside of the mean trough should help support enhanced lake
effect precipitation/snows from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
into the northern Appalachians/Northeast. Temperatures should be
generally around 10F below average for portions of the East
Saturday through Tuesday. Moderation in the East is expected on
Wednesday as low pressure moves across central Canada, with its
cold front moving into the Upper Midwest, and the surface ridge
axis slides towards the Southeast coast.

For the Pacific Northwest, a cold front with a long fetch of
Pacific moisture directed onshore, will drop slowly south along
the Pacific northwest Coast Sunday-Monday resulting in moderate to
heavy rainfall in the valleys and snow in the highest peaks.
Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and elevation
snows mainly over the Olympics and Cascades, though some spill
over precipitation is possible across parts of the northern
Rockies next Tuesday into Wednesday. Until the Western trough
moves into the area next Tuesday and Wednesday, temperatures are
expected to be 10-15F above average before nudging slightly below
average in the Northern Continental Divide on Wednesday.

FUNdaRTGOaE$

FOR THURSDAY NOVEMBER 18 - WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 24: The highest forecast
confidence in the week-2 hazards outlook exists across Mainland Alaska wher=
e
anomalous cold is likely due to a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge centered
upstream over the Bering Strait and surface high pressure to the north of t=
he
state. The GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means are in excellent agreeme=
nt
with this large-scale pattern. A slight risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
is posted for areas of Mainland Alaska where according to the GEFS reforeca=
st
tool, there is near or more than a 20 percent chance of minimum temperature=
s
falling into the lowest 15th percentile. Based on this reforecast tool, the=
re
is a 20 to 60 percent chance of minimum temperatures falling below -20 degr=
ees
F across central and eastern interior Alaska. Since this amplified ridge
upstream is expected to remain fairly stable with time, the slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures continues through the entirety of week-2. Meanwhi=
le,
onshore flow is expected to bring periods of snow, potentially heavy at tim=
es,
to the Alaska Panhandle throughout week-2.



The ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means remain in good agreement that a 500-h=
Pa
trough progresses eastward across the higher latitudes of the central and
eastern U.S. at the beginning of week-2. Based on this good model agreement
and
continuity, a cold front is expected to usher in at least a brief period of
below normal temperatures to the north-central U.S. through Nov 19 or 20.
Since
this is most likely to be a transient period of anomalous cold of a couple =
of
days, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is not posted today.
Also, the largest negative temperature anomalies during mid to late Novembe=
r
are expected to remain across Canada. Behind a cold front, gusty northwest
winds support a slight risk of high winds (Nov 18) for the north-central U.=
S.
Based on the deterministic 0Z ECMWF model and its ensemble mean, predicted
surface flow and strong cold air advection favor a slight risk of heavy sno=
w
downwind of Lakes Michigan and Superior on Nov 18 and 19. The high amplitud=
e
ridge near the Bering Strait would favor additional outbreaks of anomalous
cold
into the north-central U.S. The evolving pattern will have to be closely
monitored during the next two weeks as Arctic air is likely to build up at =
the
highest latitudes of western North America.



The timing of when enhanced onshore flow and associated precipitation and w=
ind
hazards returns to the Pacific Northwest remains highly uncertain. The GFS
ensemble mean develops an amplified trough over the Northeast Pacific durin=
g
week-2 which would likely lead to a return of enhanced onshore flow as earl=
y
as
day 11 (Nov 21), but the Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means persist a mean
500-hPa ridge through late week-2.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1236 AM CST Wed Nov 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
Little change to the large-scale pattern is expected on Thursday,
with a deep mid/upper-level trough covering much of the Plains and
upper Midwest, while an upper ridge is maintained over the West. A
surface ridge will persist over the Great Basin, maintaining an
offshore flow regime across southern California.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow will result in potentially elevated wind/RH conditions
across portions of southern CA Thursday, especially across
terrain-favored areas. However, the extent and duration of elevated
conditions remains somewhat uncertain, with a tendency for the
strongest winds to occur overnight and during the morning, while RH
reductions supporting an elevated threat may be limited to the
afternoon and early evening. Another potential limiting factor will
be initially unfavorable fuels (per recent fuel guidance). While
some curing of fuels is expected with time, uncertainty regarding
the magnitude of the fire-weather threat remains too high to include
an Elevated area at this time.

...Persistent heavy rain and higher elevation snow continue with
series of Pacific storms impacting the Northwest...

...Storm system bringing rain, thunderstorms, and wintry precip to
the eastern half of the country...

A series of Pacific storm systems will impact the Northwest
through the forecast period. An atmospheric river will help
encourage waves of high moisture into the region leading to
widespread heavy rain. A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall
remains in place for northwestern Oregon through Wednesday morning
with rain rates as high as 0.75 inches possible. A second surge of
moisture will impact the area Thursday with a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall issued for the Cascades of Washington west to
the coast and south into far northwestern Oregon. Rainfall totals
of 2-4 + inches are possible, especially where orographic
enhancements along the mountains will promote heavier rainfall. A
Marginal Risk remains in place for the same areas on Friday as the
heavy rain chances continue, with another 1-2 + inches forecast.
In all cases, the greatest concern for flooding will be along any
burn scar areas. Snow chances should remain isolated to higher
mountain peaks with generally warmer air in place leading to high
snow levels. Some scattered rain and snow showers are also likely
for the Northern and Central Rockies through the period out ahead
of each system.

An active weather pattern is currently in place across the central
U.S. As an upper-level trough exists the Rockies and moves over
the Plains, a surface low pressure system over the Central Plains
will strengthen and continue to the northeast throughout the
forecast period, bringing widespread rain, thunderstorms, and
wintry precip to most of the eastern half of the country.  A cold
front will move across the Midwest and Southern Plains Thursday
evening east to the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Southeast on
Thursday and reaching the East Coast on Friday. Widespread rain
and thunderstorms are likely ahead of the cold front. Severe
weather is possible through this evening for portions of
northeastern Kansas, central/eastern Oklahoma, and northern Texas.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe
weather with for the threat of large hail, gusty winds, and an
isolated tornado or two. Otherwise, any thunderstorms are expected
to not reach severe levels through the rest of the period. As
colder air is funneled southward on the back side of the system, a
wintry mix of rain and snow will overspread the Northern Plains
Thursday and Upper Midwest Friday. The chance of accumulating snow
has been increasing in more recent model guidance and totals of
2-4 inches, locally higher, appear possible.

A shortwave rounding the the upper-level trough will help
encourage a second surge of colder, Canadian air southward through
the Midwest and Plains Thursday night into Friday. Many areas
across the Northern Plains, Mid- to Upper Missouri Valley, and
Upper Midwest will see highs in the 30s on Friday, while the Ohio
Valley to Central Plains will be in the 40s and 50s. Meanwhile,
temperatures will be warm and above normal ahead of the front,
with 70s for the Gulf Coast and 50s for New England warming to the
low 70s for the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic.

Generally tranquil and dry conditions are expected across the
Southwest, southern Great Basin, and California. Above normal high
temperatures are forecast with 60s for the Great Basin and 70s and
80s for the Southwest and California, with low 90s possible for
the desert portions of the Southwest on Friday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 16 - 20 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions depict a variable 500-hPa=
 flow pattern across most
of
the forecast domain during the 6 to 10 day period. The period begins with
troughing over the northwestern CONUS and a ridge over the Mississippi Vall=
ey.
These features quickly progress eastward during the period in the ECMWF mod=
el
solutions but the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means depict more persistent
troughing across parts of the western CONUS. . Agreement is relatively bett=
er
across Alaska as an upstream ridge over Eastern Siberia will likely promote
troughing and anomalous northerly mid-level flow across most of the Mainlan=
d
Alaska. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primarily on the ensemble me=
ans
from the 06z GEFS and 00z ECMWF, generally feature weak height anomalies
across
the CONUS, consistent with the expected variable pattern. Above normal heig=
hts
are favored for western Alaska and the Panhandle with near to below normal
heights forecast across eastern Mainland Alaska.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow forecast downstream of the eastern Siber=
ia
ridge and near surface easterly flow from western Canada lead to increased
odds
of below normal temperatures across Alaska. Surface high pressures predicte=
d
over northwestern Canada and the western CONUS will likely lead to a trend
toward colder temperatures for parts of the Pacific Northwest. Near normal
temperatures are favored for the rest of the northwestern and north-central
CONUS as warmth predicted early in the period may potentially be offset by =
a
colder pattern late. Forecast southeasterly low-level flow leads to enhance=
d
probabilities of above normal temperatures across the remainder of the West=
.
Conversely, the northerly low-level flow on the east side of a forecast
surface
high pressure over the eastern CONUS tilts the odds toward below normal
temperatures across parts of the Eastern Seaboard.

Anomalous northerly mid-level flow and offshore low-level flow are expected=
 to
combine to favor a dry pattern for most of Alaska.  Farther to the south, m=
ean
onshore flow is expected, favoring an active pattern with elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation across the northwestern CONUS.
Mean surface high pressure is forecast across much of the remainder of the
CONUS, favoring below normal precipitation. However, as surface high pressu=
re
progresses eastward across the Southeast, return moisture flow is possible
across parts of the western Gulf and Mississippi Valley.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
variable pattern predicted across most of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 18 - 24 2021

During the week-2 period, a low-amplitude mean 500-hPa pattern is forecast
across the CONUS due to the continued variable pattern forecast and resulta=
nt
high model uncertainty. Models are in better agreement over Alaska, as stro=
ng
ridging forecast over eastern Siberia is expected to persist, leading to me=
an
troughing downstream across most of the state. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height
blend is based on the 06z GEFS, the 00z ECMWF ensemble mean. The resultant
pattern features cyclonic flow across most of the CONUS and Alaska.

Surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska, fav=
ors
increased easterly low-level flow and enhanced below-normal temperature
probabilities across Alaska. Potential increased troughing, particularly in
the
GEFS solutions, leads to slightly increased odds of below normal temperatur=
es
for parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley. Near to above normal temperature=
s
are favored for much of the western CONUS, the south-central CONUS, and mos=
t
of
the Eastern Seaboard.

Mean surface high pressure over northwestern Canada and northeastern Alaska
increases chances of below-normal precipitation across much of Alaska.
However,
a positively tilted trough is forecast to dig across the Mainland, leading =
to
a
potential for an increasingly active pattern downstream across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, with associated elevated
chances of above normal precipitation. Likewise, predicted enhanced Pacific
Flow increases odds for above-normal precipitation across the northwestern
CONUS. Elevated probabilities of above-normal precipitation are also favore=
d
across the Southern Plains, much of the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, and
parts
of the Great Lakes Region and East Coast, associated with potential return
moisture flow behind departing surface high pressure forecast over the
Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a variable pattern predicted across most of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...Persistent heavy rain and higher elevation snow continue with
series of Pacific storms impacting the Northwest...

...Storm system bringing rain, thunderstorms, and a wintry mix to
the eastern half of the country...

A series of Pacific storm systems will impact the Northwest
through the forecast period. An atmospheric river will help
encourage waves of high moisture into the region leading to
widespread heavy rain. A Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall
remains in place for northwestern Oregon through Thursday morning
with rain rates as high as 0.75 inches possible. A second surge of
moisture will impact the area during the day Thursday with a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall issued for the Cascades of
Washington west to the coast and south into far northwestern
Oregon. Rainfall totals of 2-4 + inches are possible, especially
where orographic enhancements along the mountains will promote
heavier rainfall. A Marginal Risk remains in place for the most of
the same areas on Friday as the heavy rain chances continue, with
another 1-2 + inches forecast. In all cases, the greatest concern
for flooding will be along any burn scars. Snow chances should
remain isolated to higher mountain peaks as generally warmer air
in place will keep snow levels high. Some scattered rain and snow
showers are also likely for the Northern and Central Rockies ahead
of each system through the period.

An active weather pattern is currently in place across the central
U.S. As an upper-level trough exists the Rockies and moves over
the Plains, a surface low pressure system over the Central Plains
will strengthen and continue to the northeast through the forecast
period, bringing widespread rain, thunderstorms, and a wintry mix
to most of the eastern half of the country. A cold front will move
across the Midwest and Southern Plains Wednesday evening east to
the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Southeast on Thursday, finally
reaching the East Coast on Friday. Widespread rain and
thunderstorms are likely ahead of the cold front. Severe weather
is possible through this evening for portions of northeastern
Kansas, central/eastern Oklahoma, and northern Texas. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather for
the threat of large hail, gusty winds, and an isolated tornado or
two. Otherwise, any thunderstorms are not expected to reach severe
levels through the rest of the period. As colder air is funneled
southward on the back side of the system, a wintry mix of rain and
snow will overspread the Northern Plains Thursday and Upper
Midwest Friday. The chance of accumulating snow has been
increasing in more recent model guidance and totals of 2-4 inches,
locally higher, appear possible.

A shortwave rounding the the upper-level trough will help
encourage a second surge of colder, Canadian air southward through
the Midwest and Plains Thursday night into Friday. Many areas
across the Northern Plains, Mid- to Upper Missouri Valley, and
Upper Midwest will see highs in the 30s on Friday, while the Ohio
Valley to Central Plains will be in the 40s and 50s. Meanwhile,
temperatures will be warm and above normal ahead of the cold
front, with 50s for New England warming into to the low 70s for
the southern Mid-Atlantic, Southeast, and Gulf Coast.

Generally tranquil and dry conditions are expected across the
Southwest, southern Great Basin, and California. Above normal high
temperatures are forecast with 60s for the Great Basin and 70s and
80s for the Southwest and California. Some highs in the low 90s
are possible for desert portions of the Southwest on Friday.

...Moderate to heavy precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
Sunday-Monday...

...Lake Effect/enhanced precipitation this weekend through early
next week across the Great Lakes...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance is in general agreement with the progression
of an initial amplified trough in the East this weekend and a
reinforcing shortwave behind that into the Midwest/East
Sunday-Monday. By Tuesday/day 6, the 06z GFS becomes fast with the
shortwave as it exits the Northeast, while the better clustering
of the ensemble means/ECMWF/CMC supports something a little
slower. The next system into the East Pac/Western U.S. comes by
early next week, with the 06z GFS lagging significantly behind the
ECMWF/CMC (and ensemble means) and noticeably flatter with the
wave as it crosses the West next Tues/Wed.

The WPC medium range suite used a general blend of the
deterministic models (slightly more weighting towards the
ECMWF/CMC over the GFS/UKMET) days 3-4. After this, the GFS (and
UKMET which phased out after day 5) was replaced with the ensemble
means to help mitigate the differences which begin to arise
mid-late period. Maintained more emphasis on the ECMWF through the
entire period though which was the deterministic solution closest
to that of the ensemble means, both in the East and the West.


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...
An amplified trough will pass slowly through the eastern CONUS,
periodically reinforced by shortwaves rounding its southwest side.
Its associated cold fronts sweep across the East this weekend with
mainly light and scattered showers. South to southwest flow on the
backside of the mean trough should help support enhanced lake
effect precipitation/snows from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
into the northern Appalachians/Northeast. Temperatures should be
generally around 10F below average for portions of the East
Saturday through Tuesday. Moderation in the East is expected on
Wednesday as low pressure moves across central Canada, with its
cold front moving into the Upper Midwest, and the surface ridge
axis slides towards the Southeast coast.

For the Pacific Northwest, a cold front with a long fetch of
Pacific moisture directed onshore, will drop slowly south along
the Pacific northwest Coast Sunday-Monday resulting in moderate to
heavy rainfall in the valleys and snow in the highest peaks.
Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and elevation
snows mainly over the Olympics and Cascades, though some spill
over precipitation is possible across parts of the northern
Rockies next Tuesday into Wednesday. Until the Western trough
moves into the area next Tuesday and Wednesday, temperatures are
expected to be 10-15F above average before nudging slightly below
average in the Northern Continental Divide on Wednesday.

The latest guidance is in general agreement with the progression
of an initial amplified trough in the East this weekend and a

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...
An amplified trough will pass slowly through the eastern CONUS,
periodically reinforced by shortwaves rounding its southwest side.
Its associated cold fronts sweep across the East this weekend with
mainly light and scattered showers. South to southwest flow on the
backside of the mean trough should help support enhanced lake
effect precipitation/snows from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
into the northern Appalachians/Northeast. Temperatures should be
generally around 10F below average for portions of the East
Saturday through Tuesday. Moderation in the East is expected on
Wednesday as low pressure moves across central Canada, with its
cold front moving into the Upper Midwest, and the surface ridge
axis slides towards the Southeast coast.

For the Pacific Northwest, a cold front with a long fetch of
Pacific moisture directed onshore, will drop slowly south along
the Pacific northwest Coast Sunday-Monday resulting in moderate to
heavy rainfall in the valleys and snow in the highest peaks.
Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and elevation
snows mainly over the Olympics and Cascades, though some spill
over precipitation is possible across parts of the northern

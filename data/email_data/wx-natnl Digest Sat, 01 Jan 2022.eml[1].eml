Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes have been made to the ongoing forecast.

Today, a surface cold front continues to move slowly south across
the central United States. This front will be slow to clear
southeast Colorado, where west-southwest surface winds to the south
of a developing low will slow or stall the front's southward
advancement. Within this belt of west-southwest surface flow, peak
afternoon winds of 15-20 mph will be possible, and minimum relative
humidity percentages will be around 20. Locally elevated conditions
will be possible. However, the short window of solar insolation and
increasing high-level clouds should limit the overlap of
fire-effective conditions to brief/localized areas despite extremely
dry background conditions.

Additional meteorological discussion is provided below.

..Marsh.. 12/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a strong trough will consolidate across the Four
Corners and southern Rockies through the day as a shortwave within
the subtropical stream merges with the advancing pacific wave. As
the trough ejects eastward, a lee low will develop supporting
widespread precipitation across the central US. Following the low, a
powerful arctic front will move south through the Plains ushering in
a frigid air mass and changing the northern half of the ongoing
precipitation to a wintry mix. Given the expected precipitation,
fire weather concerns are expected to decrease. The only exception
may be across far southeastern Colorado where downslope winds ahead
of the front may support locally elevated fire weather conditions
for a few hours. However, uncertainty remains large and no areas
will be included at this time.

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 03 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 07 2022

...Multi-day coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow
threat for the Pacific Northwest and northern California to the
northern Great Basin/Rockies next week...
...Arctic blast to focus over the north-central U.S.
Tuesday-Friday with snow likely for the chilled Great Lakes states
through the interior Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3/4 (Monday-Tuesday) along with the 13
UTC NBM in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
Model differences near the surface become increasingly problematic
Wednesday-Friday despite a generally compatible larger scale
pattern evolution aloft. This is not unusual during the cold
season in periods with stark baroclinic zones and phasing
uncertainties. The WPC medium range product suite in this period
was accordingly derived from a composite of better clustered
guidance from the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC NAEFS mean that have
a cooler Arctic airmass over time than the 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble
mean. Some added input from the best system compatible 00 UTC
ECMWF and additional manual adjustments added some detail
consistent with the upper flow, pattern recognition and continuity.

...Weather Pattern and Weather/Hazards Highlights..

A cold Canadian surface high will settle far south across much of
the central/eastern U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front to
exit the East Coast by Monday whose coastal low lifts offshore the
Mid-Atlantic. Surface cyclogenesis ensues over the north-central
U.S. Tuesday/Wednesday in response to an amplifying upper trough,
with yet another surge of frigid air in it's wake.  Trailing
frontal low genesis offers some moderate trailing frontal focusing
rain potential along with a heavy snow threat spreading mainly
from the Great Lake states to interior New England next
Thursday/Friday with windy/wrapped flow and cold air over the
lakes enhancement.

Protracted periods of heavy coastal rains and heavy mountain
focusing snows will develop from the Northwest and northern
California into the northern Great Basin through early to later
next week as energies from a multi-day Pacific storm system press
inland. Unlike recent events, latest guidance trends suggest this
storm episode is not expected to produce heavy precipitation for
central/southern California. A multi-day heavy snow threat is also
likely for the north-central Rockies/High Plains as further
enhanced by a favorable post-frontal upslope Arctic airmass fetch
with temperatures as cold as 20-40 degrees below normal over the
northern Plains along with dangerous wind chills.

...Multi-day coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow
threat for the Pacific Northwest and northern California to the
northern Great Basin/Rockies next week...
...Arctic blast to focus over the north-central U.S.
Tuesday-Friday with snow likely for the chilled Great Lakes states
through the interior Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3/4 (Monday-Tuesday) along with the 13
UTC NBM in a pattern with overall above normal predictability.
Model differences near the surface become increasingly problematic
Wednesday-Friday despite a generally compatible larger scale
pattern evolution aloft. This is not unusual during the cold
season in periods with stark baroclinic zones and phasing
uncertainties. The WPC medium range product suite in this period
was accordingly derived from a composite of better clustered
guidance from the 06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC NAEFS mean that have
a cooler Arctic airmass over time than the 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble
mean. Some added input from the best system compatible 00 UTC
ECMWF and additional manual adjustments added some detail
consistent with the upper flow, pattern recognition and continuity.

...Weather Pattern and Weather/Hazards Highlights..

A cold Canadian surface high will settle far south across much of
the central/eastern U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front to
exit the East Coast by Monday whose coastal low lifts offshore the
Mid-Atlantic. Surface cyclogenesis ensues over the north-central
U.S. Tuesday/Wednesday in response to an amplifying upper trough,
with yet another surge of frigid air in it's wake.  Trailing
frontal low genesis offers some moderate trailing frontal focusing
rain potential along with a heavy snow threat spreading mainly
from the Great Lake states to interior New England next
Thursday/Friday with windy/wrapped flow and cold air over the
lakes enhancement.

Protracted periods of heavy coastal rains and heavy mountain
focusing snows will develop from the Northwest and northern
California into the northern Great Basin through early to later
next week as energies from a multi-day Pacific storm system press
inland. Unlike recent events, latest guidance trends suggest this
storm episode is not expected to produce heavy precipitation for
central/southern California. A multi-day heavy snow threat is also
likely for the north-central Rockies/High Plains as further
enhanced by a favorable post-frontal upslope Arctic airmass fetch
with temperatures as cold as 20-40 degrees below normal over the
northern Plains along with dangerous wind chills.

300 PM EST December 31 2021

SYNOPSIS: A pattern change is becoming more likely by the second week of
January 2022. The persistent and strong area of mid-level low pressure over
western North America is expected to be replaced by mid-level high pressure=
.
This transition would favor a warming trend and a much drier pattern
throughout
the West. It should be noted that during the latter half of January, mid-le=
vel
low pressure is expected to return to the western U.S. A series of cold fro=
nts
are forecast to usher in at least brief periods of anomalous cold to the
east-central U.S. from January 8 to 11. A rapid moderation in temperatures =
is
anticipated for southeastern Alaska by the second week of January with at
least
a brief period of above-normal precipitation.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for the upper Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, and northern New England, Sat-Tue, Jan 8-11.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Midwest and parts of =
the
Northeast, Sat-Wed, Jan 8-12.

Slight risk of high winds for southern California, Mon-Fri, Jan 10-14.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Alaska Panhandle,
Sat-Sun, Jan 8-9.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain, freezing rain, and snow) for part=

FOR SATURDAY JANUARY 08 - FRIDAY JANUARY 14: Following strong mid-level hig=
h
(low) pressure over the North Pacific (western North America) persisting
through December, ensemble means are in good agreement that a 500-hPa ridge
becomes established across the western U.S. from Jan 8 to 10. Consistent wi=
th
this major longwave pattern change, the GFS ensemble members depict the
strongly negative Pacific North American (PNA) becoming neutral or even
positive by week-2. This developing ridge aloft is likely to result in a mu=
ch
drier pattern across the western third of the CONUS compared to December wh=
en
precipitation averaged more than 150 percent of normal throughout much of
California and Nevada. Although high-elevation snow may linger across the
northern Rockies through Jan 8, the predicted longwave pattern and
precipitation tools support discontinuing all precipitation hazards across =
the
West. Below-normal precipitation is favored from the West Coast east to the
Rockies and high Plains from Jan 8 to 14.



A building 500-hPa ridge near the West Coast is expected to promote surface
high pressure becoming centered over the Great Basin later in week-2. This
evolving pattern aloft and at the surface increases the chances of a Santa =
Ana
wind event. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is posted for southern
California during week-2. The very wet late December across this region is
likely to mitigate the wildfire risk with the predicted offshore winds. Due=
 to
uncertainty on when surface high pressure becomes centered over the Great
Basin, the slight risk of high winds goes from Jan 10 to 14.



Model guidance remains in good agreement that a cold front results in a
continued outbreak of anomalous cold across the north-central U.S. prior to
week-2. This anomalous cold is expected to shift east to the Northeast duri=
ng
the second weekend of January 2022 but likely not extend too far south of t=
he
40th parallel across east-central U.S. Another surge of anomalous cold may
follow thereafter from Jan 9 to 11. Based on better recent skill of the ECM=
WF
reforecast tool, this model solution is preferred today in depicting the mu=
ch
below normal temperature hazard in its spatial extent and temporal scale. A
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures (Jan 8-11) is posted across
the
upper Mississippi Valley, parts of the Great Lakes, and northern New Englan=
d
where minimum temperatures have more than a 40 percent chance of falling be=
low
the 15th percentile of the climatological distribution. Minimum temperature=
s
of
around -20 degrees F are expected in northern Minnesota early in week-2, wh=
ile
subzero temperatures may extend as far south as northeast Iowa and northern
Illinois. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures continues through
Jan
12, but models are trending towards a quick moderation in temperatures acro=
ss
the Midwest by around this date.



Much below normal temperatures are likely to persist across southeastern
Alaska
during the first week of January 2022. As a 500-hPa trough develops upstrea=
m
to
the south of the Aleutians and enhanced onshore flow begins, a rapid warmin=
g
trend is forecast for the Alaska Panhandle. A slight risk of much below nor=
mal
temperatures is maintained for this region on Jan 8 and 9 for continuity
purposes from previous outlooks, but a quick end to the anomalous cold is
becoming more likely by the second week of January. Based on the predicted
enhanced onshore flow and output from the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, =
a
slight risk of heavy precipitation (20 percent chance of 3-day amounts
exceeding the 85th percentile) is posted for the Prince William Sound to th=
e
Alaska Panhandle from Jan 8 to 12. Given the antecedent cold temperatures w=
ell
established before this onset of onshore flow, there is an increased risk o=
f
heavy snow and freezing rain especially on Jan 8 and 9. This predicted wet
period may be brief as week 3-4 tools are depicting the return of a -PNA la=
ter
in the month.

0155 PM CST Fri Dec 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

Elevated to locally critical meteorological fire conditions look to
develop across portions of Texas in the vicinity of the Big Bend.
Here, gusty winds, locally in excess of 20 mph, will develop
coincident with minimum relative humidity percentages in the teens.
Thus, an elevated area was added with this forecast cycle. However,
fuel moisture may temper overall fire concerns as ERC values are
generally below 80 percent.

See below for additional meteorological discussion.

..Marsh.. 12/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Fri Dec 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep and progressive trough is forecast to move across the
south-central CONUS through the forecast period on Day2/Sat. Strong
flow aloft along the back of the trough will overspread portions of
the southern Plains and southwest Texas ahead of a fast moving
surface low and Arctic front. Widespread precipitation, (some
wintry) is expected to be ongoing across the central and southern
Plains through much of the period. While dry and windy conditions
appear possible ahead of the front, considerable uncertainty exists
regarding available fuels and the resulting risk for sustained fire
weather conditions.

...Southwest Texas...
Strong/gusty westerly surface winds are forecast across portions of
southwest Texas ahead of the cold front with gusts of 20-30 mph
possible through the day. Uncertainty remains high regarding surface
conditions given widespread precipitation and cooler temperatures
associated with the advancing cold front. Hi-res ensemble guidance
suggests only localized pockets of near-critical humidity are
possible. In addition, fuel availability is questionable given the
potential for precipitation casting further doubt on any sustained
fire weather threat. Nonetheless, some potential for locally
elevated fire weather conditions will be possible given the strength
of the low-level wind field and locally receptive fuels.

...Temperatures will be 20 to 35 degrees below average for the
Northern Intermountain Region and over the Plains, while
temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from the
Western Gulf Coast to the Mid-Atlantic...

An area of cold high pressure over Northern High Plains will
slowly move southward over the Southern Plains and into the
Central Rockies.  Temperatures associated with the high are 20 to
35 degrees below average for the Northern Intermountain Region and
over the Plains.  There is a front from the Great Lakes to the
Central Plains to the Northwest along the leading edge of the cold
air.  On the southern side of the front, temperatures will be 15
to 25 degrees above average from the Western Gulf Coast to the
Mid-Atlantic.  Moisture will pool along the boundary over the
eastern two-thirds of the country.  Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of the front from the Ohio Valley to the
Southern Plains.  Due to the dynamics of the severe thunderstorms,
the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys,
and Southern Plains through Saturday morning.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Furthermore, heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over parts of the
Ohio, Tennessee, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys, and Southern
Plains through Saturday morning.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday
morning.

More hazards lay on the north side of the front as heavy snow will
develop over the Central Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley
overnight Friday into Saturday.  In addition, there will be areas
of rain/freezing rain along the rain/snow line from parts of the
Southern Plains to Middle Mississippi Valley overnight Friday, too.

The hazards continue on New Year s Day as showers and
thunderstorms continue along and ahead of the front.  However, the
threat of severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall increases.
Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower
Mississippi Valleys from Saturday into Sunday morning.  The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  However, there is a 10% or greater probability of
EF2-EF5 over parts of the Tennessee and Lower Mississippi Valley
into parts of the Southeast.

Likewise, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower Mississippi Valleys from Saturday into Sunday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding.  Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through day morning.  The winter weather
threat will continue as moderate to heavy snow develops from the
Great Lakes into Northern New England on New Year s Day.  Also,
there will be isolated pockets of rain/freezing rain along the
rain/snow line.

Meanwhile, snow will develop over parts of the Southwest and
Southern/Central Rockies through Saturday evening.  Furthermore,
there will also be rain and showers with embedded thunderstorms
from parts of the Southwest to Texas.  The rain and snow will
generally end by Saturday evening.  A front will begin to come
onshore over the Pacific Northwest on Sunday.  Rain and higher
elevation snow will develop over parts of the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday afternoon into evening.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook

300 PM EST Fri Dec 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JANUARY 2022

The updated temperature and precipitation outlooks for January 2022 reflect
potential impacts associated with a predicted change in the PNA and lagged
impacts from an active phase 8 (Western Pacific) MJO. Those two are typical=
ly
associated with bouts of lower heights/cooler temperatures over much of the
contiguous 48 states. Additionally, the precipitation signal associated wit=
h a
positive PNA is counter to the seasonal signal from the on going La Nina. T=
he
MJO signal would be transient, almost by definition, while the sign of the =
PNA
is likely to be less negative or even positive during Week-2. Many model
predictions then shift the PNA back to negative through the later half of J=
an
2022, resulting in a highly variable pattern. The flips in those patterns
results in some increased uncertainty/lower probabilities.



The temperature outlook for Jan now indicates a broad area of below normal
temperatures favored from the Pacific Northwest to the Great Lakes, and a
small
portion of New England. This represents a 2-class change, from the mid-
December
release, for portions of New England and a much cooler outlook for the Ohio
Valley and mid-Atlantic, though uncertainty there is probably the highest i=
n
the domain for the temperature outlook. Above normal temperatures remain mo=
st
likely from the Southwest to the Gulf Coast and Florida.  he odds for below
normal temperatures were increased across much of Alaska, with the highest
odds
being across southeastern mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.  There
will
be periods of variability there, but in balance, tools point toward colder
than
normal with a mean ridge to the west for the second half of the month.



The precipitation outlook reflects some of the more certain information in =
the
first week. Some areas of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys are
likely to receive precipitation totaling more than the lower limit for belo=
w
normal precipitation, so the region where above normal precipitation is
favored
has expanded as far south as Arkansas. The early month precipitation, as we=
ll
as some predicted later uncertainty reduced the coverage of below normal
precipitation for the Southeast, in contrast to the seasonal signal typical=
ly
imparted by La Nina. Additionally, portions of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies are also forecast to receive continued high amounts, thoug=
h
that is likely to flip during Week-2, but a negative PNA is predicted for t=
he
second half of the month, ushering in a second potential wet period. The
northern Plains are an area of uncertainty with short-term dryness, then
potential wetness to end the month.  Ridging to the west of Alaska would st=
eer
storms away from the Alaska Panhandle, so despite some potential Week-2
wetness, dry conditions are likely to prevail in the net for southern mainl=
and
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Small reductions to the probabilities for
below normal precipitation were made across the Southwest and Southern
California to account for the impacts of the potential negative PNA and lag=
ged
MJO impacts later in the month, though those are highly uncertain as indica=
ted
in the Week 3-4 outlooks EC.





------------------------ Previous Discussion Follows ----------------------=
---



The January 2022 temperature and precipitation outlooks are based on the
predicted patterns for the Week 3-4 period from the multiple linear regress=
ion
tool, a subset of dynamical models for the Week 3-4 period, La Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa
composites,
lagged MJO composites, and dynamical model guidance.  The outlook reflects =
the
ongoing La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa, as below-average sea surface temperatures=
 continue across
the
central and eastern equatorial Pacific, while suppressed convection was
observed near and west of the Date Line this past month. The oceanic and
atmospheric observations reflect La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions which =
are likely to
persist
through the winter. The MJO strengthened recently, and may be a major facto=
r
in
the January temperature and precipitation patterns over Alaska and the CONU=
S.



La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites would generally favor colder than norma=
l conditions across
the northern tier, and warmer conditions across the southern tier of the
CONUS.
 The dynamical model guidance from the NMME and C3S generally reflects that
pattern, though a bit warmer than expected over the eastern CONUS compared =
to
composites.  Lagged impacts from the MJO, currently in phase 7, would favor=
 a
colder first half the month for much of the CONUS. That signal is also part=
ly
reflected in the Week 3-4 MLR tool and many of the Week 3-4 dynamical model=
s.
A continuation of a robust MJO signal through Phases 8,1, and 2 would resul=
t
in
a pattern flip for the latter half of the month, and that increases
uncertainty
for this outlook. The increased uncertainty is reflected in modest
probabilities and low coverage where signals are destructive and patterns a=
re
most likely to flip mid-month.



The temperature outlook has a broad area of EC in the Plains, where the NMM=
E
and C3S dynamical models strongly favor above normal temperatures, but MJO
composites and shorter-term guidance favor a colder start to the month, so =
the
official outlook is colder than the models across much of the central and
eastern CONUS. MJO impacts to temperature from the Rockies to the West Coas=
t
are usually smaller (lower correlations in the lagged composites), so the w=
arm
signal was retained for the Southern Rockies and the cool signal for the
Pacific Northwest. There are some tools that would indicate below normal
temperatures across the Northern Plains as well, but those signals are weak=
 in
the monthly outlooks, and transient if related to MJO, so the cool signal f=
rom
the Pacific Northwest is not translated eastward. Lagged MJO composites and
the
MLR tool favor some relative warmth to start the month for western Alaska, =
so
probabilities for below normal temperatures from the dynamical models and L=
a
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites are muted there. Signals for below normal =
temperatures are
retained for southern Mainland Alaska and parts of the Alaska Peninsula as
those areas have less destructive interference from the intraseasonal
variability to offset the whole-month guidance and reflection of seasonal
scale
influences.



The precipitation outlook largely resembles La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa compos=
ites and dynamical
model guidance, though a bit drier in the Ohio and Tennessee Valley due to =
the
potential early month cold/trough leading to a southward push of the mean
storm
track early in Jan 2022. Odds for below normal precipitation across the
southern tier are more modest due to the early month potential for impacts
from
the MJO to have some tropical connections for moisture and troughing near t=
he
West Coast. Lagged MJO composites favor storminess shifted northward across
the
Bering Sea early in the month, so above normal precipitation is favored for
the
western Coast of Alaska, and below normal precipitation probabilities are
slightly elevated for the southern coast of Mainland Alaska. That forecast
pattern represents a small shift from the monthly dynamical model guidance.

the east in ensemble means, while the ECMWF predicts a quicker transition
relative to the GEFS. Anomalous ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomali=
es
are predicted across most of the southern CONUS.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated over Ala=
ska
under enhanced northerly flow ahead of the predicted center of high pressur=
e.
A
trough centered over the north-central CONUS favors elevated probabilities =
for
below normal temperatures for northern areas of the Pacific Northwest, much=
 of
the central CONUS, and western areas of the Northeast. The GEFS predicts mo=
re
extensive below normal temperatures into the Southeast, compared to the ECM=
WF
ensemble temperature forecasts. A building ridge over the West leads to
increased chances of near to above normal temperatures for most of the West=
.
Positive 500-hPa height anomalies enhance probabilities for above normal
temperatures along the Gulf Coast.

Mean northerly flow, associated with above normal 500-hPa heights, leads to
increased chances of near to below normal precipitation over western and
central Alaska. Above normal precipitation is favored for the southern Alas=
ka
Panhandle ahead of onshore flow. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow
increases chances of above normal precipitation for much of the northwester=
n
CONUS extending to the northern Great Plains and Great Lakes region. Above
normal precipitation is also favored over much of the eastern CONUS, ahead =
of
the predicted trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for muc=
h
of
the Southwest and the Southern and Central Plains consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on most features of the longwave circulation pattern,
offset by some significant differences among the model temperature and
precipitation tools with a changing pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 08 - 14 2022

The week-2 model forecasts depict a transition in the circulation pattern f=
rom
the 6-10 day period forecast. Ridging persists to the northwest of Alaska i=
nto
the week 2 period, while a trough to the south of the Aleutians influences =
the
forecast downstream. A ridge is forecast over the western CONUS, while the
predicted trough over the CONUS in the 6-10 day period is predicted to
progress
northeastward with rising mid-level heights forecast over most of the CONUS=
.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for most of Alaska outside o=
f
the Alaska Panhandle for week 2, supported by the temperature consolidation
tool. Below normal temperatures are favored over the Great Lakes region and
much of the northeastern CONUS, under northerly flow behind the predicted
trough. Although, there is uncertainty among the model temperature tools wi=
th
the GEFS predicting more extensive below normal temperatures across much of
the
East. Near to above normal temperatures are favored over most of the wester=
n
half of the CONUS, as mid-level heights are predicted to rise during the
period. Above normal temperatures are favored for the Lower Mississippi Val=
ley
and the Gulf Coast, supported by the temperature consolidation tool.

There is significant uncertainty in the precipitation forecast for week 2, =
as
the circulation pattern changes. Below normal precipitation is slightly
favored
for the west coast of Mainland Alaska, under predicted northerly flow. Abov=
e
normal precipitation is slightly favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle with onshore flow. Above normal precipitation is favor=
ed
for parts of the northern Great Lakes region, supported by dynamical model
forecasts. Near to below normal precipitation is favored across the western
and
central CONUS, under the predicted ridge. Near normal precipitation is
indicated for most of the eastern CONUS, where there is significant
uncertainty
among precipitation tools. Above normal precipitation is favored for the
western Gulf Coast, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair model agreement on the transitioning circulation pattern for week=
 2,
as well as weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

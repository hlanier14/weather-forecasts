Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 PM CST Tue Feb 22 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND THE
WESTERN TRANS-PECOS...

Model guidance has exhibited a slowing trend in the upper level
trough's eastward progression. Critical highlights have been
expanded westward and trimmed slightly on the eastern edge to
account for this trend.

..Wendt.. 02/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Tue Feb 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough and attendant 100 kt speed max over the southern
Great Basin are forecast to begin moving east across the
Southwest/southern Rockies Wednesday. As the trough and jet move
eastward, a strong cyclone will develop across the southern Great
Basin. Strong flow aloft associated with the powerful mid-level jet
and cyclone will overspread much of northern MX, southern NM and
southwest TX, supporting strong surface winds. Dry fuels along with
the warm and windy conditions will likely support critical fire
weather conditions Wednesday.

...Southern New Mexico...
Ahead of the eastward-moving trough and strong speed max, dry and
warm surface conditions are likely across much of southern NM. Deep
vertical mixing will support strong momentum transport to the
surface, where widespread critical winds of 25-35+ mph are expected
through the afternoon. Low surface humidity from dry trajectories
and warm temperatures will support minimum RH values of 8-15%.
Fuels, while not overly favorable, are sufficiently dry to support
elevated/critical fire weather conditions Wednesday.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Gusty southwest surface winds off the Mexican Plateau will
overspread the western Rio Grande Valley Wednesday, ahead of the
deepening western US trough. Downslope winds of 15-20 mph will
support dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20% through the first
half of Wednesday. Fuels remain quite dry suggesting elevated fire
weather conditions are likely.

An increase in surface winds is possible later in the afternoon and
early evening as the upper trough to the west begins to eject
eastward. A strong 100 kt speed max ahead of the trough is forecast
to move over northeastern MX and southwest TX late. The increase in
surface momentum transfer may support gusts of 20-35 mph near
sunset. Uncertainty exists on the impact the increase in winds may
have on fire weather conditions given rapid cooling and
boundary-layer separation after dark. Nonetheless, some potential
for locally critical conditions may develop late with the strong
winds and dry fuels.

152 AM EST Wed Feb 23 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 26 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 02 2022

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early to mid next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
18 UTC GEFS mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Despite
reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolutions, emphasis on
any individual model does not seem prudent given recent run to run
continuity issues and variance with embedded weather features.
While southern stream differences actually seem a bit less
pronounced than yesterday, the last few ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble
mean runs trended much flatter over the central to eastern U.S.
with northern stream upper troughing this weekend into early next
week despite amplified upstream ridging over western North
America. While embedded system wavelength spacing could support
this trend around a Hudson Bay vortex position, instead have
leaned the WPC solution to a more amplified and colder 18 UTC GEFS
mean or probably the slightly less amplified 00 UTC GEFS mean.
This plan best maintains WPC product continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will also favor drier
conditions. An exception may be across the south-central to
southeastern U.S. where precipitation could return this weekend.
This will be mainly in the form of light to moderate cold rains,
but with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the
swath of precipitation. In addition, modest precipitation is
expected to develop for the Pacific Northwest/Northern CA this
weekend with slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.
Precipitation totals are forecast to increase over the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA and gradually spread across the northwestern
states early-mid next week, including terrain enhanced snows.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND THE
WESTERN TRANS-PECOS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a potent upper trough and jet streak are forecast
to move out of the southern Great Basin and across the southern
Rockies through this evening. Ahead of the trough, a backdoor cold
front is forecast to slowly move westward as an arctic airmass
spills into the southern Plains. Strong southwesterly winds are
expected at the surface ahead of the front across southern NM and
far southwest Texas. In combination with dry surface conditions, the
gusty winds will support critical fire weather conditions within dry
fuels.

...Southern New Mexico and Trans Pecos...
As the aforementioned upper trough/jet move eastward into the
southern Rockies, warm and dry surface conditions will be present
within a well-mixed boundary layer. Evident on regional model
soundings, the deep boundary layer will intersect with strong flow
aloft, facilitating efficient momentum transfer to the surface.
Widespread winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are expected through
the afternoon. In conjunction with the strong winds and dry fuels,
surface humidity ranging from 6 to 15% will support widespread
critical fire weather conditions across southern NM and southwest
TX.

Farther southeast along the Rio Grande Valley, weaker winds are
expected through the day due to the later arrival of the upper
trough and jet. Westerly downslope flow off the Mexican High Plateau
will still likely reach 10-20 mph through afternoon, with adiabatic
drying supporting surface RH of 10-20%. Dry fuels and the favorable
meteorological conditions will support elevated fire weather
conditions through the day. A low risk for fire weather conditions
may linger after dark with the arrival of stronger mid-level winds.
However, the decoupling boundary layer and RH recoveries near 50%
will likely limit the potential for significant fire weather
concerns overnight.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As the strong western US trough ejects eastward across the southern
Rockies/Plains early Thursday, the system will gradually begin to
deamplify as the attendant mid-level jet races ahead. A surface low
and Pacific front over the southern Rockies will move southeastward,
weakening as they approach the Arctic airmass across the southern
Plains. Behind the front, gusty westerly winds and cooler
temperatures will overspread much of the Southwest. The gusty winds
may remain strong enough to support a low-end fire weather risk
across southern NM and southwest TX Thursday.

...Southern New Mexico and Southwest Texas...
The cold front and surface low are forecast to weaken significantly
as they transit southern NM/southwest TX early Thursday morning.
This will result in a slackening of the westerly surface pressure
gradient through much of the day. Despite the weakening, some model
soundings do show sufficient mid-level flow to potentially support
winds of 10-20 mph through the afternoon. The cooler but drier
airmass behind the front should also remain favorable for surface RH
of 15-25% through the diurnal cycle. Dry fuels and the somewhat
favorable meteorological conditions suggest that locally elevated
fire weather conditions are possible through the afternoon hours,
though considerable uncertainty remains. Highlights will be withheld
for now, though a small elevated area may be needed if greater model
consensus is reached.

...Significant winter storm impacting the Southern Plains to the
Ohio Valley on Wednesday into Thursday night then the Northeast
Thursday night into Friday...

...Risk of Excessive rainfall from the Lower Mississippi to
Tennessee Valleys through Thursday morning and over the Tennessee
and Ohio Valley on Thursday into Friday morning...

...A Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the Southern
Rockies through Thursday morning...

...Temperatures will be 20 to 40 degrees below average over the
Northern/Central Rockies, Plains, and the Mississippi Valley; In
contrast, temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over
East Coast...

By Thursday morning, a storm over the Southwest will move eastward
to the Southern Rockies. On Thursday, the storm will redevelop
over the Tennessee Valley and move northeastward to the Central
Appalachians/ Mid-Atlantic by Friday. The storm will produce heavy
snow over the Southwest and Central Rockies on Wednesday, with
light rain over parts of Southern California and rain at lower
elevations of the Southwest. Furthermore, strong wind and dry
fuels will produce conditions favorable for a Critical Risk of
fire weather over parts of the Southern Rockies through Thursday
morning.

Moreover, as the storm moves out of the Southern Rockies, the
system will bring a variety of winter hazards from the Southern
Plains through the Ohio Valley Wednesday through Thursday night
and the Northeast Thursday night through Friday. Damaging ice
accumulations across the Ozarks up to 0.50 inches leading to power
outages and tree damage are possible. This ice is within a swath
of notable accumulations of freezing rain and sleet expected from
North Texas through the Mid-Mississippi Valley. Overnight
Thursday, heavy snow will develop over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes. As the system moves to
the Central Appalachians/ Mid-Atlantic on Friday morning, heavy
snow will develop over parts of the Northeast into Southern New
England. Widespread amounts greater than 6 inches are likely.
Another rain/freezing rain area is likely from the Eastern Ohio
Valley through the Central Appalachians. Significant ice
accumulations are possible across south-central Pennsylvania and
western Maryland. Prepare now for this major winter storm.
Widespread hazardous travel and damage to the power infrastructure
are expected.

Additional impacts will be temperatures 20 to 40 degrees below
average over the Northern/Central Rockies, Plains, and the
Mississippi Valley. As a result, several locations will have
record-breaking or tied low temperatures. In contrast,
temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over most of
the East Coast, with several locations having record-breaking or
tied high temperatures from Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

In the meantime, a cold front extending from the Northeast
southwestward to the Southern Plains will have a strong stream of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and overruns the front producing
heavy rain over Lower Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with heavy rain over parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys through Thursday morning. The heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable. On Thursday, the excessive
rainfall threat moves eastward and expands as heavy rain moves
into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with heavy rain over parts of
the Tennessee and Ohio Valley on Thursday into Friday morning. The
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.
Furthermore, the rain will continue from the Tennessee/Lower
Mississippi Valleys into the Western Gulf Coast overnight Thursday
into Friday.

Lastly, upper-level energy moving southward from Western Canada
will move over the Pacific Northwest early Thursday morning and
the Central Rockies by Friday. For Thursday, the energy will
produce light snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest down to the
coast and inland to the Northern Rockies. Overnight Thursday, the
light snow moves into the Central Rockies.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CDT Thu Oct 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low will slowly track
across the Ohio/Tennessee Valley areas through the day, with dry,
deep-layer northwesterly flow prevailing across the south-central
U.S. Near-critical to Critically dry and breezy surface conditions
are expected across portions of western Oklahoma into northwest
Texas. However, fuels are expected to remain poorly receptive to
fire spread at best given recent heavy rains, hence no introduction
of fire weather highlights.

Two narrow corridors exist though, for dry and breezy northwesterly
surface winds to overspread cured grasses relatively devoid of
recent rainfall accumulations, where Elevated highlights have been
maintained. First, widespread 15-20 mph sustained northwesterly
surface winds overlapping with 20% RH are likely across portions of
southeast Colorado/southwest Kansas into the Texas Panhandle.
Second, across Deep South Texas, surface northwesterly winds will
struggle to sustain above 15 mph for multiple consecutive hours,
though RH is expected to dip below 15% for several locales through
the afternoon.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 28 2021

SYNOPSIS: An end to the growing season is becoming more likely by the
beginning
of week-2 over a large portion of the eastern half of the contiguous U.S.
Surface high pressure is favored to expand over the region resulting in
anomalously cold temperatures across the region early in the period, with m=
any
interior locations possibly experiencing their first frost or freeze during
the
period. After a predicted lull in precipitation along the West Coast from t=
his
weekend into early next week, above-normal precipitation is expected to ret=
urn
to the Pacific Northwest and northern California during week-2. As the stor=
m
track shifts south over the North Pacific, the risk for hazardous weather
across Alaska is expected to diminish.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Great Plain=
s,
Corn Belt, Tennessee Valley, Central to Southern Appalachians, and interior
mid-Atlantic, Fri-Sat, Nov 5-6.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the central and
eastern U.S., Fri-Mon, Nov 5-8.

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) for the
Pacific Northwest and northern California, Sat-Mon, Nov 6-8.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation (rain and high-elevation snow) for the
Pacific Northwest and northern California, Fri-Thu, Nov 5-11.

Moderate risk of heavy snow for the Cascades, Sat-Mon, Nov 6-8.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Cascades, Fri-Thu, Nov 5-11.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the northern Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the
northern portions of the Great Basin and Rockies, Sat-Thu, Nov 6-11.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the western U.S., Fri-Thu, Nov 5-11.

FOR FRIDAY NOVEMBER 05 - THURSDAY NOVEMBER 11: The coldest temperatures so =
far
this fall season are likely across the central U.S. at the beginning of
November, with the anomalous cold expected to overspread the eastern U.S.
during the early portion of the week-2 period. The ECMWF reforecast tool
remains the most bullish with probabilities exceeding 60 percent that minim=
um
temperatures fall into the lowest 15th percentile over the Great Plains and
Corn Belt from 11/5 to 11/6. The GEFS reforecast tool maintains lower
probabilities for minimum temperatures reaching this threshold compared to =
the
ECMWF tool, but the probabilities in the GEFS tool are higher relative to
yesterday. A moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is highlighte=

over a large area of the eastern U.S. from 11/5-11/6. The southern Great
Plains, along with the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, have yet to experience a
freeze, but the end of the growing season is expected during the first week=
 of
November with this outbreak of anomalous cold. Additionally, probabilities =
of
temperatures dropping below 38 deg F have increased to above 40 percent in =
the
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble guidance across portions of the interior
mid-Atlantic, and these areas are now included in the moderate risk due to =
the
increasing threat for a first frost. The slight risk for much below normal
temperatures extends closer to the Gulf Coast and includes areas where
temperature tools depict at least a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling below 40 deg F, supporting the potential for frost. As a 500-hPa
trough
approaches the West Coast, a moderating trend in temperatures is expected f=
or
the east-central U.S. later in week-2. Due to this evolving longwave patter=
n
upstream and increasing differences between the GEFS and ECMWF temperature
tools later in the period, the slight risk of much below normal temperature=
s
is
discontinued after 11/8.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in excellent agreement that an amplif=
ied
500-hPa trough develops over the northeast Pacific with enhanced Pacific fl=
ow
returning to western North America during week-2. Given this excellent
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, guidance from reforeca=
st
precipitation tools, and an increasing chance of an atmospheric river event=
, a
moderate risk of heavy precipitation (more than 2 inches per 24 hours) is
posted for the Pacific Northwest and parts of northern California from
11/6-11/8. A slight risk of heavy precipitation covers a larger spatial ext=
ent
and is posted for all of week-2. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts this hea=
vy
precipitation potential extending further south into California compared to
the
GEFS, leading to more uncertainty. Most of the coastal Pacific Northwest an=
d
northern California has received more than 10 inches of liquid equivalent
precipitation during the past month. Due to the antecedent wetness, additio=
nal
heavy rain could trigger flooding. Also, heavy rain may lead to mudslides a=
nd
debris flows in burn scar areas. Based on the likelihood of anomalous
troughing, a moderate risk of heavy snow (more than 12 inches per 24 hours)=
 is
posted for the Cascades from Nov 6 to 8 with a slight risk posted for the
entire period. Due to more uncertainty on how far south the enhanced onshor=
e
flow extends along the West Coast, only a slight risk of heavy snow is post=
ed
for the Sierra Nevada Mountains from 11/6-11/11. A slight risk of heavy sno=
w
is
also highlighted across northern portions of the Rockies and Great Basin fo=
r
11/6-11/11, given the anticipated inland propagation of the moisture flow,
combined with cold air in place at the higher elevations. The amplified 500=
-
hPa
trough also supports a slight risk of high winds from the West Coast to the
Continental Divide for all of week-2.



Several 6z GEFS ensemble members depict surface low pressure off the northe=
ast
coast of the U.S. at the onset of week-2, with deterministic solutions
oscillating between a track close to the coast (6z, 12z) and further offsho=
re
(0z). The 0z deterministic ECMWF also depicts a more inland track, although
there is limited ensemble support in the ECMWF for this solution. Due to th=
e
lack of model agreement, no related hazards are depicted. However, if a
surface
low develops and tracks close enough to the coast, there could be impacts f=
rom
heavy precipitation (snow mixing in at inland higher elevations cannot be
ruled
out given the forecast cold air mass in place). Increased northwesterlies
behind this system over the anomalously warm Great Lakes could result in
elevated chances for lake effect snow, although surface temperatures during
the
day may be too warm, and given the uncertainty in the overall threat, no
related hazard is highlighted.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The models and ensemble means continue to show the large scale
flow settling into a regime that features a strong mean ridge over
western Canada, a more modest ridge over the western U.S., and a
mean trough extending from the eastern half of Canada into the
central and eastern U.S.  Two Pacific shortwaves will likely head
into western mean ridge, one early in the week and another around
Thursday.  The overall pattern will support an expanding area of
below normal temperatures to the east of the Rockies.  By mid-late
week the front defining the leading side of cooler air will help
to focus an area of precipitation--some of it potentially
heavy--from the southern Plains northeastward.  The eastern
Pacific shortwaves will produce a couple episodes of enhanced
precipitation along parts of the central and northern West Coast,
while a fairly narrow axis of rain/snow may extend across the
central Rockies/Plains early in the period.

Overall the guidance shows better agreement than seen 24-36 hours
ago.  Early in the period there are still a couple smaller scale
uncertainties.  The 00Z GFS was a bit slow with the system opening
up as it crosses New England late in the weekend, with more recent
runs trending faster toward the consensus.  Meanwhile the models
have been continually challenged by the compact upper low over or
near Oregon by early Sunday.  Even in the new 12Z runs there is
still some lingering spread for the ultimate fate of the energy
that shears out, but with seemingly minimal impact on the general
pattern thereafter.  Then models are trending closer together for
the first shortwave that arrives from the Pacific, with the weak
consensus depiction appearing reasonable given that the energy is
heading into a mean ridge over the West.  Not surprisingly there
is more spread with the next batch of shortwave energy that
approaches the West Coast around Wednesday-Thursday.  By next
Thursday the 00Z CMC used the northern part to break down the
Canadian ridge more than other guidance, favoring removal of that
run from the blend.  The 00Z ECMWF strayed a bit to the faster
side with what reaches California but could still be used as part
of a guidance average.  Guidance continues to vary with the
details of upper troughing east of the Rockies by the latter half
of the period, which leads to increasing spread and run-to-run
variability for specifics of the wavy front over the
southern/eastern U.S. along with associated precipitation
(especially over the East).  Likely due to the aforementioned
issues with the western Canada ridge, the 00Z CMC showed a more
neutrally tilted eastern upper trough and suppressed surface
pattern.  A model/mean blend by late in the period (evenly split
among the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean by day 7
Thursday) still led to some continuity adjustments, but less than
seen in some individual solutions.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The two shortwaves/frontal systems expected to reach the West
Coast during the period should bring a couple episodes of enhanced
precipitation.  The first should bring highest totals to northern
California and the far southwest corner of Oregon early next week.
 Currently expect the second to bring highest amounts to a similar
area by around Thursday but it is also possible that a meaningful
amount of moisture could reach the Pacific Northwest.  There is
some timing uncertainty with this latter event as well.  A fairly
narrow band of rain and snow should set up over parts of the
central Rockies/Plains early in the week, with lingering
uncertainty over exact location and amounts.  There is some
potential for locally moderate activity for a time.  An expanding
area of precipitation should cover locations from the southern
Plains northeastward by Tuesday or Wednesday into Thursday, with a
wavy front providing some focus.  The best potential for heavier
rainfall extends from northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma into
parts of Arkansas/Louisiana, with decreasing confidence in
specifics the farther northeastward one goes.

The only notable temperature hazard is below to much below normal
temperatures expanding across much of the Central U.S. during the
period.  A large portion of the Plains and locations farther east
into the Mississippi Valley and then Tennessee/Ohio Valleys (and
perhaps even the central Appalachians by Thursday) should see one
or more days with highs 10-20F below climatological values for
this time of year.  Currently expect the axis of coolest anomalies
to extend from the central Plains to along or south of the Ohio
River.  Anomalies for min temperatures should be less extreme but
could still be noteworthy for producing the first freeze in some
areas from the central Plains into the Midwest and possibly other
nearby areas around next Tuesday or so.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 03 - 07 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model solutions a=
re in good agreement with
the
overall 500-hPa height pattern across the forecast domain during the 6-10 d=
ay
period. Near- to below-normal mid-level heights are predicted over extreme
southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, and above-normal mid-level
heights are forecast over the remainder of the state. Over much of the west=
ern
Contiguous U.S. (CONUS), the predicted mean 500-hPa heights have fallen sin=
ce
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day forecast. Positive height an=
omalies are favored from
the
northern Rockies to the Northern Plains while negative height anomalies are
predicted for the Central and Southern Plains and the eastern third of the
U.S.

Mean surface low pressure off the southern coast of Mainland Alaska favors
predominantly southerly flow and elevated odds of above-normal temperatures
across much of central and eastern Alaska. To the west and north of this
surface low pressure, easterly and northerly winds increase probabilities o=
f
near- to below-normal temperatures across western Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians. Near-normal temperature probabilities are favored across the
western
third of the CONUS, as models depict varying intensities of mid-level heigh=
t
anomalies over the region. In addition, below-normal sea surface temperatur=
es
and warm, southwesterly mean flow will act to offset one another. Over most=
 of
the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS, an amplified mean trough leads to
enhanced
chances of below-normal temperatures east of the Rockies. Above-normal
temperatures are weakly favored across the southern Florida Peninsula, ahea=
d
of
a mean frontal boundary.

Underneath predominantly southerly surface flow, above-normal precipitation=
 is
favored across south-central Mainland Alaska. Below-normal precipitation is
weakly favored across southwestern Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutian=
s,
to the north and west of mean surface low pressure. Probabilities of
above-normal precipitation across the western CONUS are enhanced as the mea=
n
mid-level trough has continued its eastward progression since yesterday=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-
10
day forecast, leading to increased onshore flow in the West. With the weakn=
ess
in the mid-level heights over the West, a southerly storm track is forecast=
,
enhancing probabilities of above-normal precipitation across much of the
Southern Tier of the CONUS and along the Eastern Seaboard. Surface high
pressure is expected to dominate from the Northern Plains to the Great Lake=
s,
enhancing odds of below-normal precipitation. From southeastern Arizona
eastward to the Rio Grande Valley, below-normal precipitation is favored, a=

the storm track is likely to remain farther north.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF and GEFS ensemble m=
odel solutions, offset by
differences in the predicted 500-hPa heights fields over the western CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 05 - 11 2021

The week-2 500-hPa height pattern depicts a slight eastward progression of =
the
6-10 day mid-level height pattern and deamplification over the CONUS.
Near-normal 500-hPa heights are favored over much northern Alaska. Positive
mid-level height anomalies are predicted over the extreme western Aleutians=
,
with negative mid-level height anomalies favored over southern Alaska, unde=
r
greater influence from mean surface low pressure over the Northeast Pacific=
.
The leading edge of a mean mid-level trough over the Northeast Pacific has
continued its eastward progression, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs week-2 forecast,
leading to below-normal 500-hPa heights across the northwestern CONUS.
Troughing in the east is deamplified, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast, but
below-normal mid-level heights remain the most likely outcome from the
Southern
Plains to the East Coast. Positive mid-level height anomalies from the
Northern
Plains to the Great Lakes are associated with a northward-displaced amplifi=
ed
ridge over Canada.

The slight eastward progression of the mean trough over the Northeast Pacif=
ic
increases easterly surface flow to the north across Alaska, leading to
enhanced
near- to below-normal temperature probabilities across central and western
Alaska. A slight southerly component to the mean surface flow tilts odds
toward
above-normal temperatures in eastern portions of the Alaska Mainland. Farth=
er
to the south, above-normal temperatures are favored for much of the
west-central CONUS, and eastward to the northern Great Lakes, as near- to
above-normal mid-level heights are favored across these areas. Uncertainty =
is
noted with respect to the strength and sign of the mid-level height anomali=
es
stretching from the Southwest to the Great Lakes; however, the GEFS and ECM=
WF
ensemble reforecast temperature fields show good spatial agreement with the
above-normal probabilities. In the eastern CONUS, mean troughing, though
deamplified since yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 forecast, le=
ads to enhanced odds of
below-normal temperatures from the Central and Southern Plains to the East
Coast.

With continued eastward progression of the mean mid-level trough over the
Northeast Pacific, increased easterly and northeasterly flow favors near- t=
o
below-normal precipitation across most of Alaska. Odds tilt toward above-
normal
precipitation across the northeastern Mainland Alaska, as surface high
pressure
over the Arctic Ocean is favored to increase onshore flow from the Beaufort
Sea. The eastward progression of this trough also favors enhanced
probabilities
of above-normal precipitation across much of the western CONUS due to
increased
onshore flow. The predicted weakness in the mid-level height field over the
west-central CONUS favors a progressive pattern and an active storm track
across much of the Southern Tier and along the Eastern Seaboard, at the bas=
e
and ahead of the mean trough axis in the East. Behind the mean trough axis,
below-normal precipitation is favored from the Great Lakes to the Tennessee
Valley. Below-normal precipitation odds are increased from southeastern
Arizona
to western Texas, as the mean storm track is likely to remain farther to th=
e
north.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 45% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
increased agreement among the model fields, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Thu Oct 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level trough and surface low across the eastern third of the
CONUS responsible for the southern Plains dry and breezy conditions
today/Day 1 will only gradually progress eastward tomorrow/Friday.
Though deep-layer (including surface) northwesterly flow will not be
as strong as it was today/Day 1, the air will remain dry, promoting
at least some grass-fire spread within a narrow corridor west of
where recent heavy rainfall has occurred. 15 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will coincide with 15-20% RH atop dry
fuels from the eastern Texas Panhandle to the Rio Grande/Deep-South
Texas, prompting the introduction of Elevated highlights given
sufficiently dry fine fuels.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Olympic Peninsula and the Northern Cascades through Friday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic Coast through Friday
morning...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Plains...

A cold front moving into the Pacific Northwest will stream
moisture into parts of northwestern Washington State, producing
rain over parts of the Olympic Peninsula and the Northern Cascades
through Friday evening, with the rain being heavy at times.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of the Olympic Peninsula and the Northern Cascades
through Friday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable.  The intensity of the
moisture coming off the Pacific weakens on Friday morning;
consequently, the threat of excessive rainfall ends on Friday.
Moreover, the associate cold front will move eastward to the Upper
Midwest to the Central Rockies, then into the Great Basin and
California by Saturday.  The moisture pooling along the cold front
will produce light rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern California on Friday into Saturday.

However, a deep area of low pressure over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys will slowly move
northeastward to the northern Mid-Atlantic by Saturday evening.
The associated cold front will produce showers and thunderstorms
over parts of the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic Coast on
Thursday afternoon into Friday morning; some of the thunderstorms
will be severe.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic Coast through Friday morning.  The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, a few tornadoes, and minimal risk for
hail.

The system will also produce rain over parts of the Upper Midwest
into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  The storm will pull moisture
off the Atlantic and, to a lesser extent, from the Gulf of Mexico.
 The system will produce mainly rain over parts of the eastern
third of the country, with the rain being heavy at times.
Accordingly, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic/Central
Appalachians on Friday into Saturday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most.  On Saturday,
the threat of excessive rainfall decreases to a Marginal Risk over
parts of the Northeast.

Meanwhile, a narrow corridor of dry and breezy northwesterly
surface wind develops over parts of the Southern Plains, producing
an area favorable for fire weather through Saturday morning; hence
region of Elevated Risk of fire weather is over the Southern
Plains.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The models and ensemble means continue to show the large scale
flow settling into a regime that features a strong mean ridge over
western Canada, a more modest ridge over the western U.S., and a
mean trough extending from the eastern half of Canada into the
central and eastern U.S.  Two Pacific shortwaves will likely head
into western mean ridge, one early in the week and another around
Thursday.  The overall pattern will support an expanding area of
below normal temperatures to the east of the Rockies.  By mid-late
week the front defining the leading side of cooler air will help
to focus an area of precipitation--some of it potentially
heavy--from the southern Plains northeastward.  The eastern
Pacific shortwaves will produce a couple episodes of enhanced
precipitation along parts of the central and northern West Coast,
while a fairly narrow axis of rain/snow may extend across the
central Rockies/Plains early in the period.

Overall the guidance shows better agreement than seen 24-36 hours
ago.  Early in the period there are still a couple smaller scale
uncertainties.  The 00Z GFS was a bit slow with the system opening
up as it crosses New England late in the weekend, with more recent
runs trending faster toward the consensus.  Meanwhile the models
have been continually challenged by the compact upper low over or
near Oregon by early Sunday.  Even in the new 12Z runs there is
still some lingering spread for the ultimate fate of the energy
that shears out, but with seemingly minimal impact on the general
pattern thereafter.  Then models are trending closer together for
the first shortwave that arrives from the Pacific, with the weak
consensus depiction appearing reasonable given that the energy is
heading into a mean ridge over the West.  Not surprisingly there
is more spread with the next batch of shortwave energy that
approaches the West Coast around Wednesday-Thursday.  By next
Thursday the 00Z CMC used the northern part to break down the
Canadian ridge more than other guidance, favoring removal of that
run from the blend.  The 00Z ECMWF strayed a bit to the faster
side with what reaches California but could still be used as part
of a guidance average.  Guidance continues to vary with the
details of upper troughing east of the Rockies by the latter half
of the period, which leads to increasing spread and run-to-run
variability for specifics of the wavy front over the
southern/eastern U.S. along with associated precipitation
(especially over the East).  Likely due to the aforementioned
issues with the western Canada ridge, the 00Z CMC showed a more
neutrally tilted eastern upper trough and suppressed surface
pattern.  A model/mean blend by late in the period (evenly split
among the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean by day 7
Thursday) still led to some continuity adjustments, but less than
seen in some individual solutions.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The two shortwaves/frontal systems expected to reach the West
Coast during the period should bring a couple episodes of enhanced
precipitation.  The first should bring highest totals to northern
California and the far southwest corner of Oregon early next week.
 Currently expect the second to bring highest amounts to a similar
area by around Thursday but it is also possible that a meaningful
amount of moisture could reach the Pacific Northwest.  There is
some timing uncertainty with this latter event as well.  A fairly
narrow band of rain and snow should set up over parts of the
central Rockies/Plains early in the week, with lingering
uncertainty over exact location and amounts.  There is some
potential for locally moderate activity for a time.  An expanding
area of precipitation should cover locations from the southern
Plains northeastward by Tuesday or Wednesday into Thursday, with a
wavy front providing some focus.  The best potential for heavier
rainfall extends from northeast Texas and southeast Oklahoma into
parts of Arkansas/Louisiana, with decreasing confidence in
specifics the farther northeastward one goes.

The only notable temperature hazard is below to much below normal
temperatures expanding across much of the Central U.S. during the
period.  A large portion of the Plains and locations farther east
into the Mississippi Valley and then Tennessee/Ohio Valleys (and
perhaps even the central Appalachians by Thursday) should see one
or more days with highs 10-20F below climatological values for
this time of year.  Currently expect the axis of coolest anomalies
to extend from the central Plains to along or south of the Ohio
River.  Anomalies for min temperatures should be less extreme but
could still be noteworthy for producing the first freeze in some
areas from the central Plains into the Midwest and possibly other
nearby areas around next Tuesday or so.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1257 AM CDT Fri Oct 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A large upper low, currently over the Tennessee Valley, will move
northeast into the Ohio Valley through the day today. A surface low
will also accompany this upper low and follow a similar path. On the
western periphery of this broad cyclone, dry and windy northerly
winds are expected across portions of the southern Plains. This is
forecast to occur as a result of a strong surface pressure gradient
as well as deep mixing. This will lead to strengthening surface
winds across much of western and central Oklahoma into a large
portion of northern/central and southern Texas. However, much of
this area has seen significant rainfall recently. Therefore, the
elevated outline has been confined to western portions of this area
where little to no recent rainfall has fallen and fuels are drier.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mostly benign fire weather conditions are expected on Saturday. Some
dry and breezy conditions may develop in portions of southeast
Colorado and western Kansas in the wake of a southward-moving cold
front. However, fuels are not that dry in this area due to recent
rainfall. Elsewhere conditions will be too moist or winds too light
for fire weather concerns.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
310 AM EDT Fri Oct 29 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 01 2021 - 12Z Fri Nov 05 2021

...Overview...

A fairly stagnant upper-level pattern will be in place for much of
the medium range period, with a strong mean ridge over western
Canada, a more modest ridge over the western U.S., and a mean
trough extending from the eastern half of Canada into the central
and eastern U.S., before ridging shifts slowly eastward into the
Plains Thursday and Friday. At the surface, a chilly high pressure
system behind a cold front should cause below normal temperatures
across the central U.S., while the initially slow-moving cold
front enhances rainfall in the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Rounds of precipitation are also possible in
the West as upper-level shortwaves and frontal systems approach.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 12/18Z cycle is in reasonably good
agreement at the beginning of the period with the overall pattern.
Some minor differences in track and timing remain for shortwaves
coming into the Northwest as well as pivoting within the
central/eastern U.S. low amplitude trough, but do not appear to
cause notable differences in the pattern until around Wednesday
onward. At that point, shortwave energy within the eastern trough
appears to pinch off the most in the ECMWF compared to other
guidance, and then model differences arise with upstream energy in
the west side of the trough. By Friday, the 12Z ECMWF has a closed
low across the Ohio Valley separate from the Canadian trough,
which is within the realm of possibilities dependent on the
evolution, but at this point is the only deterministic model to do
so, and the new 00Z run shows a different structure. Additionally,
shortwave energy in a mean trough across the eastern Pacific
varies quite a bit with position and timing from midweek onward.
The ECMWF brings troughing onshore most quickly by early Thursday,
while GFS runs are slow and strong with the energy and
aggressively create a closed low across California by Friday. The
12Z CMC was in between these solutions. Despite the variations in
evolution, at this point there were not clear outliers, and
blending the different solutions together ended up creating a good
compromise forecast. The WPC forecast utilized a deterministic
model blend of the 12Z and 18Z GFS and the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
early in the period, adding the GEFS and EC ensemble means into
the blend by day 6 and 7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The frontal systems and shortwaves coming into the West will cause
periods of enhanced precipitation--first on Monday and then
Wednesday into Friday. Northern California and far southwestern
Oregon should see the heaviest precipitation, with some spreading
into the Pacific Northwest (especially during the latter period)
and lesser totals eastward into the Intermountain West, with
normal terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Some snow
may extend into the central High Plains on Monday into Tuesday,
but amounts remain uncertain. Then as moisture flows into the
vicinity of a frontal system across the south-central U.S.,
rainfall chances will increase on Tuesday into Wednesday for the
Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley. Some
precipitation could spread east and northward for the latter part
of the week, with the higher elevations of the Central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow, but confidence in specifics is low.

Behind the cold front and underneath high pressure, well below
normal temperatures are expected across the central and eastern
U.S., especially in terms of highs. Highs of 10-20F below average
are expected across central portions of the Plains into the Middle
Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley. Chilly lows in the 20s as far
south as Kansas and Iowa are forecast, which is 5-10F below
average, and some areas may experience their first freeze around
next Tuesday or so. Above normal low temperatures are expected
under ridging in the West, though highs should be right around
average.

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 29 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 31 2021

...Strong storm system will continue to bring widespread showers
and thunderstorms, including the risk for flooding, to the East...

...Showers and storms, as well as some higher elevation mountain
snow, will move through the Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...Seasonably warm temperatures for much of the High Plains will
turn cooler behind a cold front by Sunday...


The most significant weather story of the short-term forecast
period (Friday through Sunday morning) will be an anomalously
strong low-pressure system moving northward across the eastern
half of the country through the weekend. At the start of the
period, a low-pressure center in the eastern Ohio Valley will
continue to slowly meander northward into the interior Northeast
by Sunday, with an occluded front moving northward up the East
Coast. Strong, easterly flow from the Atlantic will continue to
funnel moisture along and ahead of the front leading to widespread
heavy rain and some thunderstorms. There is a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for portions of eastern West Virginia, southern
Pennsylvania, northern Virginia, the District of Columbia, and
much of northern and western Maryland. Rainfall amounts of 2-4
inches are likely with locally higher amounts possible, leading to
the risk for some scattered instances of flooding. A Marginal Risk
is in place for a broader portion of the Mid-Alantic northwest to
the eastern Great Lakes for forecast rainfall totals an inch or
more.  Meanwhile, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Marginal Risk for severe weather on Friday for portions of eastern
Virginia and North Carolina as well as southern Maryland due to
the risk of thunderstorms with some gusty winds and an isolated
tornado threat. Additionally, strong, gusty onshore winds will
also lead to some coastal flooding for the Chesapeake Bay and the
Atlantic Coast of Virginia northward to New Jersey through
Saturday afternoon. The rain will spread further northeastward
into New England on Saturday, with another Marginal Risk in place
for forecast rainfall amounts again in the 2-4 inch range. It is
also worth noting high temperatures across the South behind the
system will be unseasonably cool on Friday. Highs will only reach
the mid-50s from Arkansas eastward through most of Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Alabama, as well as portions of Georgia.
Temperatures will warm a bit more on Saturday but still remain
unseasonably cool.

Another frontal system will move through the Northwest and into
the center of the country. Showers and cooler weather are forecast
for the Pacific Northwest as a cold front moves through on Friday.
Higher elevations of the Northern Rockies may also see some snow
showers Saturday as the cold front continues southeastward. Ahead
of the front, seasonably warm temperatures are expected across
portions of the Plains, particularly the High Plains. The Northern
and Central High Plains will see highs in the 60s and lower 70s on
Friday, between 10 to 20 degrees above normal. Highs will cool
into the 40s for the Northern High Plains on Saturday while the
Central High Plains remain warm and the Southern High Plains see
temperatures rise as high as the mid-80s. The front will progress
southward into the Southern Plains by Sunday morning, bringing
freezing low temperatures to much of the Northern and Central
Plains in its wake. In addition to the warmer temperatures,
conditions are expected to remain dry ahead of the front across
the Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted portions
of Texas from the Rio Grande Valley northwestward through the
eastern Texas Panhandle for an Elevated fire weather risk on
Friday due to strong, gusty winds and dry conditions.

Elsewhere, generally tranquil and seasonable conditions will be in
place. Temperatures will be around normal for the Midwest and
Southwest. Florida may see some scattered showers and
thunderstorms both Friday and Saturday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CDT Wed Apr 20 2022

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EXTREME SOUTHEAST
WYOMING INTO THE NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...

12Z Soundings at locations across the Southwest into the western
Plains depict a deep, dry boundary layer in place, which will
further mix through the day given sunny skies. Surface observations
already show Elevated to locally Critical conditions underway across
eastern New Mexico into Arizona, and these conditions should become
more widespread by afternoon peak heating. The eastern portions of
the Elevated delineation in the Texas Panhandle should have the
shortest-lived wildfire-spread threat given the passage of a surface
cold front (located across the northern Texas Panhandle), followed
by relatively calmer winds.

Current RH varies from 25-60 percent across the Nebraska Panhandle.
However, guidance continues to indicate ample mixing through the
day, with 15-20 percent RH and 20+ mph sustained westerly winds
developing by afternoon. Lastly, 15 mph easterly offshore flow and
40 percent RH is present across the western Florida Peninsula. Given
sunny skies, further boundary layer mixing will cause RH to dip into
Elevated thresholds by afternoon. Considering all of the above, no
major changes were made to the previous Day 1 fire weather
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 04/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0210 AM CDT Wed Apr 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad/enhanced westerly flow will continue over the western
two-thirds of the CONUS, while a lee surface low develops over far
northeastern New Mexico. The strongest westerly flow will be
confined to the north-central Rockies, within the base of an
eastward-advancing midlevel trough. Farther east, expansive surface
high pressure will move slowly eastward off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains and Colorado Front
Range...
Another day of warm/dry boundary-layer conditions is forecast across
the Southwest into the southern High Plains and northward along the
Colorado Front Range. Diurnal heating/mixing will encourage
widespread 10-15 percent minimum RH, where breezy westerly surface
winds of 15-25 mph are expected. The strongest surface winds should
develop across much of New Mexico into far West Texas, where
Critical highlights remain in place. Along the Colorado Front Range,
locally critical conditions will be possible primarily across
terrain-favored areas, though the localized nature of these
conditions precludes Critical highlights.

...Central High Plains...
Strong downslope warming/drying and diurnal heating will result in
15-20 percent minimum RH across parts of the central High Plains,
where breezy surface winds will develop. From eastern Wyoming into
the Nebraska Panhandle, 25-30 mph sustained west-northwesterly
surface winds (with gusts upwards of 40 mph) will overspread the
increasingly dry airmass. These meteorological conditions, coupled
with very dry fuels, will result in critical fire-weather
conditions.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
Along the southern periphery of the expansive surface high pressure,
breezy easterly surface winds near 15 mph will overspread the
Florida Peninsula. Over the western portion of the peninsula,
diurnal heating/mixing could result in a narrow corridor of 35-40
percent RH coincident with the breezy surface winds. Elevated
highlights have been introduced to account for this localized
fire-weather threat.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 20 2022

SYNOPSIS: A substantial warm-up is forecast across much of the central and
eastern contiguous U.S. during the week-1 period associated with mid-level
high
pressure. This is forecast to accelerate spring bloom across northern areas
that have seen limited growth thus far. However, a quick flip to a colder
pattern is forecast across the Upper Midwest later in week-1, and anomalous=
ly
cold temperatures are predicted to expand into the Ohio Valley, and interio=
r
parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic by the outset of week-2. Following =
a
short period of anomalously warm temperatures in these regions, minimum
temperatures cold enough to support frost are forecast to become more likel=
y
over newly susceptible vegetation. Mid-level low pressure forecast over the
northeast Pacific early in the period favors much below normal temperatures
across parts of the northwestern contiguous U.S., with the overall pattern
predicted to become more zonal later in week-2, leading to milder temperatu=
res
in the region.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and the interior Mid-Atlantic and Northea=
st,
Thu-Fri, Apr 28-29.

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Northern
Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys,
Appalachians, Great Lakes, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, Thu-T=
ue,
Apr 28-May 3.

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern California, Northern Great Basin, and Northern Rockies,
Thu-Sat, Apr 28-30.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 23 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 27:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!q3KC6WX9FC9ZyXtCwHnpscwPR-uhQeyiDb5FrdVIu3PZBpbIslBJIbPmBdzv7=
tkhblEI5MdL$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 28 - WEDNESDAY MAY 04: During week-1, anomalous ridging =
is
forecast to amplify across the east-central CONUS, resulting in elevated
chances for above normal temperatures. However, this warm-up is forecast to=
 be
short-lived as the predicted negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillati=
on
(NAO), combined with the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) reemerging in phas=
es
8
and 1 this past week, both support a return to a colder pattern across the
eastern half of the CONUS. Following a period of maximum temperatures in th=
e
60s and 70s deg F over much of the east-central CONUS (possibly reaching 80
deg
F in some areas), minimum temperatures may again fall below 40 deg F as
troughing expands over the northeastern CONUS early in week-2. This present=
s a
major concern for agriculture as the sudden warm up will likely accelerate
vegetation growth, and be immediately followed by temperatures cold enough =
to
support a crop damaging frost. Due to the increased risk for agricultural
impacts, a moderate risk for much below normal temperatures continues to be
highlighted across portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Appalachians, =
and
interior portions of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic for Apr 28-29. Over the=
se
regions, there is at least a 40 percent chance of minimum temperatures fall=
ing
below 40 deg F (supporting potential frost) based on GEFS and ECMWF reforec=
ast
guidance. The moderate risk no longer includes the Mississippi Valley, wher=
e
some moderation is likely by the start of week-2 due to the troughing shift=
ing
more to the east, and increased influence from weak ridging forecast over t=
he
central CONUS.



A broader area of slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted =
for
much of the east-central CONUS through May 3, where the ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures
fall below the 15th climatological percentile and 40 deg F. The troughing a=
lso
supports the development of surface low pressure along the Northeast coast,
and
increased potential for enhanced rainfall, but the reforecast tools do not
highlight any widespread areas where precipitation totals reach hazardous
thresholds, precluding a related precipitation hazard from being designated=
. A
warm front may set up across parts of the eastern Great Plains and Mississi=
ppi
Valley, as the coldest air shifts to the east, with relatively warmer
temperatures to the west. This may elevate chances for some episodes of hea=
vy
rainfall over these areas during the period, with the uncalibrated ECMWF
indicating some areas with at least a 20 percent chance 3-day precipitation
totals exceed 1-inch. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, however, do not
support these elevated probabilities, and therefore, no related hazard is
posted. However, any precipitation combined with enhanced snow melt along t=
he
Red River of the North could result in river flooding, thus a possible
flooding
hazard is posted for this area.



Anomalous warmth is predicted across the southwestern CONUS and into Texas,
with maximum temperatures generally in the upper 80s and 90s deg F, althoug=
h
some readings above 100 deg F cannot be ruled out in the hottest desert
locations. No much above normal temperature hazard is posted given these
temperatures are more typical heading into May, but it should be noted that=
 a
period of hot, dry weather could potentially exacerbate ongoing drought
conditions.



Mid-level troughing is forecast across the northeastern Pacific early in
week-2, with below normal temperatures favored across the northwestern CONU=
S.
The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance o=
f
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the climatologica=
l
distribution and freezing (40 deg F at lower elevations and closer to the
coast) over parts of the Pacific Northwest, northern California, Northern
Great
Basin, and Northern Rockies. This supports a slight risk of much below norm=
al
temperatures over these areas at the outset of week-2. The GEFS maintains
troughing throughout week-2, which may lead to an increase in precipitation
chances along the West Coast later in the period. However, due to little
support from the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles, which show the trough weaken=
ing
by the middle of the period, no related precipitation hazard is posted, and
the
slight risk for much below normal temperatures is discontinued after Apr 30=
.



No hazards are indicated across Alaska, which is forecast to have weak
mid-level flow with slightly above normal 500-hPa heights. As a result, nea=
r
to
above normal temperatures are predicted across the state for the period as =
a
whole. These warmer temperatures could increase snowmelt across interior
Mainland Alaska, elevating flooding concerns. Later in the period, troughin=
g
over the Bering Sea may result in an increase in the southwesterly flow ove=
r
the southwest Mainland and the Aleutians favoring elevated precipitation
chances, with totals forecast to remain below hazards thresholds.

...Significant late season winter storm increasingly likely for
the Northern Plains this weekend and potentially heavy rainfall
threat to some areas farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A highly amplified pattern will prevail over the weekend into the
start of next week as a deep upper low tracks northeastward
through the Northern Plains and a strong Southeast ridge extends
an axis northward. A strong surface low forecast to be over the
Dakotas on Saturday and continue northeast thereafter, along with
the trailing front, will bring a wide variety of weather hazards -
significant snow and wind to the Northern Plains and eventually a
heavy rain threat evolving late in the weekend into early next
week over portions of the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and Mid
Mississippi Valley. By Tuesday-Wednesday, gradual progression of
the mean pattern will bring moderate upper troughing to the East,
a ridge to the Rockies/Plains, and a trough into the eastern
Pacific/West Coast. Much below normal temperatures may persist for
a while over the far northern parts of the Plains while well above
normal readings are possible over a majority of the eastern half
of the country through the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast emphasized a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z
UKMET/06Z GFS during the first half of the period, followed by
gradually increasing input of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means so that
the means had half total weight by day 7 Wednesday. Recent ECMWF
runs have generally provided the best intermediate timing for the
northern tier storm, with GFS runs consistently faster and the CMC
slow. UKMET runs have tended to be between the ECMWF and CMC but
the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted to the ECMWF, leaving the CMC more
in the slow minority. Meanwhile guidance has varied considerably
over recent days for the amplitude and timing of the trailing
upper trough that progresses through the central/eastern U.S.,
affecting the timing and waviness of the cold front trailing from
the surface low. Over the past day most guidance has been
consolidating toward greater progression than recent CMC runs. It
is possible that low pressure could evolve near New England by day
7 Wednesday depending on specifics of the eastern North America
upper trough. For the eastern Pacific/West Coast upper trough,
from late Sunday onward there is still a lot of model/ensemble
spread with respect to individual shortwaves flowing around the
trough and the eventual location of the embedded upper low. By
next Wednesday the new 12Z ECMWF/CMC brings the upper low closest
to the Pacific Northwest while the 00Z ECMWF mean kept it well to
the northwest. Prefer a compromise approach within this broad
spread until better agreement emerges.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

A strong to potentially significant storm system will likely track
over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest during the weekend. The
best potential for significant totals of snow and blowing snow
extends from northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana through much of
western/central North Dakota and far northwest South Dakota -
immediately west to northwest of the surface low track. The strong
winds and heavy snow combined could lead to near blizzard
conditions for some areas. There is some lingering uncertainty in
the speed and track but the gradually improving guidance cluster
suggests good confidence in a high impact late season winter storm
for portions of the region where the latest Winter Weather Outlook
shows high probabilities for at least several inches of snow.

The frontal boundary anchored by this storm will help to focus an
area of heavy rainfall from parts of the southern/central Plains
toward the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley. Southerly flow of
warm, moist air intersecting the boundary will likely lead to
strong thunderstorms that may train or repeat over the same areas
Sunday into Monday. Mesoscale convective systems repeating over
the area could lead to an axis of multi-inch totals and the latest
guidance suggests the best potential for flash flooding and
excessive rainfall from far northeastern Texas through eastern
Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and southern Missouri along with
adjacent areas. The Day 5 Experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
shows a Slight Risk over this region given the potential, as
stream flows and precipitation anomalies are already above normal
due to recent heavy rainfall and with the potential for additional
heavy rainfall leading up to Day 5. Guidance is still in the
process of resolving the timing and wave details of the surface
front so changes in the most likely coverage and magnitude of
rainfall totals are certainly possible. Lighter rainfall will
spread through the eastern U.S. during Tuesday-Wednesday as the
front accelerates.

Mostly light precipitation over the northern part of the Pacific
Northwest to start the week should expand southward through Oregon
and eastward into the northern Rockies after Monday as an upper
trough approaches the West Coast. Some pockets of moderate
activity are possible. Day-to-day details are still uncertain due
to lower confidence in specifics of shortwaves within the overall
upper trough.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
While still below normal, anomalies may finally moderate some
around midweek. The West will see more variable temperatures, with
minus 5-15F anomalies over the Intermountain West/Rockies during
the weekend followed by a west-to-east warming trend with
increasing coverage of above normal readings. Warmest highs of
10-15F above normal are likely to extend from the Great
Basin/Southwest into the central High Plains during
Tuesday-Wednesday.  At the same time clouds/precipitation ahead of
the upper trough nearing the West Coast may bring slightly below
normal highs to the Pacific Northwest. Much of the eastern half of
the country will see a significant warming trend during the
weekend and continuing into early next week over the East. Plus
10-20F anomalies should be fairly common for one or more days and
parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes could see morning lows 20-25F
above normal. One exception to the eastern warmth may be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for a while. A front meandering over
the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp contrast between cool air
to the north and warmth to the south and west, increasing the
challenge of temperature forecasting over the region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 20 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 26 - 30 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting above normal 500-
hPa
heights across most of the higher latitudes of North America, consistent wi=
th
a
transition to the negative phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). In the mea=
n
mid-level height fields, a ridge over the Aleutians and Alaska is forecast.=
 A
trough and below normal heights are across the eastern Gulf of Alaska
extending
to the northwestern CONUS. Anomalous ridging is likely farther downstream,
from
the southwestern to central CONUS. Another trough is predicted over the
northeastern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska associated with
predicted near to above normal heights. Probabilities for near to above nor=
mal
temperatures are increased across parts of the southwestern CONUS and south=
ern
and central High Plains due to relatively higher mid-level heights. Increas=
ed
probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored for the Northwest,
northern California, the northern Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great
Lakes
and much of eastern CONUS in association with forecast troughing.
Probabilities
for near to above normal temperatures are increased across the Florida
Peninsula consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is  favored for the northwestern CONUS and parts=
 of
the Northern High Plains as troughing is forecast to approach the Pacific
Northwest. Enhanced probabilities for near to below normal precipitation ar=
e
indicated for the remainder of the  CONUS during the period related to
predicted ridging, supported by the consolidated forecast tool. A slightly =
wet
pattern is likely for western Mainland Alaska in association with the surfa=
ce
southerly flow from the low pressure system over the Bering Sea.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty depicted by the temperatu=
re
and precipitation forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 28 - MAY 04, 2022

During week-2, 500-hPa troughing is favored to propagate across the eastern
CONUS, resulting in below normal heights in the manual blend over much of t=
he
eastern CONUS. An enhanced 500-hPa ridge is forecast to cross the central
CONUS. Anomalous ridging is forecast over Alaska, while a trough is predict=
ed
downstream over the Northeast Pacific and the Northwestern CONUS.

Given the predicted propagation of anomalous troughing across the eastern
CONUS, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate elevated
probabilities
for below normal temperatures across Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley,
Great
Lakes and most of the eastern CONUS, except above normal temperature
probabilities are increased over the southern Florida Peninsula. Below norm=
al
temperature probabilities are also increased over the parts of the western
CONUS and the northern Great Plains, related to the troughing over the
northeast Pacific. Both reforecast tools continue to depict increased
probabilities for above normal temperatures across the Central and Southern
Great Plains due to the ridging. Elevated probabilities for near to above
normal temperatures remain favored for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians du=
e
to
forecast ridging.

Elevated probabilities for above normal precipitation are indicated over pa=
rts
of the Northwest, Northern Great Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi
Valley along with increased potential for surface low development and front=
al
activity. Both reforecast tools support enhanced below normal precipitation
probabilities across the Great Lakes, and the eastern CONUS. Increased chan=
ces
for below normal precipitation are indicated for parts of the southwestern
CONUS and central and southern High Plains due to persistent ridging. Behin=
d
troughing over the northeast Pacific, slightly increased chances for below
normal precipitation are favored across the Alaska Panhandle. Slightly
elevated
probabilities for above normal precipitation are likely for southwestern
Mainland Alaska in association with the surface southerly flow.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated
substantial model disagreements.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO THE
OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...

Critical fire weather highlights were expanded a bit westward and
southward to reflect the latest guidance consensus in 20+ mph
sustained southwesterly winds overlapping 15 percent RH atop very
dry fuels tomorrow/Thursday afternoon. Otherwise, the previous
forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 04/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Wed Apr 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
An amplified large-scale trough and enhanced southwesterly midlevel
flow will overspread the western states, while a dryline develops
over parts of West Texas. Farther east, high pressure will continue
moving eastward across the western Atlantic waters.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Behind the dryline, breezy southwesterly surface winds will overlap
widespread 10-15 percent minimum RH. Over parts of the Texas
Panhandle, deep boundary-layer mixing into the strong southwesterly
flow aloft will favor sustained surface winds of 20-25 mph with
gusts upwards of 30 mph. These conditions, combined with very dry
fuels, will result in critical fire-weather conditions.

...Central High Plains...
While strong southerly return flow is expected over parts of the
central High Plains, confidence in the overlap of the strong surface
winds and low RH is too low to introduce highlights at this time.

...Strong upper low to bring unsettled weather to much of the
western half of the country through Friday...

...Summer-like warmth and Critical Risks of fire weather for parts
of the Front Range, Southwest and Southern Plains through
Saturday; northern tier states continue cool trend through the end
of the week...

A frontal system currently tracking through the Great Plains will
spread rain showers and thunderstorms across the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley and Midwest tonight. Some storms may be severe,
which is why the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
of severe thunderstorms for parts of eastern Oklahoma and the
western Ozarks region, where a few supercells capable of producing
hail, isolated severe gusts and a tornado are possible. Some light
rain shower activity will spread into the Lower Great Lakes and
interior Northeast tomorrow as a second system begins to emerge
from the Rockies. This new system, powered by a deep upper-level
low will strengthen as it moves into the Great Plains on Thursday.
Showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop along a warm
front ascending through parts of the Central Plains and Missouri
Valley Thursday afternoon into Thursday night, where a Slight Risk
of severe thunderstorms is in effect. Large hail and a couple of
tornadoes are possible from the storms. This rising warm front
will spread showers and thunderstorms into the Upper Midwest
Thursday night into Friday morning.

Another surface wave embedded farther upstream from the Plains
system will rapidly strengthen as it moves into the Plains on
Friday afternoon. Before this it will produce showers and
thunderstorms across the Pacific Northwest tonight. Heavy mountain
snow will develop across the Sierra and showers and scattered
thunderstorms spread into the Great Basin and Intermountain West
on Thursday, as a cold front moves through the interior West. This
system will bring another round of showers and thunderstorms to
the Great Plains and Upper Midwest by Friday afternoon, while
generating snow showers over the highest elevations of the
Northern Rockies. Severe thunderstorms are possible from the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles into southeastern South Dakota, where
the Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight Risk for Friday. Hail
and strong/damaging wind gusts will be the main concerns from any
severe weather that materializes, but severe hail may occur from
parts of the lower/middle Missouri Valley into parts of the Upper
Midwest Friday afternoon into Friday night.

Over the next few days, warm air will spread across the Plains and
southern tier states beneath an upper-level ridge. A Critical Risk
of fire weather is in effect for parts of the Southwest, Southern
Plains and Front Range tonight due to gusty winds, warm
temperatures and dry conditions. Highs will be 15-20 degrees above
average for parts of the Front Range and Texas/Oklahoma panhandle
on Thursday. Temperatures will be summer-like over parts of the
Central Plains on Friday with highs likely to be between 20-30
degrees above average. The ridge will also expand into the
Southeast on Friday which will allow for the spreading of warm air
into the East through the weekend. Cold air will persist across
the northern tier states over the next few days.

...Significant late season winter storm increasingly likely for
the Northern Plains this weekend and potentially heavy rainfall
threat to some areas farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A highly amplified pattern will prevail over the weekend into the
start of next week as a deep upper low tracks northeastward
through the Northern Plains and a strong Southeast ridge extends
an axis northward. A strong surface low forecast to be over the
Dakotas on Saturday and continue northeast thereafter, along with
the trailing front, will bring a wide variety of weather hazards -
significant snow and wind to the Northern Plains and eventually a
heavy rain threat evolving late in the weekend into early next
week over portions of the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and Mid
Mississippi Valley. By Tuesday-Wednesday, gradual progression of
the mean pattern will bring moderate upper troughing to the East,
a ridge to the Rockies/Plains, and a trough into the eastern
Pacific/West Coast. Much below normal temperatures may persist for
a while over the far northern parts of the Plains while well above
normal readings are possible over a majority of the eastern half
of the country through the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast emphasized a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z
UKMET/06Z GFS during the first half of the period, followed by
gradually increasing input of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means so that
the means had half total weight by day 7 Wednesday. Recent ECMWF
runs have generally provided the best intermediate timing for the
northern tier storm, with GFS runs consistently faster and the CMC
slow. UKMET runs have tended to be between the ECMWF and CMC but
the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted to the ECMWF, leaving the CMC more
in the slow minority. Meanwhile guidance has varied considerably
over recent days for the amplitude and timing of the trailing
upper trough that progresses through the central/eastern U.S.,
affecting the timing and waviness of the cold front trailing from
the surface low. Over the past day most guidance has been
consolidating toward greater progression than recent CMC runs. It
is possible that low pressure could evolve near New England by day
7 Wednesday depending on specifics of the eastern North America
upper trough. For the eastern Pacific/West Coast upper trough,
from late Sunday onward there is still a lot of model/ensemble
spread with respect to individual shortwaves flowing around the
trough and the eventual location of the embedded upper low. By
next Wednesday the new 12Z ECMWF/CMC brings the upper low closest
to the Pacific Northwest while the 00Z ECMWF mean kept it well to
the northwest. Prefer a compromise approach within this broad
spread until better agreement emerges.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

A strong to potentially significant storm system will likely track
over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest during the weekend. The
best potential for significant totals of snow and blowing snow
extends from northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana through much of
western/central North Dakota and far northwest South Dakota -
immediately west to northwest of the surface low track. The strong
winds and heavy snow combined could lead to near blizzard
conditions for some areas. There is some lingering uncertainty in
the speed and track but the gradually improving guidance cluster
suggests good confidence in a high impact late season winter storm
for portions of the region where the latest Winter Weather Outlook
shows high probabilities for at least several inches of snow.

The frontal boundary anchored by this storm will help to focus an
area of heavy rainfall from parts of the southern/central Plains
toward the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley. Southerly flow of
warm, moist air intersecting the boundary will likely lead to
strong thunderstorms that may train or repeat over the same areas
Sunday into Monday. Mesoscale convective systems repeating over
the area could lead to an axis of multi-inch totals and the latest
guidance suggests the best potential for flash flooding and
excessive rainfall from far northeastern Texas through eastern
Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and southern Missouri along with
adjacent areas. The Day 5 Experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
shows a Slight Risk over this region given the potential, as
stream flows and precipitation anomalies are already above normal
due to recent heavy rainfall and with the potential for additional
heavy rainfall leading up to Day 5. Guidance is still in the
process of resolving the timing and wave details of the surface
front so changes in the most likely coverage and magnitude of
rainfall totals are certainly possible. Lighter rainfall will
spread through the eastern U.S. during Tuesday-Wednesday as the
front accelerates.

Mostly light precipitation over the northern part of the Pacific
Northwest to start the week should expand southward through Oregon
and eastward into the northern Rockies after Monday as an upper
trough approaches the West Coast. Some pockets of moderate
activity are possible. Day-to-day details are still uncertain due
to lower confidence in specifics of shortwaves within the overall
upper trough.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
While still below normal, anomalies may finally moderate some
around midweek. The West will see more variable temperatures, with
minus 5-15F anomalies over the Intermountain West/Rockies during
the weekend followed by a west-to-east warming trend with
increasing coverage of above normal readings. Warmest highs of
10-15F above normal are likely to extend from the Great
Basin/Southwest into the central High Plains during
Tuesday-Wednesday.  At the same time clouds/precipitation ahead of
the upper trough nearing the West Coast may bring slightly below
normal highs to the Pacific Northwest. Much of the eastern half of
the country will see a significant warming trend during the
weekend and continuing into early next week over the East. Plus
10-20F anomalies should be fairly common for one or more days and
parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes could see morning lows 20-25F
above normal. One exception to the eastern warmth may be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for a while. A front meandering over
the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp contrast between cool air
to the north and warmth to the south and west, increasing the
challenge of temperature forecasting over the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
429 PM EDT Wed Apr 20 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 23 2022 - 12Z Wed Apr 27 2022

...Significant late season winter storm increasingly likely for
the Northern Plains this weekend and potentially heavy rainfall
threat to some areas farther south...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A highly amplified pattern will prevail over the weekend into the
start of next week as a deep upper low tracks northeastward
through the Northern Plains and a strong Southeast ridge extends
an axis northward. A strong surface low forecast to be over the
Dakotas on Saturday and continue northeast thereafter, along with
the trailing front, will bring a wide variety of weather hazards -
significant snow and wind to the Northern Plains and eventually a
heavy rain threat evolving late in the weekend into early next
week over portions of the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and Mid
Mississippi Valley. By Tuesday-Wednesday, gradual progression of
the mean pattern will bring moderate upper troughing to the East,
a ridge to the Rockies/Plains, and a trough into the eastern
Pacific/West Coast. Much below normal temperatures may persist for
a while over the far northern parts of the Plains while well above
normal readings are possible over a majority of the eastern half
of the country through the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The updated forecast emphasized a blend of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z
UKMET/06Z GFS during the first half of the period, followed by
gradually increasing input of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means so that
the means had half total weight by day 7 Wednesday. Recent ECMWF
runs have generally provided the best intermediate timing for the
northern tier storm, with GFS runs consistently faster and the CMC
slow. UKMET runs have tended to be between the ECMWF and CMC but
the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted to the ECMWF, leaving the CMC more
in the slow minority. Meanwhile guidance has varied considerably
over recent days for the amplitude and timing of the trailing
upper trough that progresses through the central/eastern U.S.,
affecting the timing and waviness of the cold front trailing from
the surface low. Over the past day most guidance has been
consolidating toward greater progression than recent CMC runs. It
is possible that low pressure could evolve near New England by day
7 Wednesday depending on specifics of the eastern North America
upper trough. For the eastern Pacific/West Coast upper trough,
from late Sunday onward there is still a lot of model/ensemble
spread with respect to individual shortwaves flowing around the
trough and the eventual location of the embedded upper low. By
next Wednesday the new 12Z ECMWF/CMC brings the upper low closest
to the Pacific Northwest while the 00Z ECMWF mean kept it well to
the northwest. Prefer a compromise approach within this broad
spread until better agreement emerges.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

A strong to potentially significant storm system will likely track
over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest during the weekend. The
best potential for significant totals of snow and blowing snow
extends from northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana through much of
western/central North Dakota and far northwest South Dakota -
immediately west to northwest of the surface low track. The strong
winds and heavy snow combined could lead to near blizzard
conditions for some areas. There is some lingering uncertainty in
the speed and track but the gradually improving guidance cluster
suggests good confidence in a high impact late season winter storm
for portions of the region where the latest Winter Weather Outlook
shows high probabilities for at least several inches of snow.

The frontal boundary anchored by this storm will help to focus an
area of heavy rainfall from parts of the southern/central Plains
toward the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley. Southerly flow of
warm, moist air intersecting the boundary will likely lead to
strong thunderstorms that may train or repeat over the same areas
Sunday into Monday. Mesoscale convective systems repeating over
the area could lead to an axis of multi-inch totals and the latest
guidance suggests the best potential for flash flooding and
excessive rainfall from far northeastern Texas through eastern
Oklahoma, northwestern Arkansas, and southern Missouri along with
adjacent areas. The Day 5 Experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
shows a Slight Risk over this region given the potential, as
stream flows and precipitation anomalies are already above normal
due to recent heavy rainfall and with the potential for additional
heavy rainfall leading up to Day 5. Guidance is still in the
process of resolving the timing and wave details of the surface
front so changes in the most likely coverage and magnitude of
rainfall totals are certainly possible. Lighter rainfall will
spread through the eastern U.S. during Tuesday-Wednesday as the
front accelerates.

Mostly light precipitation over the northern part of the Pacific
Northwest to start the week should expand southward through Oregon
and eastward into the northern Rockies after Monday as an upper
trough approaches the West Coast. Some pockets of moderate
activity are possible. Day-to-day details are still uncertain due
to lower confidence in specifics of shortwaves within the overall
upper trough.

Expect unseasonably cold temperatures to persist over far northern
parts of the Plains through the period with North Dakota in
particular seeing highs 15-30F below normal for multiple days.
While still below normal, anomalies may finally moderate some
around midweek. The West will see more variable temperatures, with
minus 5-15F anomalies over the Intermountain West/Rockies during
the weekend followed by a west-to-east warming trend with
increasing coverage of above normal readings. Warmest highs of
10-15F above normal are likely to extend from the Great
Basin/Southwest into the central High Plains during
Tuesday-Wednesday.  At the same time clouds/precipitation ahead of
the upper trough nearing the West Coast may bring slightly below
normal highs to the Pacific Northwest. Much of the eastern half of
the country will see a significant warming trend during the
weekend and continuing into early next week over the East. Plus
10-20F anomalies should be fairly common for one or more days and
parts of the Midwest/Great Lakes could see morning lows 20-25F
above normal. One exception to the eastern warmth may be over the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic where cool surface high
pressure/ridging may prevail for a while. A front meandering over
the Mid-Atlantic could provide a sharp contrast between cool air
to the north and warmth to the south and west, increasing the
challenge of temperature forecasting over the region.

...Significant late season winter storm this weekend along with
potentially heavy rainfall over portions of the Southern Plains
and Mid-MS River Valley...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An amplified flow pattern is expected to start the period as the
Northern Plains deep low lifts into Canada while a strong
Southeast ridge extends northward through much of the eastern
U.S.. The associated trailing cold front southward could bring a
localized heavy rainfall threat Sunday into Monday over portions
of the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley.
By Tuesday-Wednesday, gradual progression of the mean pattern will
bring moderate upper troughing to the East, a ridge to the
Rockies/Plains, and a trough into the eastern Pacific/West Coast.
Much below normal temperatures may persist for a while over the
far northern parts of the Plains while well above normal readings
are possible over a majority of the eastern half of the country
through the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

This forecast cycle the model agreement remains fairly clustered
and agreeable aside from the CMC and to some degree the UKMET
which were slower with the progression of the trough axis moving
from the northern tier toward the Northeast. The ECMWF continued
to be the best proxy through the period as the GFS was on the
faster side of the model spread but overall the GFS/ECMWF show
fairly good agreement through much of the forecast period such
that higher weights of the two were included in the forecast blend
this cycle. How the northeast closed low evolves mid to late week
is still uncertain and the timing of the next system in the
Northwest has continued uncertainty but through day 6-7, the
deterministic runs offered enough value to be considered. To
maintain some continuity, the ECENS/GEFS means were included days
5-7.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The strong/significant winter storm affecting the Northern Plains
will be continuing at the start of the medium range with the
surface low likely to be centered across northern Minnesota. Wrap
around precipitation underneath the closed low will likely
continue snow showers and with a strong/tight pressure gradient,
strong winds will likely continue blowing snow and reduced
visibility at times. Conditions improve by early next week as the
low weakens more into southern Canada. Meanwhile, further south,
the trailing cold front slows and stalls over portions of the
Southern Plains to Mid-Mississippi River Valley. Southerly flow
ahead of it will draw up warm, moist air that intersects the
boundary. An increasing low level jet Sunday night into Monday
morning should focus a few mesoscale convective systems that have
the potential to train and repeat over the same areas. The latest
forecast guidance suggests potential for multi-inch totals during
the Day 4 period (ending 12Z Monday April 25) across an area from
northeastern Texas through eastern Oklahoma, western/northwest
Arkansas into southern/southwest Missouri. The Day 4 Excessive
Rainfall Outlook Slight Risk was maintained this cycle with minor
adjustments based on the latest model trends which showed a nudge
to the south/southeast for the heavy rain axis. Stream flows and
precipitation anomalies are above normal for much of the Slight
Risk area due to recent heavy rainfall and there is potential for
additional rainfall leading up to Day 4. Guidance is still in the
process of resolving the timing and wave details of the surface
front so changes in the most likely coverage and magnitude of
rainfall totals are certainly possible. The front then begins to
accelerate with a progressive and amplified trough axis swinging
through - this will spread lighter rainfall across much of the
eastern U.S. during the Tuesday through Wednesday period.
Generally unsettled weather but light precipitation will spread
across the northern portions of the Pacific Northwest next week as
a series of shortwaves move through the flow underneath a closed
upper low positioned off British Columbia. Timing and specific
details are still uncertain in the lower confidence weather
pattern but overall several opportunities for precipitation though
at this time nothing looks too significant.

The weekend storm system will bring both much above normal and
much below normal temperatures to portions of the CONUS Sunday
through the middle of next week. Ahead of the system, expect
seasonably warm temperatures across the eastern U.S., especially
Sunday high temperatures across the eastern Great Lakes where
highs could top 20 degrees above normal. Warm temperatures
continue Monday but to a lesser degree. The exception to the
eastern warmth is for the coastal Northeast areas and perhaps into
the Mid-Atlantic where surface high pressure present may keep
temperatures on the cooler side. A front meandering to the south
could lead to a sharp contrast between cool air to the north and
warmth to the south and west, increasing the challenge of
temperatures forecasting over the region. The West will see more
variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F anomalies over the
Intermountain West/Rockies late in the weekend followed by a
west-to-east warming trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings. Warmest highs of 10-15F above normal are likely
to extend from the Great Basin/Southwest into the central High
Plains during Tuesday-Wednesday.  At the same time
clouds/precipitation ahead of the upper trough nearing the West
Coast may bring slightly below normal highs to the Pacific
Northwest.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
231 AM EDT Thu Apr 21 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 24 2022 - 12Z Thu Apr 28 2022

...Significant late season winter storm this weekend along with
potentially heavy rainfall over portions of the Southern Plains
and Mid-MS River Valley...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An amplified flow pattern is expected to start the period as the
Northern Plains deep low lifts into Canada while a strong
Southeast ridge extends northward through much of the eastern
U.S.. The associated trailing cold front southward could bring a
localized heavy rainfall threat Sunday into Monday over portions
of the Southern Plains to the Ozarks and Mid Mississippi Valley.
By Tuesday-Wednesday, gradual progression of the mean pattern will
bring moderate upper troughing to the East, a ridge to the
Rockies/Plains, and a trough into the eastern Pacific/West Coast.
Much below normal temperatures may persist for a while over the
far northern parts of the Plains while well above normal readings
are possible over a majority of the eastern half of the country
through the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

This forecast cycle the model agreement remains fairly clustered
and agreeable aside from the CMC and to some degree the UKMET
which were slower with the progression of the trough axis moving
from the northern tier toward the Northeast. The ECMWF continued
to be the best proxy through the period as the GFS was on the
faster side of the model spread but overall the GFS/ECMWF show
fairly good agreement through much of the forecast period such
that higher weights of the two were included in the forecast blend
this cycle. How the northeast closed low evolves mid to late week
is still uncertain and the timing of the next system in the
Northwest has continued uncertainty but through day 6-7, the
deterministic runs offered enough value to be considered. To
maintain some continuity, the ECENS/GEFS means were included days
5-7.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The strong/significant winter storm affecting the Northern Plains
will be continuing at the start of the medium range with the
surface low likely to be centered across northern Minnesota. Wrap
around precipitation underneath the closed low will likely
continue snow showers and with a strong/tight pressure gradient,
strong winds will likely continue blowing snow and reduced
visibility at times. Conditions improve by early next week as the
low weakens more into southern Canada. Meanwhile, further south,
the trailing cold front slows and stalls over portions of the
Southern Plains to Mid-Mississippi River Valley. Southerly flow
ahead of it will draw up warm, moist air that intersects the
boundary. An increasing low level jet Sunday night into Monday
morning should focus a few mesoscale convective systems that have
the potential to train and repeat over the same areas. The latest
forecast guidance suggests potential for multi-inch totals during
the Day 4 period (ending 12Z Monday April 25) across an area from
northeastern Texas through eastern Oklahoma, western/northwest
Arkansas into southern/southwest Missouri. The Day 4 Excessive
Rainfall Outlook Slight Risk was maintained this cycle with minor
adjustments based on the latest model trends which showed a nudge
to the south/southeast for the heavy rain axis. Stream flows and
precipitation anomalies are above normal for much of the Slight
Risk area due to recent heavy rainfall and there is potential for
additional rainfall leading up to Day 4. Guidance is still in the
process of resolving the timing and wave details of the surface
front so changes in the most likely coverage and magnitude of
rainfall totals are certainly possible. The front then begins to
accelerate with a progressive and amplified trough axis swinging
through - this will spread lighter rainfall across much of the
eastern U.S. during the Tuesday through Wednesday period.
Generally unsettled weather but light precipitation will spread
across the northern portions of the Pacific Northwest next week as
a series of shortwaves move through the flow underneath a closed
upper low positioned off British Columbia. Timing and specific
details are still uncertain in the lower confidence weather
pattern but overall several opportunities for precipitation though
at this time nothing looks too significant.

The weekend storm system will bring both much above normal and
much below normal temperatures to portions of the CONUS Sunday
through the middle of next week. Ahead of the system, expect
seasonably warm temperatures across the eastern U.S., especially
Sunday high temperatures across the eastern Great Lakes where
highs could top 20 degrees above normal. Warm temperatures
continue Monday but to a lesser degree. The exception to the
eastern warmth is for the coastal Northeast areas and perhaps into
the Mid-Atlantic where surface high pressure present may keep
temperatures on the cooler side. A front meandering to the south
could lead to a sharp contrast between cool air to the north and
warmth to the south and west, increasing the challenge of
temperatures forecasting over the region. The West will see more
variable temperatures, with minus 5-15F anomalies over the
Intermountain West/Rockies late in the weekend followed by a
west-to-east warming trend with increasing coverage of above
normal readings. Warmest highs of 10-15F above normal are likely
to extend from the Great Basin/Southwest into the central High
Plains during Tuesday-Wednesday.  At the same time
clouds/precipitation ahead of the upper trough nearing the West
Coast may bring slightly below normal highs to the Pacific
Northwest.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO THE
OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough will move ashore over the West Coast, while
broad west-southwesterly flow overspreads the Rockies. This will
encourage the development of a dryline over the eastern TX Panhandle
southward into northwest TX. Farther north, stronger downslope flow
will result in a deepening surface low over parts of WY, with a
corresponding tight pressure gradient developing over the central
High Plains.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Widespread 10-15 percent minimum RH will develop across the
Southwest into the southern High Plains, where breezy southwesterly
surface winds are expected. From eastern NM into the OK/TX
Panhandles, deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced flow aloft
will favor 5-10 percent RH amid 20-25 mph sustained southwesterly
surface winds behind the dryline. The combination of strong surface
winds and warm/dry boundary-layer conditions atop highly receptive
fuels will support a critical fire-weather threat.

...Central High Plains...
In response to the tightening surface pressure gradient, strong
southerly surface winds of 25+ mph will overspread parts of the
central High Plains (including portions of northeastern CO, western
NE, and southeastern WY). While RH should generally remain above 30
percent owing to increasing moisture return, the strong/gusty
surface winds coupled with critically dry fuels could support at
least locally elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon.

...Florida Peninsula...
Breezy easterly surface winds near 15 mph will persist over the
Florida Peninsula. While minimum RH could fall to near 35 percent
over the western portion of the peninsula, a minimal overlap of the
breezy surface winds and low RH precludes highlights at this time.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND
EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO EASTERN COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
***OUTBREAK OF DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON FRIDAY
ACROSS PORTIONS OF EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO EASTERN COLORADO***

A highly amplified large-scale trough and accompanying intense
deep-layer south-southwesterly flow will emerge over the southern
Rockies and adjacent High Plains by peak heating. As a result,
strong cyclogenesis will occur over far northeastern Colorado, with
a sharpening dryline extending southward along the Kansas/Colorado
border and the Texas/New Mexico border. The combination of a tight
surface pressure gradient, hot/dry conditions behind the dryline,
and deep/powerful south-southwesterly flow will result in extremely
critical fire-weather conditions from east-central New Mexico into
eastern Colorado on Day 2/Friday.

...East-central New Mexico into eastern Colorado...
As temperatures climb into the upper 70s to middle 80s behind the
sharpening dryline, deep boundary-layer mixing into very dry air
aloft will result in widespread 5-15 percent minimum RH. At the same
time, 30-40 mph sustained south-southwesterly surface winds (with
gusts upwards of 50-60 mph) will overspread critically dry fuels
(ERCs in the 90th+ percentile). The volatile combination of very
strong/gusty winds, anomalously warm/dry conditions, and near-record
dry fuels will encourage extreme fire-weather conditions.

...Remainder of the central and southern High Plains...
The eastern extent of critical fire-weather conditions will be
demarcated by the placement of the dryline, which is somewhat
unclear at this time. Regardless, strong 30+ mph sustained southerly
surface winds (with higher gusts) will extend into the western
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, western Kansas, and western Nebraska --
where fuels remain critically dry.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0953 AM CST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track based on morning observations and
trends in latest guidance. While hi-res solutions have trended
towards higher RH across the northern High Plains, periods of
elevated fire weather conditions remain possible across central MT.
Seasonally high ERC values are noted for a couple of zones across
central MT, but fuels across the broader region remain unreceptive
and preclude a greater fire weather risk.

Across coastal CA, winds remain breezy with occasional gusts up to
50 mph, but the LAX-TPH pressure gradient has begun weakening and
will continue to do so through the day, diminishing gradient winds
in the process.

..Moore.. 01/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1139 PM CST Sat Jan 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
For today, a closed upper low will continue eastward in the
Southwest, becoming more of an open wave with time. Elsewhere, a
broad upper trough will be situated across the eastern third of the
country. A fast-moving shortwave trough will dive southeastward out
of Canada and into the northern Plains. A surface cyclone will
follow a similar path out of the Canadian Prairie. A surface high
pressure system will remain in the Great Basin, but is expected to
weaken through the period.

Two areas of strong winds and lowered RH are possible. Offshore
winds will continue for part of the day in southern California. Some
of the more aggressively dry guidance shows near-critical RH
occurring in parts of central Montana along with fairly strong
winds. Even with the potential for elevated/near-critical
meteorological conditions, fuels have received enough recent
precipitation that fire weather concerns should remain low in both
areas.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
127 PM EST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022

18Z Update: The 12Z model guidance suite is in above average
agreement through next week on the overall synoptic scale pattern.
 At the time of product issuance, the 00Z UKMET differed across
British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest by Wednesday with
placement of the upper ridge axis by late Thursday.  The 12Z GFS
is a bit more amplified with the trough digging southward across
the southern Plains for the middle-end of the week, but it fits
the overall pattern and has ensemble support.  Overall, the past
few runs of the GFS have depicted a much more realistic scenario
across the East Coast region for next weekend, compared to
yesterday's 18Z GFS that had a massive blizzard hammering the East
Coast region.  The WPC forecast and model consensus supports the
idea of a strong surface low developing well offshore on Saturday
and then lifting northeastward towards Newfoundland, but it
appears the majority of the high winds and heavy precipitation
should remain offshore.  There is still plenty of time to monitor
future trends with this storm system.  A multi-deterministic blend
was incorporated for the WPC forecast for most of the forecast
period, with some contributions from the GEFS and ECENS means for
next weekend.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below
for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means generally agree upon the idea of broad
mean troughing aloft over much of the lower 48 as of Wednesday
transitioning more to the eastern half of the country as a mean
ridge over the eastern Pacific moves into the western U.S.  Best
consensus of guidance has a Pacific shortwave briefly suppressing
the western ridge around Saturday followed by a rebound of the
ridge, ahead of troughing over the far northeastern Pacific.  The
strongest system of the period will likely be low pressure
expected to develop over the western Atlantic around the end of
the week through the weekend, in response to a strong shortwave
trough approaching and crossing the East Coast.  Details remain
too uncertain to resolve exactly what the system's effects will be
over the East.  Farther west, a couple clipper systems with fairly
light precipitation will track over the northern tier while the
late week/weekend pattern should bring at least a modest increase
of moisture to the Northwest.  For temperatures the East will be
below normal most of the period while much of the West through
portions of the Plains will be above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within the fairly agreeable mean pattern, the most prominent
forecast uncertainties have been with the eastern Pacific/western
U.S. evolution as shortwave energy approaches the upper ridge that
reaches the West along with expected western Atlantic development
as an amplified trough reaches the East late in the week.  Model
and ensemble spread remains considerable for the Pacific/West
area, with recent GFS runs and 12Z CMC holding onto a stronger
ridge versus the past couple ECMWF runs.  However the 18Z and new
00Z GFS runs have adjusted much closer to the 12Z ECMWF and the
ensemble means.  The 00Z CMC has also trended toward this
improving cluster.  This leaves the 00Z UKMET that diverges from
most other guidance for various aspects of the eastern
Pacific/northwestern North American pattern.  Perhaps with the aid
of this better western agreement, the 00Z models have trended
somewhat closer for the late week/weekend Atlantic development.
In particular the 00Z GFS has gone away from the 12Z/18Z runs
whose slower/sharper/elongated upper trough had produced a farther
southwest storm than a great majority of GEFS/ECMWF/CMC ensemble
members.  The 00Z GFS/CMC and latest ensemble means are now
similar in showing low pressure somewhat east of the Mid-Atlantic
coast early Saturday and then tracking into or south of the
Canadian Maritimes by early Sunday.  The supporting shortwave
energy is currently over the North Pacific and is not scheduled to
round the East Pacific ridge until around Tuesday, plus guidance
is still varying with the western ridge/Pacific energy heading
into it, so it will likely take a while to gain much more
confidence in a particular scenario.

The forecast has been fairly consistent in concept for two
fronts/waves expected to drop into the northern tier during the
period, the first around Thursday and another during the weekend.
There are still some typical detail differences and run-to-run
adjustments that are best resolved by a blend approach.
Models/means show better than average agreement for the upper
troughing and surface system over the northeastern Pacific by the
end of the period.

An early period 12Z/18Z model blend trended toward 50-60 percent
total weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by days 6-7
Saturday-Sunday to reflect the consistent and intermediate
solution for Atlantic development in the means (minimizing 12Z/18Z
GFS influence) and to account for ongoing uncertainty with details
over the West late week into the weekend.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A mid-late week wave/frontal system should spread an area of
mostly light snow across parts of the northern Plains and Great
Lakes/Northeast, followed by another system also accompanied by
mostly light snow next weekend.  The southern High Plains may see
a little light precipitation Wednesday.  Confidence is still not
great for exactly how late week/weekend Atlantic storm development
will affect areas near the East Coast.  The most likely evolution
would lead to some potential for snow and brisk to strong winds
over New England with lesser probability for significant effects
farther south.  Typical guidance errors at this time frame still
allow for significant changes to the current forecast.
Approaching Pacific shortwave energy and then flow ahead of a
developing northeastern Pacific upper trough may bring light to
locally moderate rain and mountain snow into the Pacific Northwest
during Friday-Sunday, with a little snow possibly extending into
the northern Rockies.

Within the chilly pattern over the eastern half of the country,
coldest anomalies should extend from the Midwest/Upper Mississippi
Valley through the Great Lakes Wednesday into early Thursday with
readings 15-25F below normal and locally colder in parts of the
Midwest early Wednesday.  Somewhat less extreme cold anomalies
will spread through the southern Plains/South and the East during
that time.  Reinforcing cold air should lead to decent coverage of
5-15F below normal temperatures over the East next weekend.
Mostly above normal readings will prevail from the West through
the northern half of the Plains.  Some scattered plus 10-15F
anomalies will be possible over and near the Great Basin and the
northern Plains should have one or more days 10-20F above normal.
Some of the positive anomalies should reach into the southern
Plains by the weekend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
127 PM EST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 26 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022

18Z Update: The 12Z model guidance suite is in above average
agreement through next week on the overall synoptic scale pattern.
 At the time of product issuance, the 00Z UKMET differed across
British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest by Wednesday with
placement of the upper ridge axis by late Thursday.  The 12Z GFS
is a bit more amplified with the trough digging southward across
the southern Plains for the middle-end of the week, but it fits
the overall pattern and has ensemble support.  Overall, the past
few runs of the GFS have depicted a much more realistic scenario
across the East Coast region for next weekend, compared to
yesterday's 18Z GFS that had a massive blizzard hammering the East
Coast region.  The WPC forecast and model consensus supports the
idea of a strong surface low developing well offshore on Saturday
and then lifting northeastward towards Newfoundland, but it
appears the majority of the high winds and heavy precipitation
should remain offshore.  There is still plenty of time to monitor
future trends with this storm system.  A multi-deterministic blend
was incorporated for the WPC forecast for most of the forecast
period, with some contributions from the GEFS and ECENS means for
next weekend.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below
for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means generally agree upon the idea of broad
mean troughing aloft over much of the lower 48 as of Wednesday
transitioning more to the eastern half of the country as a mean
ridge over the eastern Pacific moves into the western U.S.  Best
consensus of guidance has a Pacific shortwave briefly suppressing
the western ridge around Saturday followed by a rebound of the
ridge, ahead of troughing over the far northeastern Pacific.  The
strongest system of the period will likely be low pressure
expected to develop over the western Atlantic around the end of
the week through the weekend, in response to a strong shortwave
trough approaching and crossing the East Coast.  Details remain
too uncertain to resolve exactly what the system's effects will be
over the East.  Farther west, a couple clipper systems with fairly
light precipitation will track over the northern tier while the
late week/weekend pattern should bring at least a modest increase
of moisture to the Northwest.  For temperatures the East will be
below normal most of the period while much of the West through
portions of the Plains will be above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within the fairly agreeable mean pattern, the most prominent
forecast uncertainties have been with the eastern Pacific/western
U.S. evolution as shortwave energy approaches the upper ridge that
reaches the West along with expected western Atlantic development
as an amplified trough reaches the East late in the week.  Model
and ensemble spread remains considerable for the Pacific/West
area, with recent GFS runs and 12Z CMC holding onto a stronger
ridge versus the past couple ECMWF runs.  However the 18Z and new
00Z GFS runs have adjusted much closer to the 12Z ECMWF and the
ensemble means.  The 00Z CMC has also trended toward this
improving cluster.  This leaves the 00Z UKMET that diverges from
most other guidance for various aspects of the eastern
Pacific/northwestern North American pattern.  Perhaps with the aid
of this better western agreement, the 00Z models have trended
somewhat closer for the late week/weekend Atlantic development.
In particular the 00Z GFS has gone away from the 12Z/18Z runs
whose slower/sharper/elongated upper trough had produced a farther
southwest storm than a great majority of GEFS/ECMWF/CMC ensemble
members.  The 00Z GFS/CMC and latest ensemble means are now
similar in showing low pressure somewhat east of the Mid-Atlantic

Canadian Maritimes by early Sunday.  The supporting shortwave
energy is currently over the North Pacific and is not scheduled to
round the East Pacific ridge until around Tuesday, plus guidance

into it, so it will likely take a while to gain much more
confidence in a particular scenario.

The forecast has been fairly consistent in concept for two
fronts/waves expected to drop into the northern tier during the
period, the first around Thursday and another during the weekend.
There are still some typical detail differences and run-to-run
adjustments that are best resolved by a blend approach.
Models/means show better than average agreement for the upper
troughing and surface system over the northeastern Pacific by the
end of the period.

An early period 12Z/18Z model blend trended toward 50-60 percent
total weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by days 6-7
Saturday-Sunday to reflect the consistent and intermediate
solution for Atlantic development in the means (minimizing 12Z/18Z

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1256 PM CST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Latest ensemble guidance continues
to show the best post-frontal wind potential across the CO/KS/NE
region where cooler temperatures will moderate RH reductions.
Further south into the southern High Plains, 20-25% RH remains
likely, but winds will generally be weaker. Elevated conditions may
develop across the OK/TX Panhandles, but should be relatively brief
and localized.

..Moore.. 01/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CST Sun Jan 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level troughing will continue across eastern portions of
the CONUS on Monday. The shortwave trough in the southern High
Plains will continued shifting eastward and eventually phase with
the broader, large-scale trough in the East. In the Pacific
Northwest, another shortwave trough will move southeastward out of
western Canada, reaching the Great Basin by Tuesday morning. At the
surface, another strong cold front will move through the Plains and
upper-Midwest.

Temperatures ahead of the cold front in the southern High Plains
will likely reach the 50s F to near 60 F in some places. Dry
conditions (generally 20-25% RH) are possible just ahead of and
behind the front as cold air will lag behind a shift to northerly
winds. Fuels remain quite dry despite some improvement due to recent
cold conditions. Winds may struggle to reach 15 mph, however. Any
fire weather concerns that develop will be local and brief.

...Periods of light to moderate snow across the northern tier
states...

...Low pressure system to bring rain showers and thunderstorms to
the Gulf Coast beginning Monday...

...Moderating temperatures across much of the southern and eastern
U.S. but mild afternoons over the Northern/Central Plains will be
followed by arctic air intrusion Monday into Tuesday....

An arctic air mass that has settled across the southern and
eastern U.S. will bring another night of colder than normal
temperatures before a moderating trend sets in on Monday.
Meanwhile, a series of shortwaves diving across western Canada
will round a broad trough stationed over eastern Canada. This
pattern will result in a couple of fast-moving low pressure waves
to track across the northern tier states and Northeast over the
next couple of days, bringing periods of snow to the region
followed by the intrusion of arctic air from Canada. The first
clipper will depart into the Atlantic this evening, but will
generate light snow across parts of the Northeast, Lower Great
Lakes and Central Appalachians. The second clipper will deliver a
quick round of mainly light snow across the northern Plains to the
upper Midwest and into the Great Lakes on Monday, before reaching
New England by Tuesday morning. Lake effect enhancement should
result in somewhat higher amounts downwind of the lake waters from
both systems.

Meanwhile, a closed upper-level low is forecast to track eastward
toward southern Texas over the next couple of days and will
trigger the formation of a surface low system just off the Texas
coast Monday night.  This system will then tap into Gulf moisture
and trigger a round of showers and some thunderstorms along the
Gulf coast through Monday before moving into the Florida Peninsula
on Tuesday. The heaviest rainfall is forecast to stay just off the
coast. Another shortwave impulse will dive down the spine of the
Rockies on Monday and Tuesday. This bit of energy will trigger
snow showers from the Rockies into western Kansas with heavier
snow likely over the higher elevations.

Elsewhere, the Northern/Central Plains will warm up considerably
today before the second clipper system tracks into the Northern
Plains tonight. The arctic front in the wake of the second clipper
will plunge into the Plains with much colder temperatures surging
south Monday night into Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun January 23 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 PM CST Sun Jan 23 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A weak lee surface low is expected to develop in the southern High
Plains ahead of an approaching cold front today. Though winds will
shift to northward across the region in the early afternoon, colder
air will lag behind. Modest RH reductions to 20-25% in some parts of
the combined Panhandles are possible just ahead and behind the
front. Maximum sustained winds of around 15 mph are expected. Fire
weather concerns may briefly become elevated on a local basis, but
potential for widespread concerns remains low.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 AM CST Mon Jan 24 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the upper Midwest and Northeast will
intensify on Tuesday. In the West, a shortwave trough will move
southeastward from the Great Basin into the Southwest. The
intensifying trough in the East will help push a stronger surface
high pressure system into the Plains. High pressure will similarly
strengthen in the northern Rockies/Great Basin in the wake of the
shortwave trough. Colder temperatures and precipitation will
generally keep fire weather concerns minimal for most of the CONUS.
Dry conditions and breezy northerly/northeasterly winds are possible
in parts of southern California and the lower Colorado River Basin.
However, fuels in these locations are not currently receptive to
fire spread.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Mon Jan 24 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Jan 27 2022 - 12Z Mon Jan 31 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show a mean upper level pattern that
features troughing over the East, varying degrees of ridging over
the West, and a developing northeastern Pacific trough that may
approach the West Coast early next week.  Within this fairly
agreeable regime there are still significant uncertainties
regarding specifics of an eastern U.S. amplified trough that will
likely support a western Atlantic storm Friday into the weekend
with some effects possible over New England in particular, as well
as for a shortwave approaching the West Coast late this week.
Issues near the West Coast may have some influence on the forecast
farther to the east.  There are also differences with details of
the late-period northeastern Pacific trough, affecting how much
moisture reaches the Northwest.  Between these areas of
contention, a series of weak systems may bring light precipitation
to some areas from the northern tier into the Appalachians.  The
forecast temperature pattern remains similar with the East
generally below normal through the weekend and the West into
portions of the Plains above normal for most days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Even though the large scale mean pattern has been rather
consistent in the guidance, the embedded areas of uncertainty
involve aspects that are smaller in scale and lead to lower
predictability.

Over recent days, most operational models have been varying with
the exact depiction of shortwave energy within the amplified upper
trough that heads into the East and supports Atlantic cyclogenesis
late week into the weekend--thus leading to important differences
in track/timing/strength of the surface system.  One positive
trend is a deeper depiction in the ensemble means compared to
previous days, suggesting that member spread may be decreasing
somewhat.  However there is still enough track variance among the
guidance to result in a wide variety of potential effects,
especially over New England and to a lesser extent farther south.
On one hand the recent CMC runs and associated ensembles have
tended to be on the northern/northwestern side of the full
guidance spread and the new 00Z run actually brings the track into
New England.  On the other extreme the 12Z ECMWF was so far east
that it brought hardly any precipitation at all to New England.
Remaining solutions are between these extremes with the consensus
trend among 12Z/18Z and new 00Z guidance appearing to be somewhat
westward.  An intermediate approach provides the best stability
for the time being.  A major change in the new 00Z ECMWF
highlights the sensitivity of the forecast, as it now shows a very
deep low just off New England by late Saturday--a little north of
a similarly wound-up UKMET.

Guidance also continues to have difficulty with the details of
shortwave energy approaching the West Coast late this week and
then filtering through the western mean ridge.  Latest
GFS/UKMET/CMC runs have been suggesting the potential for an upper
low to close off while recent ECMWF runs and the ensemble means
have kept it as an open wave.  The new 12Z ECMWF has trended more
to the other models in principle.  These differences first affect
the coverage and amounts of precipitation near the West Coast.
Then the varied handling of this energy leads to various ideas for
how much precipitation may develop over the southern
Plains/western half of the Gulf Coast late in the period.  For the
purposes of a single deterministic forecast, prefer to maintain
the open wave depiction for better continuity but with fairly low
confidence.

Elsewhere, there is decent model/mean consensus for the developing
northeastern Pacific trough but its evolution has some complexity
involving multiple features, so details may take a while to
resolve better.  This favors a model/mean blend for the time
being.  An initial front should be dropping into the northern tier
by Thursday followed by a wave tracking from the northern Plains
through the Midwest and Great Lakes Saturday-Monday.  Spread and
run-to-run variability have been fairly typical thus far, with
some gradual detail adjustments in consecutive consensus blends.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z model runs
early in the period and then started to incorporate 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means by day 5 Saturday, reaching 50 percent total weight by
days 6-7 Sunday-Monday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Continue to monitor forecasts for the likely Atlantic storm
development late this week and weekend.  Recent trends are
increasing the potential that New England could see meaningful
precipitation and wind effects from this system.  With lesser
magnitudes of each, there is also uncertainty for what portions of
the Mid-Atlantic may experience.  Typical guidance errors for such
systems at this time frame still allow for significant changes to
the current forecast.  It is hoped that arrival of some of the
supporting dynamics into western Canada by Tuesday may start to
provide improved refinement to the forecast around then or shortly
thereafter.  Before this storm develops, locations across the far
southern tier may see some mostly light precipitation.  Some
locations near the West Coast may see an increase in precipitation
with an approaching shortwave/possible compact upper low late week
into the weekend but with low confidence in details.  This energy
could eventually support some precipitation over the southern
Plains/western half of the Gulf Coast early next week.  Flow ahead
of a northeastern Pacific upper trough should bring rain and
mountain snow into the Northwest but again with low confidence for
timing and amounts.  A wavy frontal system should bring mostly
light snow to the Great Lakes and Appalachians late this week.
One or more trailing weak waves may also produce scattered light
snow over areas from the extreme northern tier into the Great
Lakes.

On Thursday northern parts of the East will see lows 10-20F below
normal and locations near the East Coast will see highs 10F or
more below normal.  Reinforcing cold air reaching the east-central
U.S. Friday will bring a broad area of temperatures at least
10-15F below normal over the East by Saturday.  Most areas should
rebound toward more normal readings by next Monday.  Much of the
West should continue to see moderately above normal temperatures
(locally plus 10-15F anomalies) while the northern and central
Plains will likely see one or more days with temperatures 10-20F
above normal (especially Friday-Saturday).  Lesser warmth may
extend into the southern Plains by the weekend.

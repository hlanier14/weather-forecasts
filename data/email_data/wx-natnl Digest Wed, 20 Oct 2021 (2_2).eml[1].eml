...Pair of Pacific storms to bring heavy rain and mountain snow to
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest...

...Periods of rain and severe storms possible from the Midwest to
the northern Mid-Atlantic; severe storms also possible in the
Southern Plains on Thursday...

...Abnormally warm temperatures return in the East, cooler in the
Midwest and along the West Coast...

The first in a parade of Pacific storm systems to slam the West
Coast over the next 5-7 days is striking the Pacific Northwest
this morning. Rain will be the dominant precipitation type in the
valleys and coastal areas, while snow falls in the highest
elevations of the Cascades and Shastas. Precipitation should
diminish as the frontal system weakens late Wednesday into early
Thursday morning, but a second and more intense Pacific low
approaches on Thursday. The storm will direct a moisture-rich
atmospheric river at Northern California and the Pacific Northwest
on Thursday, pumping ample amounts of precipitation into these
regions. This is a welcome sight to much of the drought-stricken
and wildfire-riddled Northwest, particularly in southwest Oregon
and Northern California where the heaviest amounts are expected.
However, rainfall rates could reach excessive levels at times,
making flash flooding, rapid run off, and debris flows a concern
in burn scar areas. As a result, a Marginal Risk for Excessive
Rainfall is in place for portions of Northern California and far
southwest Oregon for both Thursday and Friday. Only the highest
elevations can expect measurable snowfall due to high snow levels
aloft.

In the Heartland, a strengthening area of low pressure tracking
into the Midwest today is sill causing snow to fall in southwest
South Dakota. Snow should taper off soon as the storm tracks east
this morning. This area of low pressure is set to produce periods
of rain in the Upper Mississippi Valley. Thunderstorms are also in
the forecast with some storms potentially becoming severe as far
east as the Great Lakes and as far south as the mid-Mississippi
Valley. A Marginal Risk for severe weather has been issued today
for northern Iowa and southern Minnesota. As the wave of low
pressure pushes east into the Great Lakes Thursday morning, so
will its swath of showers and thunderstorms. Thursday's most at
risk area for severe weather is in the eastern Great Lakes and
western Pennsylvania, but thunderstorms could even develop in the
northern Mid-Atlantic. Severe weather is also possible along a
warm front emanating out of a new disturbance forming in the
Southern Plains. Another Marginal Risk is in place for southern
Oklahoma where severe storms may develop Thursday evening.

The East witnesses the return of seasonally warmer temperatures
after experiencing more autumn-like conditions the last few days.
Widespread 70s are anticipated from the Mississippi Valley to the
Mid-Atlantic coast while the South Central U.S. sees highs soar
into the 80s. By Thursday, even parts of the Mid-Atlantic can
expect highs that approach 80 degrees but considerably warmer
conditions will be common up and down the East Coast and along the
Gulf Coast. In contrast, the persistent influence of onshore flow
from the onslaught of Pacific storm systems will generally keep
the West Coast on the cooler than normal side. In the Northern
Plains, a cold front is ushering in another shot of cooler
temperatures across the region today. This cold front makes its
way east into the Midwest and Great Lakes on Thursday, leading to
a similar cooling trend there. The cold front eventually reaches
the East Coast by Friday, allowing for a cool, crisp air-mass to
return across the Northeast for the upcoming weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN KANSAS...

Critical highlights have been introduced for parts of eastern Kansas
for the potential of rapid grassfire spread later this afternoon.
Visible satellite imagery depicts clear skies across much of the
central U.S., allowing for the rapid mixing of a very dry boundary
layer (as noted in OUN and TOP 12Z observed soundings). With the
onset of heating, surface RH has already dropped by 20-30% in
several locales over the last couple of hours, with sustained
southwesterly winds approaching 20 mph (and gusts reaching 30 mph
per latest METAR observations). The 12Z TOP sounding shows very dry
air above 850 mb, with the OUN sounding depicting this very dry air
even lower in altitude. METAR observations also depict a narrow
corridor of relatively drier surface air streaming from central
Oklahoma into eastern Kansas, and this trend is expected to continue
into the afternoon. Additional heating this afternoon may easily
encourage the drier air aloft to mix downward within this
aforementioned northward-streaming corridor, promoting near-critical
to critically low RH (close to 20%). Finer fuels are quite receptive
to wildfire spread, with grassland fire potential being high today
even if surface winds/RH end up falling just shy of Critical
criteria.

Portions of the southeast, northern Florida Panhandle, and the
Carolinas are still expected to see surface RH values under 30% in
spots. However, recent appreciable rainfall in the last week and the
lack of a stronger wind field precludes fire weather highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CST Sun Mar 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad upper-level ridging as well as a building surface high over
the central/eastern CONUS will favor mostly clear skies and limited
rain chances today. This will help support fire weather concerns for
portions of the southern and central Plains where grasses have been
drying and dry, windy conditions are expected. Conditional fire
weather threats are also noted across the Great Basin and portions
of the Carolinas where dry conditions are likely.

...Eastern Kansas and adjacent areas of Oklahoma/Missouri...
Elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions appear likely
this afternoon from northeast OK, across eastern KS, and into
northwest MO. Early morning observations show a surface trough
meandering eastward as a weakening surface low moves into Canada.
This trough should be draped meridionally across the Plains by
mid/late afternoon. To the east, a building surface high will help
strengthen the pressure gradient over the southern and central
Plains.

Sustained south/southwesterly winds upwards of 15-25 mph appear
likely by mid afternoon. Mostly clear skies will aid in diurnal
heating and boundary layer mixing, which should support wind gusts
up to 30-35 mph. Dewpoint trends across eastern KS have been slowly
declining over the past 12 hours as drier air across OK and northern
TX is advected northward within a meager southerly flow regime.
However, dry air advection will likely accelerate later today as
winds increase. This factor, coupled with favorable daytime heating,
should allow relative humidity values to fall into the 20-30% range.
Reports from the region suggest that fine grassy fuels are receptive
and should support wildfire spread. Localized critical conditions
appear possible across eastern KS, and a critical delineation may be
considered if confidence increases that RH values will fall below
20% over a broad region.

...Great Basin...
Modest surface pressure falls are forecast across the Great Basin
today as an upper-level trough, noted in early-morning water-vapor
imagery approaching the Northwest Coast, gradually moves onshore.
Low-level winds will likely increase to 15-20 mph across the region,
but limited upper-level support should preclude widespread windy
conditions.  Relative humidity in the teens and low 20s has been
common over the past few days, but fuels largely remain
non-critical. One exception to this is portions of central to
western AZ where localized elevated fire weather conditions are
possible this afternoon as RH falls into the teens once again.
However, the threat is expected to remain largely localized.

...Carolinas...
Dry conditions have been noted across the western Carolinas and
west/southwest VA where recent fuel analyses suggest 10-hour fuel
moisture values are in the 5-10% range and little precipitation has
fallen in recent days. A northwesterly, post-frontal flow regime
will remain in place for today, and upstream dewpoints in the single
digits and low teens suggest another day of dry conditions is
likely. This is supported by latest guidance, which shows reasonable
probabilities for RH less than 30%. However, wind speeds will
generally remain too weak for highlights. Nonetheless,
topographically enhanced flow east of the Carolina Piedmont may
support pockets of elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon.

...Late-week heavy rain possible from the central Plains to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley/Midwest...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to indicate that an amplified
southern stream upper trough/low will settle over the
West/Southwest this week in a pattern with above normal forecast
predictability. This trough will support rain and higher elevation
snow along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Lead
energies forecast to eject from the trough will support a quite
wavy and slow-moving central to eastern U.S. front whose Gulf
moisture and instability pooling will fuel a focus for locally
enhanced rainfall and training convection.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise
for much of the coming workweek as ridging moves in from the
central U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.  This will bring much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.
Toward the end of the week and next weekend, models generally
agree that a cold front will progressively move through the
Midwest and down through the East in response to amplified
northern stream upper trough passage whereas the trailing front
will become nearly stationary from the central/southern Plains to
the Mid-Mississippi and into the Ohio Valley, where there is ample
model signal for an axis of heavy rain to develop.  Low pressure
waves that form and track along the front would be instrumental in
producing periodic heavy rains.  However, the timing of the waves
will be difficult to resolve until we get closer to the event.  By
next weekend, model solutions begin to diverge across the
mid-section of the country as the GFS/GEFS brings the western U.S.
trough noticeably faster into the Plains than the ECMWF solutions,
whereas the CMC/CMC mean offers a faster version of the ECMWF
solutions.

support frontal low pressure systems with enhanced precipitation

and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with the return and pooling of
Gulf moisture and instability.  Some wintry weather may be
possible over northern locations.  Activity will focus near a wavy
trailing cold front that will tend to stall as upper troughing
settles over the West, possibly leading to cell training.  There

next weekend, but height falls and instability may invigorate
precipitation potential for the south-central Rockies/Plains with
deformation and terrain/upslope flow.  This includes a wintry
threat focus from the Rockies to the High Plains as lead cold air
filters southward through the central and eastern U.S.  By next
weekend, the lingering front across the Deep South should continue
to keep a good chance of precipitation in the vicinity while the
Southwest should enter a drying trend as the upper trough should
progress further east toward/into the southern Plains.

Temperature-wise, anomalous warmth across the northern Plains is
forecast to spread southeastward through the East Coast bringing
the first sign of spring into the area.  In contrast, cooler than
normal conditions will continue for much of the West before a
gradual warming trend sets in later this week from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Plains.

...Late-week heavy rain possible from the central Plains to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley/Midwest...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to indicate that an amplified
southern stream upper trough/low will settle over the
West/Southwest this week in a pattern with above normal forecast
predictability. This trough will support rain and higher elevation
snow along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Lead
energies forecast to eject from the trough will support a quite
wavy and slow-moving central to eastern U.S. front whose Gulf
moisture and instability pooling will fuel a focus for locally
enhanced rainfall and training convection.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise
for much of the coming workweek as ridging moves in from the
central U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico.  This will bring much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.
Toward the end of the week and next weekend, models generally
agree that a cold front will progressively move through the
Midwest and down through the East in response to amplified
northern stream upper trough passage whereas the trailing front
will become nearly stationary from the central/southern Plains to
the Mid-Mississippi and into the Ohio Valley, where there is ample
model signal for an axis of heavy rain to develop.  Low pressure
waves that form and track along the front would be instrumental in
producing periodic heavy rains.  However, the timing of the waves
will be difficult to resolve until we get closer to the event.  By
next weekend, model solutions begin to diverge across the
mid-section of the country as the GFS/GEFS brings the western U.S.
trough noticeably faster into the Plains than the ECMWF solutions,
whereas the CMC/CMC mean offers a faster version of the ECMWF
solutions.

The WPC medium range product suite for Days 3-5 was derived from a
composite blend of the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, the 00Z ECMWF/EC
ensemble mean, smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, as
well as the 13Z National Blend of Models.  For Days 6-7 (next
weekend), an intermediate solution based mainly on a blend of the
ensemble means with little or no contribution from the

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 PM CST Sun Mar 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Slight adjustments
were made to the central High Plains Elevated area to account for
the latest guidance consensus. Some guidance members also hint at
locally Critical conditions possible across southeast Colorado by
afternoon peak heating. While surface RH may dip to 15% in some
locales, the lack of more widespread 15% RH coinciding with 20+ mph
sustained southwesterly winds precludes Critical highlights at this
time. A Critical area may be added in future outlooks should
guidance consensus trend lower in surface RH tomorrow afternoon.

Elevated conditions are still expected across parts of the Lower
Colorado River Basin during the afternoon. Lastly, widespread 25-35%
RH will likely prevail across much of the Southeast into the Florida
Peninsula and Carolina Piedmont tomorrow. However, fire weather
highlights have been withheld since wind speeds are expected to be
light and variable.

..Squitieri.. 03/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CST Sun Mar 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, currently off the West Coast, is
forecast to translate into the Great Basin and central Rockies
through the day Sunday. Surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West and High Plains are expected, and will help
drive increasing winds across the region. Elevated fire weather
conditions are likely where dry and windy conditions can overlap
with favorably receptive fuels. To the east, surface high pressure
will limit wind speeds and minimize the fire weather potential
(despite favorably dry fuels for some locations).

...Northeast New Mexico and southeast Colorado...
Lee troughing along the High Plains will allow for strengthening
west/southwesterly flow off the higher terrain to the west. As a
result, downslope warming/drying should yield relative humidity
values in the low 20s (and perhaps teens) coincident with 15-20 mph
winds. This appears most likely across northeast NM into southeast
CO and adjacent areas of KS and the OK/TX Panhandles. While the
northern extent of elevated conditions is somewhat uncertain due to
spread in guidance, fuels across this region are fairly dry after
several days of warm, dry, and windy conditions.

...Southwest...
Pressure-gradient winds will likely increase to 20-25 mph across a
broad swath of the southern Great Basin and AZ/NM. While the
strongest winds and driest conditions are currently expected over
northern AZ under a belt of stronger mid-level flow, fuels in this
region are below critical thresholds per recent fuel guidance.
Further to the southeast, ERC values have been climbing to above
seasonal averages for southeast AZ/southwest NM. Although this
region is on the periphery of the stronger flow, sustained winds in
the 15-20 mph range remain likely and should be coincident with RH
values near 15%. As such, elevated fire weather conditions are
expected.

...Western Carolinas...
Dry conditions will persist across the Carolinas where fine fuels
have continued to cure after several days of warm/dry weather.
Relative humidity values will likely fall to near 20% as
temperatures warm under mostly clear skies. However, surface high
pressure over the region will limit wind speeds and mitigate most
fire weather concerns.

...Unsettled weather pattern from California and the Northwest to
the Northern Rockies, mostly dry across the eastern two-thirds of
the CONUS...

...Spring-like temperature regime engulfing much of the Heartland
reaches the East Coast by Tuesday, cooler than normal conditions
up and down the West Coast...

...Favorable fire weather conditions in parts of the Southern
Plains and Southwest...

The first in a pair of Pacific storm systems is currently
producing areas of showers and mountain snow across the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies. A brief lull in the action tonight
and into Monday morning gives way to the second round of Pacific
moisture arriving Monday afternoon. A steady diet of Pacific
moisture will persist into Thursday as a deep upper level trough
off the West Coast takes its time heading east. As the trough
reaches the coast Tuesday night, snow levels will continue to drop
with measurable snowfall in the Shasta and Sierra Nevada of
northern California. Snowfall accumulations up to a foot are
possible in the highest elevations through Tuesday night. Snow is
also expected to blanket the northern Rockies but with slightly
less snowfall accumulation. Meanwhile, the wettest area across the
Lower 48 through Tuesday evening is likely to be the coast of
northern California and southwest Oregon. To the east, much of the
eastern U.S. is under the influence of strong high pressure, thus
causing mostly dry conditions for most areas east of the Rockies.
The lone exception is northern New England where passing snow
showers are possible as a weak wave of low pressure pushes through
the region.

The aforementioned upper trough will be responsible for ushering
in cooler than normal conditions along the West Coast. As the
trough inches its way into the Intermountain West late Tuesday,
expect cooler temperatures to replace the spring-like temperatures
that were observed this weekend. Speaking of "spring", pleasantly
mild temperatures will stick around from the Four Corners region
to the Plains and Midwest on Monday. The dome of spring-like
temperatures makes its way into the Mid-South and Great Lakes on
Monday, then reaches the East Coast by Tuesday. Daily record warm
max and min temperatures are likely in the North Central U.S. on
Monday and Tuesday with daily record warm min temps becoming more
widespread from the Midwest to the Southern Plains Wednesday
morning.

The Southwest and Southern Plains are caught between the upper
trough along the West Coast and ridging over the eastern U.S.,
prompting brisk southerly flow to develop. Combined with low
humidity levels, fire weather is likely to be a daily concern in
these areas. A Critical Risk from the SPC Fire Weather Outlook is
in place over eastern Kansas today with Elevated Risks issued on
Monday for southeast Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and the
southern High Plains. Look for the fire weather threat to linger
into Tuesday across portions of the southern High Plains.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun March 07 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Weather/Threats Highlights and Guidance/Predictability
Assessment...

An amplified and southern stream upper trough/closed low will
settle over the West/Southwest later this week into the weekend in
a pattern with above normal forecast predictability. System track,
deformation and upslope will favor some enhanced rain and higher
elevation snow over the south-central CA/Great Basin/Rockies/High
Plains along with advent of below normal temperatures. Lead
energies forecast to eject from the trough will support a quite
wavy and slow-moving south-central to Mid-South front whose Gulf
moisture and instability pooling will fuel a focus for locally
enhanced rainfall and training convection. Ahead of this
evolution, upper ridging will support much above normal
temperatures for the East into later this week. A cold front will
dig through the East later week into the weekend in response to
amplified northern stream upper trough passage.

A composite blend of reasonably well clustered guidance from the
18/00 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12/00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and
the 01 UTC National Blend of Models seems to offer a good forecast
starting point and continuity days 3-5.

Forecast uncertainty increases by later weekend when the Southwest
feature seems slated to eject to the south-central U.S.. Height
falls and instability may re-invigorate moisture inflow and heavy
precipitation potential over and onward from the south-central
U.S.. This would include a wintry threat focus for the
south-central Rockies/High Plains that has potential to spread
across the central Plains and Mid-MS Valley/Midwest by early next
week on the cooled northern edge of the expanding precipitation
shield with system progression and wrapping flow.

For this day 6/7 period, the 12/18 UTC GFS/GEFS are progressive
compared to the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and to a lesser
extent the 12 UTC Canadian. Prefer a solution on the less
progressive side of the full envelope of guidance closest to the
ECMWF ensemble mean considering flow separation and closed
trough/low nature. The 00 UTC ECMWF trended closer to the ECMWF
ensemble mean. The 00 UTC GFS/Canadian/GEFS mean have trended
significantly slower and more in line, bolstering forecast
confidence, but forecast spread and continuity remain less than
ideal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CST Mon Mar 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
An active fire weather pattern will begin today and is expected to
persist well into the middle of the work week. This will mainly be
driven by persistent upper-level troughing over the West Coast with
strong mid and upper-level west/southwesterly flow across the
Southwest into the southern High Plains. Consequently, surface
pressure falls over the inter-mountain West and along the lee of the
Rockies will help augment regional surface pressure gradients and
downslope flow. For today, areas of elevated fire weather conditions
are expected, particularly for southeast AZ into the
southern/central High Plains and eastern Kansas.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
The latest surface observations show winds already increasing to
around 15 mph across the TX/OK Panhandles in response to the onset
of lee troughing across eastern CO. This trend will continue through
the day as upper-level flow increases over the Rockies (likely aided
by an embedded shortwave impulse noted over southern CA). While
modest moisture return is ongoing across the TX Panhandle, 15-25 mph
downslope flow should allow 15-25% RH to overspread northeast NM
into eastern CO and adjacent areas of the TX/OK Panhandles and KS.
Elevated fire weather conditions appear likely, and brief critical
conditions are possible. Additionally, elevated conditions may
extend as far north as northeast CO and southeast WY, but confidence
in RH reductions diminishes this far north.

...Southwest...
Dry conditions have been noted across much of AZ over the past few
days with afternoon RH in the teens and low 20s. Minimal moisture
return into the region will result in another day of dry conditions
with similar RH reductions. A weak surface low, noted over central
NV, will deepen as it moves to the northeast, resulting in
strengthening surface winds up to 25 mph across northern AZ and
southern UT. While elevated meteorological conditions are expected,
fuels remain below critical thresholds for the majority of the
region. To the south, fuels are more receptive and will support an
elevated fire weather concern. Relative humidity values will likely
fall into the low teens and single digits. However, this region will
be on the periphery of the stronger mid-level flow and displaced
from the tighter surface pressure gradient, suggesting that 15-20
mph winds will be more common.

...Eastern Kansas...
Another day of breezy conditions is expected across OK and KS due to
lee troughing to the west with a persistent surface high to the
east. While the strongest gradient winds will likely reside across
central/western KS (where modest moisture advection is expected),
sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely for eastern KS.
Regional 00 UTC soundings reveal dry boundary layers with minimal
moisture improvements upstream from eastern KS (across OK and TX).
Observed relative humidity values were lower yesterday (Saturday)
than forecast by most guidance, and a similar trend is possible
today given a similar synoptic regime. With receptive fuels already
in place, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Southeast and the Carolinas...
Dry conditions will continue across the Southeast for today with
afternoon RH values falling well into the 20s, and possibly high
teens, from central AL into the western Carolinas. A few locations
have cured fuels that could support a wildfire threat, but surface
high pressure will limit wind speeds and the overall fire weather
concern.

...Rain and higher elevation snow for the Northwest and
California, while light snow develops over parts of the Great
Basin and Northern/Central Rockies through Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Upper Midwest on Monday into Tuesday...

...Favorable fire weather conditions in parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains and Southwest...

A deepening upper-level trough will move onshore over the West
Coast, with embedded areas of upper-level energy moving across the
area through Wednesday.  The energy will produce coastal rain and
higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern California starting during the late morning on Monday.
The rain and snow expand northward and southward over the West
Coast, and snow will expand inland to the Northern Rockies by late
Monday afternoon.  By noon on Tuesday, rain and snow will move
into parts of the Northern High Plains/Northern Plains.  As
additional upper-level energy moves onshore overnight Tuesday,
coastal rain and higher elevation snow will increase slightly over
the West.

Meanwhile, the associated front will extend from the Upper
Mississippi Valley to the Great Basin on Tuesday evening.  The
boundary will be the focus for light rain to develop over parts of
the Upper Midwest overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.  Ahead of the
front, upper-level ridging will allow the temperatures to be 15 to
25 degrees above average over parts of the Upper Midwest on Monday
into Tuesday.

The Southwest and Central/Southern High Plains are caught between
the upper-trough along the West Coast and ridging over the eastern
U.S., prompting brisk southerly flow to develop.  Combined with
low humidity levels, fire weather is likely to be a daily concern
in these areas.  An Elevated Risk from the SPC Fire Weather
Outlook is in place over eastern Kansas.  Additional Elevated Risk
areas were issued on Monday for southeast Arizona, southwest New
Mexico, and the Central/Southern High Plains.  Look for the fire
weather threat to linger into Tuesday across portions of the
Central/Southern High Plains.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND THE
NORTHWESTERN OK/TX PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level flow is forecast to increase over the southern and
central Rockies over the next 48 hours. As this occurs, a lee
trough/surface low will likely develop over eastern CO and may begin
to shift into the central Plains. Southwesterly winds behind the
trailing surface trough will support downslope warming and drying
across the southern High Plains and southern AZ/NM. Additionally, a
weak cold front will likely begin pushing southeastward behind the
surface low across SD and NE. Breezy post-frontal conditions will
introduce fire weather concerns across a region that has seen
warm/dry conditions in recent days.

...Southern High Plains and southern Arizona/New Mexico...
Recent guidance continues to show reasonable agreement in the
potential for elevated to critical fire weather conditions from the
greater Panhandles region southwestward into southern AZ and NM. The
strongest mid-level flow is currently expected across eastern NM
into the OK/TX Panhandles. Deep boundary-layer mixing by late
afternoon should capitalize on the stronger flow and support
sustained winds near or above 20 mph with frequent gusts up to 30
mph (perhaps up to 40 mph). This will also help relative humidity
values fall into the low teens. Localized critical conditions will
be possible elsewhere within the broader elevated risk area where
15-20% RH will be common. Fuel reports from this region indicate
that fuels are either already receptive or are curing, which should
support a fire weather concern.

...Nebraska...
Breezy and dry post-frontal conditions appear likely in the wake of
a cold front Tuesday afternoon across southwest SD into northwest
NE. Weakness of cold advection behind the front should allow
temperatures to warm sufficiently by late afternoon for relative
humidity values to fall into the low 20s and perhaps teens. After a
few days of warm and dry conditions, fine fuels across this region
have cured with 10-hour fuel moisture values in the 5-10% range.
This should be sufficient to support an elevated fire weather
concern.

...Southeast...
Persistent surface high pressure will continue to limit winds across
much of the Southeast for Tuesday. While weak winds will mitigate
the fire weather concern, minimal moisture return into the region
and mostly clear skies will continue to cure already drying fuels
and allow RH values to fall into the 20s (and perhaps upper teens)
again during the afternoon.

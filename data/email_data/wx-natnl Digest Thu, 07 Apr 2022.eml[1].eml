Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1146 AM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST COLORADO INTO
NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The ongoing forecast remains on track. Elevated to critical
conditions are already being observed across the Southern Plains.
Within the combined Panhandles, RH has already fallen to near 10%
with winds over 30 mph and gusts of 35-45 mph. Extremely critical
conditions may occur for short periods in adjacent areas of
southeast Colorado and southwest Oklahoma. These critical to
extremely critical conditions will occur in areas that have seen
recent large fire activity.

..Wendt.. 04/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough is apparent in early morning water vapor
imagery over the central CONUS. At the surface, a low is beginning
to occlude over MN with an attendant cold front arcing southwestward
into north TX. This low will largely remain in place today with the
associated surface trough/cold front shifting east through the
morning. To the west, surface high pressure will continue to build
amid broad upper-level ridging. Consequently, pressure gradient
winds will remain elevated overnight and increase through the day as
boundary-layer mixing increases. This will support Critical to
Extreme fire weather conditions for parts of the southern High
Plains where active wildfires have been noted over the past 24
hours.

...Southern High Plains...
Early morning surface observations show a dry, continental air mass
moving from the northern/central Plains (where dewpoints are in the
single digits) into the southern High Plains. The strong low-level
flow is maintaining boundary-layer mixing near the surface and poor
overnight RH recovery from southeast WY into the OK/TX Panhandles.
This air mass will undergo further drying today as winds increase in
response to the tightening pressure gradient and downslope flow off
the CO Rockies increases. Afternoon RH values are expected to fall
into the 15-20% range from eastern CO into central OK and northern
TX. Ensemble guidance continues to show high probability for
widespread critical fire weather conditions across this region with
20-30 mph sustained winds. Extremely critical conditions remain
likely across the OK/TX Panhandles where deep mixing will allow for
single-digit RH and wind gusts up to 40-50 mph. ERCs across this
region remain elevated near the 90th percentile, and these
conditions will likely impact recent fires across the OK Panhandle.
Similar wind speeds are probable further north into eastern CO and
western KS, but confidence in extremely critical RH is lower.

...Southern Texas...
Dry, post-frontal air will sweep across southern TX through the
morning hours. Mostly clear skies will allow for strong diurnal
warming and boundary-layer mixing, which should allow RH values into
fall into the 20-25% range. Frequent wind gusts up to 20-25 mph will
support periods of critical fire weather conditions, but widespread
elevated conditions appear more probable. Despite patchy rainfall
over the past two days, fuels across the majority of the region
remain very receptive and will support a fire weather concern across
most of southern TX.

...New Mexico...
Northwesterly pressure-gradient winds are expected to increase to
15-25 mph this afternoon from the Four Corners region into southern
NM. A dry air mass currently over parts of the Great Basin (where
dewpoints are in the low teens) will shift into the Four Corners/NM
region by late afternoon. Downslope affects will support additional
drying with RH values in the low teens to single digits likely.
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions are expected, but
modest fuel status (ERCs between the 50-70th percentile) will
preclude a greater concern.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 06 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast across the east-central
contiguous
U.S. during week-2, with surface low pressure favored to track across the
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes at the outset of the period. As a result,
ongoing impacts related to heavy rainfall are forecast across much of the
eastern U.S., as well as potentially heavy snowfall continuing over portions
of
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. While this surface low is forecast to
move out quickly, the mid-level pattern looks to become less progressive later
in week-2, with mid-level low pressure persisting over the East, and a
potential stalled frontal boundary serving as a focus for continued enhanced
rainfall chances along the East Coast and Southeast. Below normal temperatures
are favored across much of the western and central CONUS on the backside of
the
mid-level low. Easterly surface flow is indicated across Alaska, favoring
increased chances for below normal temperatures over most of the state.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the
Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies, and Great Plains, Thu-Fri, Apr 14-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the western
CONUS,
Great Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes, Thu-Wed,
Apr 14-20.

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Lower Mississippi
and Tennessee Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast, Thu, Apr 14.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the southeastern quadrant of
the
CONUS, and along the Eastern Seaboard, Thu-Wed, Apr 14-20.

Slight risk for high winds across portions of the Northern and Central Plains,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, Thu-Fri,
Apr
14-15.

Slight risk for heavy snow across portions of the Northern Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, and northwestern Great Lakes, Thu, Apr 14.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of eastern Mainland
Alaska, and the Panhandle, Thu-Mon, Apr 14-18.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North and the Illinois River.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 09 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 13:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!ut5NRjmd_OuhKO-o4QjyPNBVXpxOPeUKWvpesAs3PjwpxqcORiex8DvzYHz6Ow0_UtaJb5O_$

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 14 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 20: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles all depict anomalous troughing and associated surface low pressure
tracking across the Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes at the outset of
week-2.
The ECMWF ensemble is the most robust with the surface low, with the GEFS
being
on the weaker side. Most of the impacts are forecast to be more focused on
day-7, and be winding down by day-8, but heavy rain and frontally focused
convection is possible across the southeastern quadrant of the CONUS in the
warm-sector, with a potential late-season snowstorm ongoing across the
north-central CONUS and Upper Midwest. A moderate risk for heavy precipitation
is posted across portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys,
Southern Appalachians, and Southeast on 4/14 given the good model agreement
regarding the initial surface low pressure and increased potential for
convective precipitation and thunderstorms over these areas, despite lower
probabilities for reaching hazards thresholds in the reforecast tools. A
slight
risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted over these same areas and extends
northward along the Eastern Seaboard for all of week-2. While the bulk of the
rainfall is forecast early in the period, there are some indications that the
trailing front may stall across the Southeast and East Coast later in week-2,
prolonging rainfall chances, especially if an additional area of surface low
pressure tracks along the stalled front as indicated by some of the
deterministic GFS guidance. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at
least a 20 percent chance 3-day precipitation exceeds the 85th climatological
percentile throughout the period over parts of the highlighted region, with
the
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble indicating some areas with at least a 20 percent
chance of having 3-day precipitation totals over an inch.



A slight risk of heavy snow continues across parts of the Northern and Central
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and northwestern Great Lakes on 4/14 to
account for increased potential for snow to the northwest of the surface low
track, and where the GEFS reforecast tool depicts around a 20 percent chance
snow water equivalent exceeds the 85th climatological percentile. Following
recent runoff from snowmelt, spring flooding is ongoing along portions of the
Red River of the North and the Illinois River, and is expected to continue
into
week-2 due to additional precipitation forecast over both regions. Therefore,
a
flooding possible hazard is indicated over parts of these river valleys.



Increased wind speeds will also be possible on the backside of the departing
surface low. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 20 percent chance
wind speeds exceed the 85th climatological percentile and 20-mph across much
of
the north-central CONUS and Midwest early in the period. There is less support
from the GEFS, likely due to its weaker depiction of the surface low compared
to the ECMWF. However, given the mid-level troughing moving overhead, and
general model agreement regarding the track of surface low pressure, a slight
risk of high winds is posted across portions of the Northern and Central
Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley from
4/14-4/15.



Anomalous northwesterly flow behind the mid-level troughing downstream favors
below normal temperatures expanding across much of the CONUS during week-2,
with some warming favored in the West by the middle of the period as mid-level
heights increase. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict at least a 20
percent chance that minimum temperatures drop below the 15th percentile and
freezing over parts of the western CONUS, Great Plains, and Midwest supporting
a broad slight risk for much below normal temperatures over these areas for
all
of week-2. Both reforecast tools indicate higher probabilities for minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th climatological percentile (greater than 40
percent) across portions of the Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies, and Great
Plains where a moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is highlighted
from 4/14-4/15. Minimum temperatures are forecast to be in the single digits
and teens deg F across high elevation areas of the Rockies and Great Basin,
and
in the 20s and 30s deg F across parts of the southwestern CONUS and Great
Plains.



Strong easterly surface flow is forecast over much of Alaska during week-2,
supporting increased cold air advection out of western Canada. A slight risk
of
much below normal temperatures is posted for much of eastern Mainland Alaska
and the Panhandle from 4/14-4/18, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures fall below the 10th
climatological percentile, and uncalibrated guidance depicting minimum
temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F in some areas. While temperatures
are not expected to be as cold as during the peak of winter, an extended
period
of anomalously cold temperatures during mid-April is likely to slow river ice
break up across Alaska. Toward the end of week-2, a more southerly component
to
the surface flow favors a moderation in temperatures, especially in the
southeastern part of the state.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0156 PM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO NORTH
TEXAS...

Primary change to the outlook was to expand the Critical area
northeastward into more of Kansas and Oklahoma. RH will become more
borderline to the north and to the east, but, given the very strong
winds over very dry fuels, rapid fire spread remains a concern.
Extremely critical fire weather may occur, but duration and spatial
extent are still expected to remain quite limited. See the previous
discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 04/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0210 AM CDT Wed Apr 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
The surface low currently over MN will meander east/southeast
towards the Great Lakes over the next 48 hours. To the west, a
surface high will build into the inter-mountain West, maintaining a
tight pressure gradient across the Plains. Another day of strong
northwesterly winds is expected with widespread sustained 20-30 mph
sustained winds from the Dakotas into central Texas. While
increasing cloud cover for much of the plains will mute diurnal RH
reductions, clear skies and downslope flow will resulting in another
day of widespread fire weather concerns for the southern High
Plains.

...Southern High Plains to central Texas...
Latest deterministic and ensemble guidance suggests that much of the
southern High Plains will remain under mostly clear skies through
the day Thursday. This will maximize diurnal heating and support
deep mixing. Low-level trajectories emanating from the central
Rockies will lead to additional warming/drying, resulting in RH
values between 15-20% from southeast CO into northern TX.
Probabilities for 20-25 mph winds across this region remain high,
and drier/windier solutions suggest sustained winds near 30-35 mph
are possible. Single digit RH may not be as widespread as compared
to Wednesday, but brief periods of extremely critical wind/RH may
develop across the TX Panhandle into northwest TX. Outside of the
Critical risk area, windy conditions are expected with widespread
20-30% RH from the CO/WY/NE tri-state region to the TX Gulf Coast.
Confidence in the fire weather potential decreases with northern and
eastern extent due to uncertainties in cloud cover. Clearing skies
by early afternoon may result in lower RH than currently forecast,
and may warrant an expansion of the risk areas given the strong
winds.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed April 06 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 12 - 16 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Amplified ridges and associated above normal 500-hPa heights
are predicted near the Bering Strait and over the North Pacific well off the
west coast of the CONUS. A deep trough and associated below normal 500-hPa
heights are forecast over the western and central CONUS. Ridging with above
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the western and central CONUS
underneath predicted troughing and enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Ridging
and above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of above normal
temperatures for most of the eastern CONUS and along the Gulf Coast. Below
normal temperatures are likely over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
while above normal temperatures are favored over the Aleutians, supported by
most of the dynamical model forecast tools.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for the Central Rockies,
eastward
to the central and eastern CONUS, due to a predicted deep trough over the
western and central CONUS. Above normal precipitation is likely over parts of
Washington, while below normal precipitation is favored over California,
Nevada, southeastern New Mexico and southwestern Texas, consistent with the
consolidation precipitation tool. Predicted mid-level ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights favor near to below normal precipitation over Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and on
the
forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 14 - 20 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the predicted week-2 mean 500-hPa circulation
pattern features below normal heights associated with deep troughing forecast
over the central CONUS. Conversely, ridging and associated positive 500-hPa
heights anomalies are forecast over both the West and East Coast of the CONUS.
Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights are also forecast over the Bering
Strait, the western Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska extending southward
into the adjacent North Pacific.

Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of above
normal temperatures for parts of  the southwestern CONUS and the East Coast of
the CONUS. Below normal temperatures are likely over most of the remainder of
the CONUS, associated with  predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa
heights over the central CONUS. Elevated probabilities of below normal
temperatures are forecast over Alaska, supported by most of the dynamical
model
forecast tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONUS, due to a
predicted trough over the central CONUS and the likelihood for a robust return
flow of Gulf moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high pressure
forecast over the Atlantic. Above normal precipitation probabilities are also
elevated across Washington, while increased probabilities for below normal
precipitation are favored over much of the remaining western and central
CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation precipitation tool. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored across southern Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, supported by GEFS and ECMWF calibrated reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and on
the
forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Overview...

An amplified pattern in the medium range will begin with a trough
moving out of the East while another trough deepens/gets
reinforced and slowly moves eastward in the West during the first
part of next week. The latter will spread rain/higher elevation
snow and well below normal temperatures across the West, with the
colder air and rain/snow reaching into parts of the northern and
central Plains by early-mid week. Ahead of the upper trough and
associated wavy surface front, moisture flowing northward from the
Gulf of Mexico should promote rainfall of varying intensity over
the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley next week. The East should
see cool weather with showers over some areas over the weekend,
but an upper ridge moving from the central to eastern U.S. will
bring warmer temperatures to the eastern half of the country for
the workweek.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

While model agreement and confidence remain good regarding the
eastern trough's track eastward this weekend as it departs, and
models generally show troughing amplifying and reloading over the
West, there remain ample differences among guidance for the
evolution of details regarding the western trough. Shortwaves that
should be embedded within the trough stem from low predictability
areas of the northern Pacific and near Alaska, tempering forecast
confidence in any particular solution. Examples of model
differences among the 00/06Z models include a narrower trough axis
by Sunday in the CMC and UKMET with a hint of ridging on the
western side in the Pacific Northwest compared to GFS/ECMWF
guidance, as well as the strength and position of shortwaves in
the north-central U.S. and digging into the western side of the
trough by Monday. With the latter shortwave, models have tended to
show a stronger surface reflection just offshore the Pacific
Northwest but with varying positions. Into Tuesday and Wednesday,
GFS and ECMWF runs continue to show a deeper and slower trough
than CMC runs. But GFS runs are more phased than the ECMWF, as the
EC has been indicating additional strong energy dropping into the
Pacific Northwest by the end of the period. The WPC forecast
generally favored the ECMWF overall in terms of the deterministic
guidance, considering its persistence and continuity from run to
run. The newer 12Z ECMWF has generally kept a similar pattern.
Overall the WPC forecast began with a multi-model deterministic
blend led by the ECMWF and GFS, but as the period progressed
reduced the weighting of operational models other than the ECMWF
in favor of the reasonably well clustered (albeit less detailed)
EC and GEFS ensemble means to account for the increasing model
differences.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper trough currently expected to amplify into the West and
approach or reach the Plains by next Wednesday will first bring
rain and higher elevation snow into the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies during the weekend. Most totals should be in the
light to moderate range though some localized enhancement is
possible over favored terrain. A more favorable combination of
upper trough dynamics and low level upslope flow should increase
precipitation over the northern-central Rockies and High Plains
during the first part of next week, with the High Plains possibly
seeing some springtime snow in addition to the Rockies. There are
still important uncertainties over the details of the upper trough
so confidence is not great in southward extent and amounts of
precipitation across central/southern parts of the West--and to
some degree over the Rockies/Plains--at this time. Meanwhile in
the warm sector, there will be increasing coverage and intensity
of rainfall over the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley with the
establishment of moist low level flow from the Gulf of Mexico.
Farther east, cold air aloft associated with the upper trough
crossing the East during the weekend will promote areas of
diurnally enhanced showers from the Ohio Valley/Appalachians into
the Northeast especially on Saturday before a drier trend over the
Eastern Seaboard early next week. Some precipitation could be in
the form of snow, with the best chances across the peaks of the
Central Appalachians in West Virginia.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-15F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
during the weekend. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs
should then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. Sunday may
provide the best potential for some locations in the Northwest to
see max temperatures near or below current record cold highs.
Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend from mostly
below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F anomalies Saturday),
and potential for a late frost across parts of the southeastern
quadrant of the country, to mostly above normal readings (plus
5-15F anomalies) spreading from west to east after the weekend.

approach or reach the Plains by next Wednesday will first bring
rain and higher elevation snow into the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies during the weekend. Most totals should be in the
light to moderate range though some localized enhancement is
possible over favored terrain. A more favorable combination of
upper trough dynamics and low level upslope flow should increase
precipitation over the northern-central Rockies and High Plains
during the first part of next week, with the High Plains possibly
seeing some springtime snow in addition to the Rockies. There are
still important uncertainties over the details of the upper trough
so confidence is not great in southward extent and amounts of
precipitation across central/southern parts of the West--and to
some degree over the Rockies/Plains--at this time. Meanwhile in
the warm sector, there will be increasing coverage and intensity
of rainfall over the eastern Plains/Mississippi Valley with the
establishment of moist low level flow from the Gulf of Mexico.
Farther east, cold air aloft associated with the upper trough
crossing the East during the weekend will promote areas of
diurnally enhanced showers from the Ohio Valley/Appalachians into
the Northeast especially on Saturday before a drier trend over the
Eastern Seaboard early next week. Some precipitation could be in
the form of snow, with the best chances across the peaks of the
Central Appalachians in West Virginia.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-15F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
during the weekend. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs
should then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. Sunday may
provide the best potential for some locations in the Northwest to
see max temperatures near or below current record cold highs.
Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend from mostly
below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F anomalies Saturday),
and potential for a late frost across parts of the southeastern
quadrant of the country, to mostly above normal readings (plus
5-15F anomalies) spreading from west to east after the weekend.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Multi-day wet snow and local lake effect event over the Upper
Midwest through Friday...

...There is an Extreme to Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts
of the Plains...

Deep low pressure over the Upper Great Lakes and a strong area of
high pressure over the Pacific Northwest will combine to produce a
very strong pressure gradient over the Northern/Central High
Plains, prompting High Wind Warnings over the Region through
Wednesday evening to midnight local time.

Furthermore, a strong front over the Upper Great Lakes to the
Central Gulf Coast, along with a wave of low pressure on the
associated warm front over the Mid-Atlantic, will produce rain and
snow over the Upper Midwest and showers and thunderstorms over the
Ohio Valley south and eastward to the Southeast and the coast to
the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic overnight Wednesday into
late Thursday. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern
Appalachians and Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes. In addition, heavy rain will be associated with
these thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall through Thursday morning over
Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic. The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

The severe thunderstorm threat decreases slightly on Thursday over
parts of the Southeast and Southern Appalachians. Therefore, the
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast and Southern Appalachians for Thursday through
Friday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. The threat of excessive rainfall ends over the
Southeast on Thursday.

Meanwhile, Multi-day wet snow and local lake effect event will
develop over the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great
Lakes. Some areas get 12 inches of lake effect snow with the
favorable flow off Lake Superior. Additionally, rain and snow will
start over the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Wisconsin on
Wednesday afternoon into evening, then changes over to wet snow.
The snow will continue over the region through Thursday evening,
then light snow over most of the region. However, the lake effect
will continue in the western portions of the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan with the flow off of Lake Superior.

Gusty winds, low humidity, and dry fuels will contribute to the
SPC issuing an Extreme Risk over the Southern High Plains in Texas
and Oklahoma on Wednesday into Thursday morning. However, on
Thursday, the fire weather threat will decrease to an Elevated
Risk over the Southern High Plains.

Furthermore, an approaching front over the Pacific will move
onshore over the Pacific Northwest overnight Thursday moving to
the Northern Rockies by late afternoon Friday. As a result, light
rain will develop over parts of the Northwest overnight Thursday
and continue into Friday. After the front passes on Friday
morning, the snow levels will lower over the Cascades, allowing
light snow to develop at higher elevations.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0113 AM CDT Thu Apr 07 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Today will see another round of widespread fire weather concerns
from the central High Plains to the Texas Gulf Coast. A dry
continental air mass continues to overspread the central CONUS with
dewpoints along the High Plains in the single digits after warm,
dry, and windy conditions today. An occluded surface low over the
western Great Lakes will gradually shift east through the day while
a surface high continues to build over the inter-mountain West. The
resulting pressure gradient will support widespread 20-30 mph
sustained winds across the Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Wednesday afternoon saw widespread 20-30 mph winds from the central
to southern Plains. Frequent wind gusts between 40-60 mph were noted
from northwest OK into the central High Plains. Similar wind speeds
are expected this afternoon as the regional pressure gradient
remains in place. Locations that see mostly sunny skies by early
afternoon will experience enough daytime heating/deep mixing to
realize the stronger wind gusts. This appears most likely from
southeast CO and southwest KS into portions of northwest TX. With
single digit dewpoints noted across this region, and further
downslope drying likely, RH values will fall into the low teens and
support widespread critical fire weather conditions. Locations
further to the northeast will see similar sustained winds (though
perhaps slightly lower gusts) with RH values in the 20-30% range.
Ensemble guidance suggests that sustained extremely critical
conditions are unlikely, but at least periodic extreme conditions
are probable from southeast CO into western OK as RH dips below 10%
in conjunction with the higher gusts. These conditions will likely
impact locations that have seen large fire activity over the past
couple of days.

...New Mexico...
Fuels across NM have been trending drier after several days of
warm/dry conditions. An antecedent dry air mass over the greater
Four Corners region will maintain depressed RH values 15% or lower
this afternoon. Winds will increase to 15-20 mph by late afternoon,
supporting widespread elevated conditions (and localized critical
conditions where winds are locally enhanced near terrain features).


...Texas Gulf Coast...
Breezy northerly winds between 15-20 mph will extend across central
TX into the northwest Gulf. The dry air mass currently upstream
across the TX Panhandle and western OK will overspread the region by
peak daytime heating, allowing for RH reductions into the 20-25%
range. Elevated conditions are expected, but localized critical
conditions appear likely. Fuels with ERC values between the 80-90th
percentiles will support the fire weather threat.

Extended Forecast Discussion

259 AM EDT Thu Apr 07 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 10 2022 - 12Z Thu Apr 14 2022

...Active weather likely across a large part of the country next
week...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified pattern in which
one upper trough departs from the East after Sunday while energy
digging in from the northeastern Pacific reinforces western U.S.
mean troughing that should finally emerge into the Plains by
around midweek. There is a decent signal in the guidance that this
pattern should produce active weather over a significant portion
of the lower 48 next week--including rain/snow over the West,
eventually a vigorous storm system over the Plains/Upper Midwest
with some snow to the northwest of its track, and a threat for
areas of heavy rainfall plus strong to severe convection over some
southern areas of the central U.S. However within this broad theme
there are a number of uncertainties for details that temper
confidence in specifics of the forecast, not only for the main
area of focus over the western-central U.S. but also frontal
position over the East due to differences in how leading shortwave
energy initially ejecting across the Plains ultimately evolves.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Aside from the fairly stable handling of the upper trough
departing from the East early in the period, latest models and
ensembles are generally still finding it challenging to resolve
some important aspects of the forecast. Depiction of leading
shortwave energy crossing the northern tier U.S. and southern
Canada has recently become an increasingly problematic part of the
forecast, leading to some wide differences in the southern extent
of a front over the East. 12Z and new 00Z UKMET runs are on the
extremely amplified side of the spread with the shortwave energy
and thus push the front quite far south. On the other hand the 12Z
ECMWF deflected the energy around the eastern North America ridge,
keeping the front farthest north. Given the current spread,
preference was to emphasize the 12Z ECMWF and the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means which lean toward the northern side of the spread for
the front but represent a modest southward adjustment from
continuity. Further changes can be made if newer guidance improves
confidence.

Meanwhile farther west, guidance is still working on how to depict
Gulf of Alaska energy that should flow southeastward into the
western U.S., with modest differences in timing and exactly when a
closed low forms having significant influence on the character of
low pressure nearing the central/northern West Coast by early
Monday. The manual forecast shows a better defined system than the
weak and suppressed 12Z (and new 00Z) ECMWF but not as strong as
the GFS/UKMET/CMC given the currently low predictability of this
evolution. By late in the period the ensemble spaghetti plots are
extremely messy over the eastern Pacific and western U.S. so
detail confidence remains quite low. In light of this uncertainty,
there is a positive consideration that the 18Z/00Z GFS and latest
CMC/ECMWF runs all cluster decently in principle for how the upper
trough/low ejects into the Plains/Midwest to produce what would be
a significant storm system with general support from the ensemble
means.

Trailing flow could bring another system toward the Pacific
Northwest but again with below average confidence. The new 00Z GFS
has trended favorably toward the ensemble means for the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. upper pattern by the end of the period, in
contrast to the strong ridge or southern/elongated trough of the
12Z and 18Z runs respectively.

As mentioned above, the first half of the forecast emphasized the
12Z ECMWF and 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means to yield the desired
frontal alignment over the East, with only 30 percent total input
of the 18Z GFS and 12Z CMC/UKMET. Later in the period a more
balanced model/mean blend captured a good intermediate starting
point for the system that may track into the Plains and Upper
Midwest by next Wednesday-Thursday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3-4 days out in time as guidance varies widely for
the strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains possibly seeing some springtime snow in
addition to the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may
track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow
farther northeast across the northern tier along with strong
winds. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there will be increasing
coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Persistence of the Gulf inflow
could lead to a couple days or so with a heavy rain threat over or
near the Lower Mississippi Valley. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over some
southern areas in the central U.S. Check their latest outlooks for
more information. Farther north, a front draped over the Midwest
could also provide a focus for rainfall though likely with lower
totals given less moisture/instability. Lack of confidence in some
specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow maintains the
potential for some changes in the above most likely scenario.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-20F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
as of Sunday. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs should
then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. The northern
half of the Plains should still see highs around 15-20F below
normal on Thursday. Sunday should provide the best potential for
some locations in the Northwest to see max temperatures near or
below current record cold highs but Monday could still produce a
few lingering records. Meanwhile most of the eastern half of the
country should trend from mostly below normal temperatures (minus
5-15F anomalies) on Sunday, and potential for a late frost across
parts of the southeastern quadrant of the country, to mostly above
normal readings (plus 5-15F anomalies for highs and perhaps
slightly warmer for morning lows) spreading from west to east
after the weekend. However confidence is lower for exact
temperatures over the northern half of the East due to uncertain
position of a front during the first half of next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Thu Apr 07 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 10 2022 - 12Z Thu Apr 14 2022

...Active weather likely across a large part of the country next
week...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an amplified pattern in which
one upper trough departs from the East after Sunday while energy
digging in from the northeastern Pacific reinforces western U.S.
mean troughing that should finally emerge into the Plains by
around midweek. There is a decent signal in the guidance that this
pattern should produce active weather over a significant portion
of the lower 48 next week--including rain/snow over the West,
eventually a vigorous storm system over the Plains/Upper Midwest
with some snow to the northwest of its track, and a threat for
areas of heavy rainfall plus strong to severe convection over some
southern areas of the central U.S. However within this broad theme
there are a number of uncertainties for details that temper
confidence in specifics of the forecast, not only for the main
area of focus over the western-central U.S. but also frontal
position over the East due to differences in how leading shortwave
energy initially ejecting across the Plains ultimately evolves.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Aside from the fairly stable handling of the upper trough
departing from the East early in the period, latest models and
ensembles are generally still finding it challenging to resolve
some important aspects of the forecast. Depiction of leading
shortwave energy crossing the northern tier U.S. and southern
Canada has recently become an increasingly problematic part of the
forecast, leading to some wide differences in the southern extent
of a front over the East. 12Z and new 00Z UKMET runs are on the
extremely amplified side of the spread with the shortwave energy
and thus push the front quite far south. On the other hand the 12Z
ECMWF deflected the energy around the eastern North America ridge,
keeping the front farthest north. Given the current spread,
preference was to emphasize the 12Z ECMWF and the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means which lean toward the northern side of the spread for
the front but represent a modest southward adjustment from
continuity. Further changes can be made if newer guidance improves
confidence.

Meanwhile farther west, guidance is still working on how to depict
Gulf of Alaska energy that should flow southeastward into the
western U.S., with modest differences in timing and exactly when a
closed low forms having significant influence on the character of
low pressure nearing the central/northern West Coast by early
Monday. The manual forecast shows a better defined system than the
weak and suppressed 12Z (and new 00Z) ECMWF but not as strong as
the GFS/UKMET/CMC given the currently low predictability of this
evolution. By late in the period the ensemble spaghetti plots are
extremely messy over the eastern Pacific and western U.S. so
detail confidence remains quite low. In light of this uncertainty,
there is a positive consideration that the 18Z/00Z GFS and latest
CMC/ECMWF runs all cluster decently in principle for how the upper
trough/low ejects into the Plains/Midwest to produce what would be
a significant storm system with general support from the ensemble
means.

Trailing flow could bring another system toward the Pacific
Northwest but again with below average confidence. The new 00Z GFS
has trended favorably toward the ensemble means for the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. upper pattern by the end of the period, in
contrast to the strong ridge or southern/elongated trough of the
12Z and 18Z runs respectively.

As mentioned above, the first half of the forecast emphasized the
12Z ECMWF and 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means to yield the desired
frontal alignment over the East, with only 30 percent total input
of the 18Z GFS and 12Z CMC/UKMET. Later in the period a more
balanced model/mean blend captured a good intermediate starting
point for the system that may track into the Plains and Upper
Midwest by next Wednesday-Thursday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Early in the period expect the best rain/mountain snow focus to be
over the Pacific Northwest and central West Coast. However the
details of location and intensity are unusually uncertain for a
forecast only 3-4 days out in time as guidance varies widely for
the strength and track of arriving low pressure. Lighter activity
should prevail eastward through the northern Rockies. Then some
moisture should extend southward into the Sierra Nevada, with rain
and mountain snow extending across central and possibly some
southern parts of the West. By Tuesday the southern Montana into
Colorado Rockies and north-central High Plains should begin to see
a favorable combination of upper trough dynamics and low level
upslope flow that would increase precipitation over those areas,
with the High Plains possibly seeing some springtime snow in
addition to the Rockies. Potentially strong low pressure that may
track from the Plains into the Upper Midwest would extend snow
farther northeast across the northern tier along with strong
winds. Meanwhile in the warm sector, there will be increasing
coverage and intensity of rainfall over the eastern
Plains/Mississippi Valley with the establishment of moist low
level flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Persistence of the Gulf inflow
could lead to a couple days or so with a heavy rain threat over or
near the Lower Mississippi Valley. Also the Storm Prediction
Center is monitoring the potential for severe weather over some
southern areas in the central U.S. Check their latest outlooks for
more information. Farther north, a front draped over the Midwest
could also provide a focus for rainfall though likely with lower
totals given less moisture/instability. Lack of confidence in some
specifics of eastern Pacific/western U.S. flow maintains the
potential for some changes in the above most likely scenario.

Colder air moving into the West will initially bring highs down to
as much as 10-20F below normal over the Northwest/northern Rockies
as of Sunday. An area of minus 10-25F anomalies for highs should
then reach into the Intermountain West, Rockies, and
northern-central Plains by next Tuesday-Wednesday. The northern
half of the Plains should still see highs around 15-20F below
normal on Thursday. Sunday should provide the best potential for
some locations in the Northwest to see max temperatures near or
below current record cold highs but Monday could still produce a
few lingering records. Meanwhile most of the eastern half of the
country should trend from mostly below normal temperatures (minus
5-15F anomalies) on Sunday, and potential for a late frost across
parts of the southeastern quadrant of the country, to mostly above
normal readings (plus 5-15F anomalies for highs and perhaps
slightly warmer for morning lows) spreading from west to east
after the weekend. However confidence is lower for exact
temperatures over the northern half of the East due to uncertain
position of a front during the first half of next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Thu Apr 07 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO WESTERN
OKLAHOMA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NEBRASKA INTO NORTH-CENTRAL
KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
The compact regional pressure gradient over the Plains will abate
slightly on Friday. While this will result in slightly lower speeds
compared to previous days, winds will remain strong enough to
support widespread fire weather concerns over the Plains. The
persistent northerly flow will allow for no moisture return into the
region, and afternoon RH values will largely be dependent on daily
max temperatures. Latest guidance shows reasonably high confidence
in a broad swath of elevated wind/RH conditions through much of the
Plains where fuels are generally very receptive (ERC values at the
85th percentile or higher). Critical conditions are possible across
much of the broader Elevated risk area, but Critical delineations
are made where confidence in sustained 20+ mph winds is highest.

...Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma...
Widespread RH reductions between 10-15% are expected from eastern NM
into western OK Friday afternoon. With the surface high gradually
shifting east, the strongest gradient winds over the southern High
Plains will likely develop between the I-27 and I-35 corridors.
Ensemble guidance suggests the highest probability for sustained
critical wind/RH conditions lies across the eastern TX Panhandle and
western OK, but refinement of the risk area is possible as guidance
comes into better agreement regarding regional details.

...Central Plains...
20-25 mph northerly winds appear likely across NE and KS Friday
afternoon. Despite an influx of cooler temperatures, daytime heating
should support enough warming/mixing for RH reductions near 20% and
possibly as low as 15%. As with the southern High Plains, most
solutions show critical wind/RH conditions across the central
Plains, but spread in the exact coverage is noted. Ensemble guidance
shows reasonably high probability for sustained Critical conditions
across central NE to north-central KS, but an expansion to this area
is possible.

...Southern California and northern Nevada...
Elevated wind/RH conditions are expected across the higher terrain
of the south California coast and across northern Nevada through the
day Friday. Drier solutions hint that localized critical conditions
are possible for both regions, but latest fuel guidance for both
coastal CA and northern NV suggest live fuel moisture remains too
high to support a more robust fire weather concern.

Plains...

...Elevated to extreme fire weather risk over portions of the

parts of California...

A deep and expansive low pressure system centered over the upper
Midwest has begun to weaken but more unsettled weather is expected
for much of the northern and eastern U.S. over the next couple of
days.  First of all, much of the northern and central Plains will
continue to be impacted by strong and gusty winds through today
and into Friday as the cyclone pulls abnormally cold air down from
Canada.  To the north of the storm center, temperatures will be
cold enough to support wet snow from northern Minnesota to the
upper Great Lakes while mixed rain and snow can be expected
farther south into the upper Midwest.  Some areas near the south
shore of Lake Superior could get a foot or more of snow enhanced
by favorable flow across the lake waters.  As the low pressure
system gradually weakens with time, it will begin to slide across
the Great Lakes.  Some the lake effect snow will continue downwind
from the lake waters.  The large area of precipitation associated
with the system will then head across the Ohio Valley toward the
Appalachians on Friday.  By early Saturday morning, some wet snow
can be expected across the higher elevations from the upper Ohio
Valley to the Appalachians as temperatures drop to near freezing
at the coldest locations.

Meanwhile on the warm side of the system, scattered clusters of
showers and thunderstorms are steadily moving into the East Coast
ahead of an active cold front.  The southeastern U.S. will be
under the highest threat of
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms this morning, possibly
reaching the Mid-Atlantic coast during the day as a low pressure
wave is forecast to develop along the cold front.  This area of
low pressure is expected to intensify and move up toward the
southern New England coast by tonight.  Some enhanced rainfall
ahead of the low is forecast to move through New England tonight
along with gusty winds.  In addition, the higher elevations of
interior New England could see rain changing to a period of wintry
precipitation Thursday night into Friday morning.

Gusty winds, low humidity, and dry fuels will continue to promote
elevated to extreme fire danger over portions of the central to
southern Plains for today with a gradually diminishing threat by
the weekend.

A strong ridge of high pressure aloft is forecast to build across
the western U.S. into late week.  This ridge will dispel the cold
and windy weather up north as heat will progressively build across
the Southwest.  In fact, high temperatures are forecast to
challenge records by this afternoon in California, with readings
possibly reaching the century mark near Los Angeles.  Gusty Santa
Ana winds could also make an appearance as the Rockies high
pressure system builds southward.  More record high temperatures
are forecast for Friday
as the next Pacific cold front reaches the West Coast with
rain/snow reaching the Pacific Northwest tonight/Friday morning.
By Saturday morning, much colder air will be ushered across the
northern Rockies behind the strong cold front.

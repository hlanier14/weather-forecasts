Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 22 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 24 2021

...Monsoon intensity and the threat of flash flooding to ramp up
across the Southwest...

...Midsummer heat persists across the Northern/Central Plains and
spreads into the Midwest, with the threat of severe thunderstorms
on Friday...

...Elevated to critical fire weather concerns remain throughout
the Northern Rockies and Great Basin...


The Southwest Monsoon has been very active as of late, but a more
notable increase in intensity is expected over the next few days.
An upper-level ridge centered over the Four Corners and an
upper-level low retrograding westward out of Texas will help
funnel anomalous atmospheric moisture into the region. Widespread
rainfall amounts could reach over an inch both today and Friday
across parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and southwest Colorado, with
Friday forecast to be the more active day. While this rain is a
welcome sight across the drought-stricken areas of the Southwest,
intense downpours could lead to dangerous flash flooding. Recent
burn scars will be even more susceptible to rapid runoff and
debris flow. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has
been issued across much of central and eastern Arizona, western
New Mexico, and southwest Colorado. Flash Flood Watches have also
been issued here to highlight the potential hazard.

Hot summer days are expected to continue into the beginning of the
weekend throughout the Northern and Central Plains, as well as
parts of the Midwest. High temperatures are forecast to climb into
the upper 90s and low triple digits, which equates to around 10 to
15 degrees above average for this time of year. Excessive Heat
Warnings remain in effect for eastern Montana. As a cold front
eventually reaches the Northern Plains on Friday, thunderstorms
are expected to develop and possibly turn severe between North
Dakota and northern Minnesota. Damaging wind gusts and large hail
are expected to be the main concern. Farther west, gusty winds and
dry lightning combined with the established dry terrain will lead
to yet another day of fire weather concerns between the Great
Basin and northern Rockies. Elevated to critical fire weather
extends from the northern Sierra Nevada to northwest Montana,
where wildfires are expected to be most likely to spread
uncontrollably. Many residents across the central and eastern U.S.
have likely noticed very hazy skies due to wildfire smoke
transported from western sections North America. Smoke is forecast
to be thickest across the Carolinas, Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, Great
Lakes, and Upper Midwest today. As a result, Air Quality Alerts
have been issued for certain locations between Minnesota to North
Carolina.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and thunderstorms associated with a
gradually lifting warm front are likely over the next few days
throughout the Upper Great Lakes. Portions of the Southeast and
the Florida Panhandle are also in store for thunderstorm chances
as a stationary boundary and area of low pressure linger near the
region. A few isolated instances of flash flooding are possible
today across southeast Georgia and the South Carolina Lowcountry.

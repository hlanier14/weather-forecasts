Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
410 AM EDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 13 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021

...First winter storm of the season spreading heavy snow into the
northern High Plains today along with high winds...

...Severe weather and heavy rain over the central Plains today
will taper off some as they spread into the upper Midwest
tonight...

...Moisture drawn northward from Hurricane Pamela will enhance
heavy rain threat across the southern Plains by tonight...

The most active weather during the short-range period will be
found today across much of the Great Plains as a low pressure
system continues to intensify before reaching peak intensity
tonight.  The intense storm is responsible for the first winter
storm of the season currently in progress across the northern High
Plains where an additional foot of heavy snowfall is possible near
the adjoining borders of the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana along
with very strong and gusty winds.  Winter Storm Warnings and
Winter Weather Advisories remain in effect for much of the
northern High Plains.  Strong winds with gusts up to 60 mph are
also expected to accompany this storm as it intensifies further
while tracking towards the northern Plains.  High Wind Warnings
are currently in effect for a large section of the northern
Plains.

In addition to the wintry weather, severe thunderstorms are
expected to sweep across much of the central and southern Plains
today ahead of a vigorous cold front.  By tonight, moisture being
drawn northeastward from Hurricane Pamela currently about to make
landfall in western Mexico will enhance the threat heavy rain
across the southern Plains as the tropical moisture interacts with
the cold front.  An axis of 2 to 3 inches of rain with locally
higher amounts is forecast to extend from southwestern Texas
towards eastern Oklahoma.  The threat of heavy rain may extend
into Thursday night in portions of these areas as the front is
forecast to become nearly stationary.

Throughout the short-range period a large temperature contrast
will be found across the country.  High pressure locked in place
over the eastern seaboard will allow moderately above normal
temperatures to persist across the eastern US, while the storm
system out west will advect cool air south from higher latitudes,
dropping daily highs 20 to 30 degrees below average into the 30s
and 40s.  Freeze Watches and Warnings are currently in effect over
portions of the Southwest and Central Great Basin.  Meanwhile,
moisture associated with the next upper trough is moving into the
Pacific Northwest.  This system is expected to spread
high-elevation snows across the Intermountain region and into the
central Rockies during the next couple of days.

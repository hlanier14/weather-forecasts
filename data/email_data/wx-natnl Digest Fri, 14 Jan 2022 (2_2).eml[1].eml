Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 AM CST Fri Jan 14 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF TRANS-PECOS AND
PERMIAN BASIN...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough currently in the Northern Rockies will
continue southeastward today. A surface cyclone in the central High
Plains will deepen and move through the southern Plains. A fast
moving cold front, particularly within the High Plains region, will
reach the Rio Grande and lower Texas Gulf Coast by Saturday morning.

...Southern High Plains Vicinity...
Dry and windy conditions can be expected both ahead of and behind
the advancing cold front. Mid/upper-level moisture is evident on
water-vapor imagery across much of the Southwest. This moisture will
continue to move into the region ahead of the upper trough. Forecast
soundings also show this moisture and the possibility for cloud
cover. This will impact boundary-layer heating and mixing
efficiency. With the cold front, winds will rapidly shift to the
north. RH could stay around 20% for a brief time along with gusty
winds. Critical fire weather appears most likely from the Davis
Mountains into parts of the Permian Basin. There, a better signal
for RH at or just below 15% exists along with winds near 20 mph.
Critical conditions may occur locally in parts of the eastern New
Mexico into the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. However, the
negative impacts of cloud cover and RH recovery behind the front
keep the duration and spatial extent too in doubt for highlights.
Drought-impacted fuels will continue to support fire spread within
the region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 AM CST Fri Jan 14 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough within the southern Plains will slowly become
more negatively tilted on Saturday. The motion of this feature will
slowly become more easterly. Deep northwesterly winds will impact
the southern Plains.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Though temperatures will be cooler behind the cold front, subsidence
on the southern/western flank of the upper-level trough should allow
for clear skies. Boundary-layer mixing should be relatively
efficient and promote gusty winds across the region. Winds of around
20-25 mph are expected. There is some question as to how long low RH
will exist given the persistent cold air advection. At present, RH
is forecast to broadly settle to around 20% with perhaps some
locations seeing less than 20%. Locally critical conditions are most
likely within and near the Rio Grande Valley. Drought-impacted and
freeze-cured fuels will support fire growth.

...Major winter storm to lift over the Northern Mid-Atlantic/lower
Great Lakes and Northeast Monday...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles have come into closer agreement in the day
3-5 (Mon-Wed) including a major winter storm to bolster forecast
confidence. The WPC product suite this period was mainly derived
from a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian composite along with the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. WPC continuity is well maintained.

Predictabilty seems marginally above normal into days 6/7
(Thu-next Fri), but forecast spread does increase in particular
with the handling of Pacific system energies into an upper ridge
built off the West Coast. Recent ECMWF/UKMET runs bring more upper
troughing through this ridge into the Northwest than the Canadian
and especially the GFS that deflect energies more over the ridge.
Suspect ridge amplitude should hold on the more amplified side of
the full envelope of solutions given initial strength, perhaps
closest to the 06 UTC GEFS mean.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A major winter low developing over the weekend seems set to lift
from the northern Mid-Atlantic/lower Great Lakes through the
Northeast Monday. This will present a continuing full array of
weather hazards and threats. Heavy wrapping snows will spread in
earnest along/on the backside of the deepening low and west of the
I-95 corridor into interior areas given track. For locations
east/along I-95 (including the major metro areas), precipitation
may start out as accumulating snow, with a changeover to sleet
then rain as warmer air filters in from the east. Gusty winds
surrounding the surface low may create high waves off the coast
leading to possible coastal flood concerns along the Northeast
coastline.

After the main low exits northeast of the U.S. by Tuesday, another
low pressure system is forecast to track over the north-central
U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring some snow to
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes then northern New England, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain may develop
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast for mid-later
next week with modest return Gulf flow with induced wave passages.

...Major winter storm to lift over the Northern Mid-Atlantic/lower
Great Lakes and Northeast Monday...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles have come into closer agreement in the day
3-5 (Mon-Wed) including a major winter storm to bolster forecast
confidence. The WPC product suite this period was mainly derived
from a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian composite along with the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. WPC continuity is well maintained.

Predictabilty seems marginally above normal into days 6/7
(Thu-next Fri), but forecast spread does increase in particular
with the handling of Pacific system energies into an upper ridge
built off the West Coast. Recent ECMWF/UKMET runs bring more upper
troughing through this ridge into the Northwest than the Canadian
and especially the GFS that deflect energies more over the ridge.
Suspect ridge amplitude should hold on the more amplified side of
the full envelope of solutions given initial strength, perhaps
closest to the 06 UTC GEFS mean.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A major winter low developing over the weekend seems set to lift
from the northern Mid-Atlantic/lower Great Lakes through the
Northeast Monday. This will present a continuing full array of
weather hazards and threats. Heavy wrapping snows will spread in
earnest along/on the backside of the deepening low and west of the
I-95 corridor into interior areas given track. For locations
east/along I-95 (including the major metro areas), precipitation
may start out as accumulating snow, with a changeover to sleet
then rain as warmer air filters in from the east. Gusty winds
surrounding the surface low may create high waves off the coast
leading to possible coastal flood concerns along the Northeast
coastline.

After the main low exits northeast of the U.S. by Tuesday, another
low pressure system is forecast to track over the north-central
U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring some snow to
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes then northern New England, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain may develop
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast for mid-later
next week with modest return Gulf flow with induced wave passages.

...Heavy snow for parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley on
Friday...

...Snow for parts of the Lower Mississippi, Tennessee Valleys, and
Southern Appalachians on Saturday...

...Pockets of rain/freezing rain over parts of the Carolinas and
Southern Appalachians on Saturday...

On Friday, a wave of low pressure over the Central Plains will
move southward to the Lower Mississippi Valley by Saturday
morning. On Friday, the system will produce heavy snow over parts
of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley. Rain will also develop
over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley on Friday evening into
Saturday morning. The snow will result in reduced visibility and
hazardous driving conditions. Isolated pockets of rain/freezing
rain cannot be ruled out along the rain/snow line overnight Friday
into Saturday morning. The rain will expand into the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on Saturday. By Saturday evening,
the rain will change over to snow over parts of Arkansas.
Overnight Saturday, the rain will move into parts of the
Southeast, while the rain changes over to snow over parts of the
Tennessee Valley. Furthermore, snow will develop over parts of the
Central/Southern Appalachians, with pockets of rain/freezing rain
developing over the Carolinas and the Southern Appalachians
overnight Saturday into Sunday morning. The combination of snow
and ice may cause hazardous driving conditions on roads.

Meanwhile, a rapidly deepening area of low pressure off the
Carolina Coast will move northward to off the Northeast Coast by
Friday evening. With high pressure over East-Central Canada and
the deep low off the coast, strong gusty wind will develop over
parts of the Northeast from Friday afternoon into Saturday
morning. In addition, light snow will develop over parts of the
Northeast on Friday. Moderate to heavy snow will develop over
parts of southeastern Maine overnight Friday, ending on Saturday.
The snow will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving
conditions.

An upper-level low off the Southern California Coast will aid in
producing light rain over parts of Southern California on Saturday
morning into late Saturday night.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1115 AM CDT Wed Sep 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced for northeast Colorado. Morning
surface observations show RH values in the 20-40% range across the
Denver, CO area, which is under a weak downslope flow regime. The
12z DNR sounding revealed a dry boundary layer, and the LBF sounding
exhibited dry mid-level air over a shallow stratus deck that is
quickly mixing out across northeast CO per latest GOES imagery.
Northward advection of dry surface air and continued mixing should
allow for drying conditions across the northern CO Plains with RH
reductions to 15-25% by late afternoon. Moisture return from the
south will limit the spatial extent of the threat, but winds
increasing to near 20-25 mph coupled with modestly dry fuels (ERC
values above the 75th percentile) should support elevated
conditions. Rain chances will increase this evening, ending the fire
weather threat.

..Moore.. 09/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Wed Sep 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Moderately strong mid-level winds will continue across parts of the
northern Great Basin today. A surface boundary will remain stalled
in northern Nevada as the main shortwave trough lifts northeastward.
A lee trough and weak cyclone in eastern Colorado will deepen
through the day.

...Parts of central/Northern Sierra Front...
A very dry airmass was sampled by the 00Z Reno sounding. Continued
mixing of mid-level winds to the surface and an enhanced surface
pressure gradient near the boundary will promote 15-20 mph winds,
with locally higher speeds, along the lee of the central/northern
Sierra. RH in the single digits will be possible, but 10-15% will be
more common. Elevated to locally critical fire weather concerns are
expected.

...Central High Plains...
A strong wind field should lead to 20+ mph winds across the region
during the afternoon. Some guidance, particularly those with a dry
bias, show elevated fire weather occurring along and near the
Kansas-Colorado border. Given the intensifying south-southwesterly
flow aloft and the expected quick moisture advection at low levels,
it seems unlikely that these conditions will occur broadly or for
any substantial duration. Local/brief elevated conditions are still
possible. No highlights will be added this outlook.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

During the medium range period, the upper level pattern is
forecast to evolve toward upper troughing over the Great Lakes
region and East Coast while ridging builds over the Southwest U.S.
into the Northern Rockies. As a result, periodic shortwave troughs
and associated fronts moving through the flow will parade through
the central and eastern U.S.. Finally, by day 6 and day 7, a
shortwave trough will approach the Pacific Northwest. Overall, the
model guidance is average to above average agreement and
consistency from previous cycles and this leads to some higher
forecast confidence. The main issues are tied with the
amplification of troughing over the Great Lakes as well as the
progression of shortwave energy dropping into the Pacific
Northwest where the 06Z GFS was on the faster side of the model
spread. Given the relatively good agreement, the WPC blend
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS near equally for
days 3-5 then higher weights of the ECENS/GEFS means for days 6-7.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states into next midweek in response to
upper trough amplification.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

During the medium range period, the upper level pattern is
forecast to evolve toward upper troughing over the Great Lakes
region and East Coast while ridging builds over the Southwest U.S.
into the Northern Rockies. As a result, periodic shortwave troughs
and associated fronts moving through the flow will parade through
the central and eastern U.S.. Finally, by day 6 and day 7, a
shortwave trough will approach the Pacific Northwest. Overall, the
model guidance is average to above average agreement and
consistency from previous cycles and this leads to some higher
forecast confidence. The main issues are tied with the
amplification of troughing over the Great Lakes as well as the
progression of shortwave energy dropping into the Pacific
Northwest where the 06Z GFS was on the faster side of the model
spread. Given the relatively good agreement, the WPC blend
incorporated the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS near equally for
days 3-5 then higher weights of the ECENS/GEFS means for days 6-7.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states into next midweek in response to
upper trough amplification.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 011819
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to persist over the south-
central
U.S. through the second week of September which increases the chances of a
late
summer heat wave for that region. Meanwhile, a pattern change is expected
across the Pacific Northwest and northern California with mid-level low
pressure developing later next week. Mid-level low pressure centered over the
Bering Sea is expected to bring periods of precipitation to much of Mainland
Alaska during early to mid-September.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Southern Great Plains, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Thu-Mon, Sep 9-13.

Slight risk of heavy rain for the Lower Rio Grande Valley and parts of the
Texas Gulf Coast, Thu-Fri, Sep 9-10.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and
California, Thu-Sat, Sep 9-11.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 04 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tWsdlYVoUKljKo2U0nFzl663PdXw_xPMhSWXLx4tQt_jnnKrnbTNziPW2zZ4XvqSlLewxQa1$

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 09 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 15: Ensemble means depict
anomalous subtropical ridging (500-hPa heights of 588 to 592 dm) for early to
mid-September persisting over the south-central U.S. through week-2.
Therefore,
above normal temperatures are likely across the Lower Mississippi Valley where
power outages remain widespread in the wake of Hurricane Ida. Based on the
predicted longwave pattern and various temperature tools, a slight risk of
excessive heat is posted for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southern
Great Plains through Sep 13. Heat index values are forecast to be near or
above
105 degrees F in the outlined hazard area. Anomalously warm temperatures
(highs
in the lower 90s) are also likely for eastern Colorado during early week-2,
but
heat advisory thresholds are not expected to be reached at this time.



An area of low pressure is currently located in the southwestern Caribbean Sea
and slow tropical cyclone (TC) development may occur either across the western
Caribbean Sea or southwestern Gulf of Mexico during the next week. Since a
majority of model solutions have backed off on this potential TC tracking
north, the slight risk of heavy rainfall for the western Gulf Coast was
reduced
in spatial coverage. Early in week-2, the most likely area for heavy rainfall
is the Lower Rio Grande Valley and parts of the Texas Gulf Coast, where the
slight risk remains on Sep 9 and 10. Chances for TC development are expected
to
increase across the East Pacific by week-2 which could eventually lead to a
renewed flash flooding risk for the Southwest during mid-September.



Major Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Aug 30.
Heavy to excessive rainfall (6 to 15 inches, or more) accompanied Ida as it
tracked inland across southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result,
moderate to major river flooding is ongoing across the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Moderate flooding is forecast along the Potomac River in the
Mid-Atlantic during the next 48 to 72 hours. Since most river levels are
expected to fall into the minor flood stage or lower across these areas by the
beginning of week-2, a flooding hazard is not depicted on the map. Please
refer
to local NWS offices for the latest flooding updates.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldron Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned nearly
200,000 acres and is only 16% contained. As a 500-hPa trough shifts eastward
into the western U.S., there is an increasing chance of gusty winds across
California, the Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin during the early part of
week-2. Based on good model agreement on an amplified trough shifting inland
into the western U.S. and surface wind forecasts from recent deterministic GFS
model runs, a slight risk of high winds is posted for parts of the West for
Sep
9 to 11, which coincides where more than a dozen large wildfires are ongoing.

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Northwest will slowly being to
move east on Thursday. Mid-level winds across the Great Basin will
be on the decline. The surface boundary in Nevada will remain
relatively stationary. The overall fire weather pattern will not
favor significant concerns.

...Nevada...
The surface pressure gradient near the boundary and modest mid-level
winds may promote locally elevated conditions near and behind the
boundary across central Nevada. Given the marginal winds and
duration of the conditions, no highlights will be added.

...Willamette Valley into southwest Oregon...
A subtle setup for north/northeasterly winds will occur as the
upper-level trough shifts to the east during the afternoon and weak
high pressure moves into Washington. Both the surface pressure
gradient and the upper-level winds will be weak, but dry fuels would
support locally elevated conditions where winds can reach 15 mph and
downslope drying reduces RH to near or below 20%.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed September 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 07 - 11 2021

Dynamical models are in good agreement regarding an amplified 500-hPa
circulation pattern forecast over North America during the 6-10 day period. An
amplified trough is predicted to the west of Alaska over the Bering Sea. A
trough to the south of Alaska over the northeastern Pacific in the 6-10 day
period is predicted to progress eastward towards the Pacific Coast of the
CONUS. Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of
southern and eastern Mainland Alaska in the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means,
with
greater positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the ECMWF and GFS high resolution
runs. A ridge and above normal mid-level heights are predicted over the
western
CONUS, while an amplified trough and below normal heights are predicted over
the eastern CONUS.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored over western Mainland Alaska,
due
to potential increased cloudiness ahead of a predicted trough, while above
normal temperatures are more likely for the Aleutians and much of eastern
Mainland Alaska, supported by the temperature consolidation and most dynamical
model temperature forecast tools. Near normal temperatures are favored over
the
Alaska Panhandle, with increased uncertainty ahead of an eastward progressing
trough. Above normal temperatures are likely for the western CONUS, from the
Pacific coast to western areas of the Northern Plains and across the Southern
Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley, under a predicted ridge. Near to
below normal temperatures are favored for most of the eastern CONUS, under a
predicted trough. Above normal temperatures are favored for the Atlantic coast
of New England and parts of the Southeast, with anomalously southerly flow
ahead of a predicted trough and supported by the temperature consolidation
tool.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored for the Aleutians and western
Mainland Alaska, ahead of a predicted trough. Below normal precipitation is
favored for eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool. Near to above normal precipitation is
favored
for much of the western CONUS, ahead of the approaching trough and supported
by
the precipitation consolidation. Below normal precipitation is favored  for
most of the central CONUS to the east of the Great Divide, under a predicted
ridge. Probabilities for below normal precipitation are enhanced for the Ohio
Valley and the Southeast, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.
Near to above normal precipitation is likely for much of the Northeast, ahead
of a predicted trough. Differences among the precipitation tools for the
western and central Gulf Coast states lead to a forecast of near normal
precipitation for this area.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on
Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 09 - 15 2021

With increasing uncertainty and ensemble spread, a generally low amplitude
mid-level circulation pattern is forecast across North America during week-2
by
the manual blend of 500-hPa height forecasts. However, large-scale features
resemble the 6-10 day period forecasts, as do temperature and precipitation
tools. A less amplified trough is forecast to the west of Alaska in most model
solutions. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the North
Pacific and the Alaska Panhandle in the week-2 period, as a predicted trough
progresses eastward into the western CONUS. Weak ridging and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies are forecast over the central CONUS, while a trough and
slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies persist over the eastern CONUS.

While there is an increase in uncertainty in the week-2 period, the predicted
temperature and precipitation patterns in week-2 are generally similar to the
6-10 day period forecasts, with somewhat lower probabilities. Near to below
normal temperatures are favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska ahead of
a
predicted trough, while above normal temperatures are favored for the
Aleutians
and eastern Mainland Alaska, supported by the temperature consolidation tool.
Below normal temperatures are favored for the Pacific Northwest, under a
predicted trough. Above normal temperatures are likely for the Southwest and
the central CONUS, under a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above
normal temperatures are more likely over the Great Lakes region in week-2,
relative to the 6-10 day period, as mid-level heights are predicted to rise.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored for the Tennessee and  Ohio
Valleys, the Mid-Atlantic, and parts of the Northeast, under a persistent
trough. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Southeast and
New England Atlantic coasts, supported by the temperature consolidation tool.

Enhanced chances of above normal precipitation continue for parts of western
Mainland Alaska, ahead of a predicted trough. Near normal precipitation is
favored for the Aleutians as well as southern and eastern Mainland Alaska,
with
uncertainty in a changing circulation pattern. Below normal precipitation is
favored for the Alaska Panhandle, under increasing positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. With increasing uncertainty in the forecast for week-2, near normal
precipitation is favored for much of the Great Lakes and Northeast regions.
Below normal precipitation is likely for the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and
the
Southeast, supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement on the circulation pattern, offset by weak 500-hPa anomalies in
the manual blend with increasing uncertainty in the circulation pattern, and
differences among temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to persist over the south-
central
U.S. through the second week of September which increases the chances of a
late
summer heat wave for that region. Meanwhile, a pattern change is expected
across the Pacific Northwest and northern California with mid-level low
pressure developing later next week. Mid-level low pressure centered over the
Bering Sea is expected to bring periods of precipitation to much of Mainland
Alaska during early to mid-September.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Southern Great Plains, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, Thu-Mon, Sep 9-13.

Slight risk of heavy rain for the Lower Rio Grande Valley and parts of the
Texas Gulf Coast, Thu-Fri, Sep 9-10.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and
California, Thu-Sat, Sep 9-11.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 04 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!olf9r6mnYi7SyZaxHkQIGIm7LJ5bElZByyoRhMNCUB1htuO6jS5BWOtZ_F5oO99ewb1z2Kjo$

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 09 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 15: Ensemble means depict
anomalous subtropical ridging (500-hPa heights of 588 to 592 dm) for early to
mid-September persisting over the south-central U.S. through week-2.
Therefore,
above normal temperatures are likely across the Lower Mississippi Valley where
power outages remain widespread in the wake of Hurricane Ida. Based on the
predicted longwave pattern and various temperature tools, a slight risk of
excessive heat is posted for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southern
Great Plains through Sep 13. Heat index values are forecast to be near or
above
105 degrees F in the outlined hazard area. Anomalously warm temperatures
(highs
in the lower 90s) are also likely for eastern Colorado during early week-2,
but
heat advisory thresholds are not expected to be reached at this time.



An area of low pressure is currently located in the southwestern Caribbean Sea
and slow tropical cyclone (TC) development may occur either across the western
Caribbean Sea or southwestern Gulf of Mexico during the next week. Since a
majority of model solutions have backed off on this potential TC tracking
north, the slight risk of heavy rainfall for the western Gulf Coast was
reduced
in spatial coverage. Early in week-2, the most likely area for heavy rainfall
is the Lower Rio Grande Valley and parts of the Texas Gulf Coast, where the
slight risk remains on Sep 9 and 10. Chances for TC development are expected
to
increase across the East Pacific by week-2 which could eventually lead to a
renewed flash flooding risk for the Southwest during mid-September.



Major Hurricane Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Aug 30.
Heavy to excessive rainfall (6 to 15 inches, or more) accompanied Ida as it
tracked inland across southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result,
moderate to major river flooding is ongoing across the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Moderate flooding is forecast along the Potomac River in the
Mid-Atlantic during the next 48 to 72 hours. Since most river levels are
expected to fall into the minor flood stage or lower across these areas by the
beginning of week-2, a flooding hazard is not depicted on the map. Please
refer
to local NWS offices for the latest flooding updates.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldor
Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned nearly 200,000
acres and is only 16% contained. As a 500-hPa trough shifts eastward into the
western U.S., there is an increasing chance of gusty winds across California,
the Pacific Northwest, and Great Basin during the early part of week-2. Based
on good model agreement on an amplified trough shifting inland into the
western
U.S. and surface wind forecasts from recent deterministic GFS model runs, a
slight risk of high winds is posted for parts of the West for Sep 9 to 11,
which coincides where more than a dozen large wildfires are ongoing.

...Post Tropical Cyclone Ida soaking northern Mid Atlantic and
southern New England with a High Risk of excessive rainfall posted
into early Thursday morning, life threatening flooding and severe
weather expected...

...Rounds of severe storms and a risk of flash flooding is
possible in the Great Plains and Midwest, localized flash flooding
possible in the Southwest...

...Sultry conditions on tap in the South Central U.S., seasonally
cooler conditions across the northern tier; favorable fire weather
conditions persist in parts of California and western Nevada; poor
air quality sticks around in the West...

Post Tropical Cyclone Ida is producing significant impacts
throughout the northern Mid-Atlantic this afternoon with
widespread areas of flash flooding and severe weather. A High Risk
for Excessive Rainfall remains in place from southern Pennsylvania
to southern New England. Life threatening flooding may occur where
copious amounts of rainfall accumulate this afternoon and evening
with stream and river flooding potentially lingering into
Thursday. The flash flood threat coincides with favorable
conditions for severe weather within the warm sector of Ida. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk from the
DC/Baltimore metro areas and the northern DelMarVa Peninsula to
the Lower Delaware Valley and New Jersey coast. Post Tropical
Cyclone Ida will track northeast through the overnight hours
focusing its most intense area of rainfall over eastern
Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, and across southern New
England. Rainfall totals over 6 inches are expected with some
localized areas receiving over 10 inches by the time Ida races
into the northwest Atlantic Thursday morning. The good news-- high
pressure arrives in Ida's wake ushering in drier and seasonally
cooler temperatures for the latter half of the work-week.

The northern Mid-Atlantic and southern New England are not the
only regions witnessing eventful weather this afternoon.
Strong-to-severe thunderstorms are forecast to track across the
northern Plains. A Slight Risk for severe storms is in place for
parts of South Dakota and northwest Nebraska today as a wave of
low pressure approaches from the northern High Plains. This
frontal system reaches the Midwest on Thursday where heavy
rainfall rates may lead to areas of flash flooding. For this
reason, a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for
portions of the Upper Midwest and Central Plains. This front will
slowly inch southward by Friday focusing the next threat for
strong thunderstorms and potential flash flooding over the central
Plains. In the Southwest, remnant moisture from Nora continue to
aid in the development of heavy showers and thunderstorms that
could lead to flash flooding in spots this evening. A Slight Risk
is in place for much of the Four Corners region with Arizona,
western New Mexico, and southern Utah most at risk for flash
flooding.

Temperature-wise, much of the Lower 48 will get a reprieve from
oppressively hot conditions as below normal high temps engulf much
of the northern U.S. and both the Southwest and Southeast. As the
calendar flips over to September, a brief push of September-like
temperatures and comfy humidity levels arrive in the Ohio Valley,
central Appalachians, and Northeast through Friday. The hottest
portion of the country through Friday evening will be the Southern
Plains where daytime high temps routinely soar into the mid-upper
90s. Heat indices are forecast to range between 105-110 degrees in
these areas, prompting the issuance of Heat Advisories for much of
the South Central U.S.. Additionally, there is a fire weather
threat the northern Sierra Nevada and in the Reno/Carson City area
as Red Flag Warnings have been issued in these areas. Air Quality
Alerts have also been posted in parts of the Pacific Northwest and
both the northern and central Rockies due to wildfire smoke.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 AM CDT Thu Sep 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Northwest will shift to the east
today. Northerly mid-level winds will be situated in western
Oregon/Washington. Mid-level winds will weaken across the northern
Great Basin. At the surface, weak high pressure will move into the
northern Rockies. A surface boundary in northern Nevada may slowly
sag farther southward into central Nevada during the day.

Locally elevated fire weather may develop near the surface boundary
in Nevada, but conditions will not be widespread and fuels become
less receptive from central Nevada southward.

Locally elevated conditions are also possible within the Willamette
Valley into southwest Oregon as north/northeasterly winds impact the
area. Though RH could fall below 20% in some locations, the general
weakness of the pressure gradient should keep most winds below 15
mph.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Thu Sep 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough will shift into the northern Plains on
Friday. Flow aloft will remain weak across areas with the driest
fuels. The surface pressure pattern will also be rather diffuse
across the West and into the Plains. Fire weather concerns are
expected to be minimal across the CONUS.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on the
larger scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium range
period for much of the nation, but still struggle with smaller
scale individual features, especially next week. The WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend
of reasonably well clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET along with the compatible 01 UTC National Blend of
Models for days 3-5 (Sunday-Tuesday). This blend has broad
ensemble support despite the lingering small scale variances,
bolstering forecast confidence. Forecast spread grows enough into
days 6/7 (Wednesday/next Thursday) to favor a blend of the
compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and best clustered model
guidance from the 12 UTC ECMWF. This composite builds overall
east-central U.S. upper trough amplitude on the higher side of the
full forecast envelope (GFS less amplified). This seems more
reasonable considering expected upstream ridge building and
growing warmth over much of the the West ahead of Pacific upper
trough translation. This maintains reasonably good WPC continuity
in line with newer 00 UTC guidance. WPC progs also take into
account latest NHC guidance that limits Bay of Campeche to western
Gulf of Mexico tropical system development next week due to
unfavorable upper level winds. Recent Canadian runs have been
especially zealous.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states through next midweek in response
to planned upper trough amplification.

across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states through next midweek in response
to planned upper trough amplification.

...Post-Tropical Cyclone IDA is forecast to move northeastward
into Canada...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Upper Midwest into the Central Plains through Friday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
Central Plains through Friday morning...

Post-Tropical Cyclone IDA is forecast to be over New England on
Thursday morning. The system has become extratropical on the Phase
diagram and the flooding threat will slowly end.  What was IDA
will move off the Northeast Coast, also on Thursday morning,
moving into the Canadian Maritime Provinces by Thursday evening.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern Plains westward to
the Great Basin will move eastward into the Upper Mississippi
Valley and dissipate by Friday morning. Moisture pooling along the
front and upper-level energy will produce showers and
thunderstorms over the Upper Midwest into the Southern High
Plains. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Friday
morning. Furthermore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central Plains through Friday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.  The excessive rainfall threat will continue on
Friday into Saturday morning over parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley/Central Plains with a smaller area over parts of the
Northern High Plains. Conversely, the severe thunderstorms threat
will decrease slightly on Friday into Saturday.

Elsewhere, moisture and upper-level energy will produce showers
and thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Rockies and Southern
High Plains during the late afternoon into the late evening on
Thursday and Friday.  The fire weather threat has subsided over
the Western part of the country. However, Air Quality Alerts have
also been published over parts of the Pacific Northwest and
California and parts of Wyoming and Montana due to wildfire smoke.
 There are also Heat Advisories out for parts of the Southern
Plains and the Lower Mississippi Valley.

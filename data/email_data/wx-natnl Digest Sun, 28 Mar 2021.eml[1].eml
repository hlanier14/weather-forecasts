..Bentley.. 03/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0209 AM CDT Sat Mar 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move from the Southwest into the
Southern Plains today. A weak surface low is forecast to move across
TX as a cold front moves through portions of the southern Rockies
and High Plains.

...Southeast NM into West TX...
Relatively strong westerly winds are expected to develop this
afternoon from extreme southeast NM into west TX, in advance of the
cold frontal passage. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher)
in conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20% will result in a
threat of elevated fire weather conditions, with locally critical
conditions possible. The threat across the northern portion of the
Elevated area may end relatively early as the cold front moves
through.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
229 PM EDT Sat Mar 27 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 30 2021 - 12Z Sat Apr 03 2021

...Overview...

A rather amplified mid-upper pattern is expected across the CONUS
next week as a sizable longwave trough moves west to east across
the country, pushing a potent cold front across the central and
eastern U.S. Tuesday through Thursday. Precipitation should spread
ahead of those features, with the possibility of some snow in the
interior Northeast. Surface high pressure is forecast to move in
behind the cold front, drying out much of the country by Friday,
though another upper-level trough approaching the Northwest could
bring renewed moisture there by late next week.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

00Z/06Z model guidance clustered well with the synoptic-scale
pattern next week--deterministic and ensemble guidance shows good
agreement for the aforementioned upper trough with not too many
significant differences in position and timing especially early in
the period, enhancing forecast confidence. By Friday into
Saturday, models have trended in the direction of pivoting the
troughing/energy northward into Canada with less influence over
the CONUS, but there is still some uncertainty with that, with the
GFS suite more aggressive in retreating the energy compared to the
ECMWF/CMC suites. This affects the surface frontal position as
well, with a front moving faster through the Northeast compared to
the previous forecast. The general idea of upper ridging coming in
behind this trough also appears well-predicted. With the upper
trough tracking through the northeastern Pacific late in the week,
there is some variability in its strength and orientation along
with its surface low, but a blend of guidance seemed to suffice
there. Additionally, a small piece of energy moving eastward
across the Pacific midweek making its way into Southern California
Friday was agreeable among models, with the exception of the 00Z
CMC that had a much weaker, faster feature there. Overall, was
able to use a deterministic blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z
ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for the first half of the period, with the
addition of the GEFS and EC ensemble means as the UKMET dropped
out and lessening the CMC influence.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

After some showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast Tuesday with
a small southern stream disturbance, the potential for
precipitation will increase for the eastern part of the U.S. on
Wednesday as Gulf of Mexico moisture streams in ahead of the upper
trough and in the vicinity of the cold front. Heavy rainfall is
possible, which may be centered near the Southern Appalachians,
but model guidance does vary regarding the axis of the heaviest
rain. Farther north in the Appalachians and into the interior
Northeast, precipitation could start as rain but transition to
snow. Snowfall amounts are yet to be determined at this point.

Behind the cold front, dry conditions are forecast, and
temperatures that are cooler than normal by 10-20 degrees are
expected to track across the country from the Rockies and central
U.S. Tuesday-Wednesday into the eastern U.S. Thursday-Friday.
Additionally, high/gusty winds are possible, particularly in the
north-central U.S. on Tuesday given a tight pressure gradient.
Then, the upper-level ridge in the central U.S. will help build in
warmer than average temperatures for much of the western and
central U.S., with temperatures in the 70s reaching as far north
as the Dakotas. Elsewhere, precipitation is expected to increase
for the Northwest by Friday and Saturday as a front passes through
and the next upper trough approaches.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
229 PM EDT Sat Mar 27 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 30 2021 - 12Z Sat Apr 03 2021

...Overview...

A rather amplified mid-upper pattern is expected across the CONUS
next week as a sizable longwave trough moves west to east across
the country, pushing a potent cold front across the central and
eastern U.S. Tuesday through Thursday. Precipitation should spread
ahead of those features, with the possibility of some snow in the
interior Northeast. Surface high pressure is forecast to move in
behind the cold front, drying out much of the country by Friday,
though another upper-level trough approaching the Northwest could
bring renewed moisture there by late next week.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

00Z/06Z model guidance clustered well with the synoptic-scale
pattern next week--deterministic and ensemble guidance shows good
agreement for the aforementioned upper trough with not too many
significant differences in position and timing especially early in
the period, enhancing forecast confidence. By Friday into
Saturday, models have trended in the direction of pivoting the
troughing/energy northward into Canada with less influence over
the CONUS, but there is still some uncertainty with that, with the
GFS suite more aggressive in retreating the energy compared to the
ECMWF/CMC suites. This affects the surface frontal position as
well, with a front moving faster through the Northeast compared to
the previous forecast. The general idea of upper ridging coming in
behind this trough also appears well-predicted. With the upper
trough tracking through the northeastern Pacific late in the week,
there is some variability in its strength and orientation along
with its surface low, but a blend of guidance seemed to suffice
there. Additionally, a small piece of energy moving eastward
across the Pacific midweek making its way into Southern California
Friday was agreeable among models, with the exception of the 00Z
CMC that had a much weaker, faster feature there. Overall, was
able to use a deterministic blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z
ECMWF/UKMET/CMC for the first half of the period, with the
addition of the GEFS and EC ensemble means as the UKMET dropped
out and lessening the CMC influence.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

After some showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast Tuesday with
a small southern stream disturbance, the potential for
precipitation will increase for the eastern part of the U.S. on
Wednesday as Gulf of Mexico moisture streams in ahead of the upper
trough and in the vicinity of the cold front. Heavy rainfall is
possible, which may be centered near the Southern Appalachians,
but model guidance does vary regarding the axis of the heaviest
rain. Farther north in the Appalachians and into the interior
Northeast, precipitation could start as rain but transition to
snow. Snowfall amounts are yet to be determined at this point.

Behind the cold front, dry conditions are forecast, and
temperatures that are cooler than normal by 10-20 degrees are
expected to track across the country from the Rockies and central
U.S. Tuesday-Wednesday into the eastern U.S. Thursday-Friday.
Additionally, high/gusty winds are possible, particularly in the
north-central U.S. on Tuesday given a tight pressure gradient.
Then, the upper-level ridge in the central U.S. will help build in
warmer than average temperatures for much of the western and
central U.S., with temperatures in the 70s reaching as far north
as the Dakotas. Elsewhere, precipitation is expected to increase
for the Northwest by Friday and Saturday as a front passes through
and the next upper trough approaches.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat March 27 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL/EASTERN
MONTANA INTO WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA AND NORTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA...

Expanded the critical area and elevated areas to account for the
latest forecast guidance. The forecast appears on track with winds
15 to 25 mph and relative humidity ranging from 12 to 25 percent.

Very dry and windy conditions are also expected in portions of
eastern Oregon. However, fuels are still quite moist in this region.
Therefore, localized increased initial attack is possible, but
overall a large-fire threat is not anticipated.

..Bentley.. 03/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0212 AM CDT Sat Mar 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move eastward and amplify over the
Northwest and northern Rockies on Sunday, as the downstream upper
trough moves quickly eastward to the Eastern seaboard by Monday
morning. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the lee of the
Canadian Rockies and begin moving eastward across the Canadian
Prairies by Sunday evening.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...
Strengthening westerly flow will spread across most of MT into the
western Dakotas on Sunday, in advance of the approaching upper
trough and to the south of the deepening surface cyclone, with
sustained winds of 15-25 mph (with higher gusts) expected by
afternoon. Guidance shows the typical spread with respect to the
magnitude of mixing/drying within this regime, but generally agrees
that RH values will fall into the 15-30% range as temperatures
increase into the 60s F. These conditions will result in relatively
large area of elevated fire weather conditions. Within this area,
critical conditions will be possible. A critical delineation has
been included where confidence is currently highest in meeting
wind/RH criteria, though some expansion of this area is certainly
possible in subsequent outlooks.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms and a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys through Sunday morning...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and a Slight Risk of excecive rainfall over parts
of the Tennessee/North Carolina border on Sunday into Monday
morning...

...Strong cold front to bring gusty winds and heavy mountain snow
across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies beginning Sunday
afternoon...

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes southwestward to the
Southern Plains will move off the East Coast overnight Sunday.
The system will produce showers and thunderstorms along and ahead
of the boundary from parts of the Southern Plains eastward to the
Mid-Atlantic through Sunday morning. Associated with the system,
rain and snow will develop over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley and the Upper Great Lakes through Sunday evening.  The SPC
has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys through Sunday
morning.  The primary hazards associated with the severe
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe wind gusts, hail, and
tornadoes.  SPC believes there will be a 10% or greater
probability of EF2-EF5 tornadoes, severe wind gust 65 knots or
greater, and two-inch hail in the enhanced region.  The WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys through Sunday morning.
The heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms will produce
numerous areas of flash flooding.  Some significant flooding is
possible and many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger
rivers.

On Sunday, showers and thunderstorms will continue along and ahead
of the front from the Mid-Atlantic to the Central Gulf Coast until
the front moves off the coast overnight Sunday.  The SPC has
issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic through to when the front moves offshore or Monday
morning.  The primary hazards associated with the severe
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe wind gusts, hail, and
tornadoes.  SPC believes there will be a 10% chance of severe wind
gust 65 knots or greater in the enhanced region.  There will still
be heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms, but the flooding
threat will be lower with a Sight Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Tennessee/North Carolina border.  Additionally, the
rain will move into parts of the Northeast and Ohio Valley and
then into the northern Mid-Atlantic. The rain will change over to
snow on the backside of the precipitation shield over parts of the
Northeast into parts of the Central Appalachians from Sunday
afternoon into Monday morning.

Meanwhile, on Sunday, a front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest and advance eastward to the Upper Mississippi Valley
southwestward to the Central Rockies by Monday evening.  The
strong cold front associated and the deepening area of low
pressure in South-Central Canada will bring the threat of damaging
wind gusts and heavy mountain snow.  Snowfall amounts are expected
to exceed one foot across parts of the Cascade Mountains.  Winter
Storm Watches and Winter Weather Advisories have been posted. The
most widespread hazard, beginning Sunday, will be from gusty winds
that extend from the Pacific Northwest through the Northern Great
Basin/Rockies and into the Northern High Plains. High Wind Watches
have been issued due to the potential for wind gusts to top 60
mph. This could lead to downed trees and power lines, as well as
difficult travel for high-profile vehicles through Monday morning.
 On Monday, light snow will develop across parts of the Northern
Rockies through Monday evening.

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN MONTANA...FAR WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...AND FAR NORTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough positioned over the central CONUS this morning
will quickly shift east. In its wake, a mid-level short-wave trough
will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies,
accompanied by enhanced 70-90 kt mid-level flow along the base of
the trough. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis will occur across
portions of Alberta throughout the day, and a cold front will enter
portions of the Pacific Northwest by this evening into the
overnight.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...
As enhanced mid-level flow overspreads the region, diurnal heating
and mixing processes will result in downward-directed momentum
transfer and strong flow into the boundary layer. This process, in
combination with the developing surface low farther north and
strengthening pressure gradient, should yield sustained winds of
15-25 mph during the afternoon, with gusts to 35-45 mph. In
addition, a strong westerly downslope component to the low-level
flow will aid in surface temperatures warming into the 60s F to near
70 F, while RH values fall into the teens. Fuels across the region
have become increasingly receptive to large-fire spread due to a
lack of precipitation recently. Thus, elevated to critical
fire-weather conditions appear likely to develop across the region
today.

The previous elevated and critical areas have been expanded to the
northwest, into portions of north-central Montana. Mid-level flow in
this area will be a bit stronger and under greater influence of the
approaching mid-level trough, as compared to areas farther east.
These adjustments were made in consideration of local terrain
features that will support the aforementioned enhancements to the
surface conditions. A minor southeastward expansion was also made to
the elevated area based on the latest high-resolution guidance.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN COLORADO INTO THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A potent mid-level short-wave trough located over the Pacific
Northwest at the start of the forecast period will shift eastward
while undergoing amplification. A broad region of enhanced mid-level
flow will overspread much of the northern/central/southern High
Plains and extend into the northern Great Plains by late in the
period. At the surface, a cold front will move from the Northern
Rockies into the Northern Plains.

...Eastern Colorado into the Southern High Plains...
Diurnally driven heating/mixing processes will allow strong
southwesterly surface winds to develop, sustained near 20-30 mph.
Downsloping low-level flow will aid in compressional heating and
increasing temperature/dew point spreads, yielding RH values of
10-20%. Fuels across the region appear somewhat marginally conducive
to large-fire spread, although conditions on Day 1/Sunday may
promote additional drying, particularly among fine fuels.
Nevertheless, these conditions should yield critical fire-weather
conditions across the region.

... Northern Plains...
Elevated fire-weather conditions appear likely, in association with
pre-/post-frontal conditions, and a strengthening surface pressure
gradient in association with a maturing cyclone over portions of
southern Canada. Pre-frontal conditions will be characterized by
sustained southwesterly winds of 15-20 mph and RH values into the
teens. Behind the front, sustained northwesterly winds will be a bit
stronger, near 20-30 mph, with similar RH values resulting from the
drier post-frontal airmass despite slightly cooler temperatures, at
least for a brief period. Refinements were made to the elevated area
(converted from the 40% probability delineation) based on the latest
high-resolution guidance, and further refinements may be needed
based on the position of the frontal boundary in forthcoming
guidance.

...Overall Weather Pattern...

An amplified upper level flow pattern is expected to be in place
through the end of the week across the central and eastern U.S.
with a deep upper level trough in place across the Great Lakes and
the Northeast.  At the surface, a strong cold front will be
exiting the East Coast Thursday morning, with a much colder
airmass arriving as a large Canadian surface high builds in east
of the Rockies.  The next frontal boundary arrives for the
northwestern U.S. and northern Plains by next weekend, although
likely to be weaker given less upper level support, and little in
the way of precipitation.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in very good overall agreement
through Thursday owing to the amplified pattern in place.  For the
second half of the forecast period, forecast confidence is lower
for this time period compared to yesterday.  Across the eastern
U.S., there was good clustering with the UKMET/CMC/ECMWF for the
upper trough/closed low and these solutions were slower than the
GFS, so greater weighting was given for these three solutions.
Model differences are considerably more pronounced by next Sunday
across the eastern Pacific and West Coast region in regards to the
next storm system approaching the coast, and here an ensemble mean
approach works best until solutions come into better agreement.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The most active portion of the medium range period will be on
Wednesday and into early Thursday as the strong cold front
approaches the East Coast.  Moist southerly flow will result in
widespread showers and thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast
to the Mid-Atlantic region, and heavy rain for the Northeast
states on Wednesday/Wednesday night.  Some locations may get on
the order of 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, and some minor flooding is
possible where multiple rounds of heavy showers/storms affect the
same region.  Strong cold air advection in the wake of the
departing storm system will likely lead to a changeover to snow
for interior portions of New England and upstate New York by
Thursday morning, with several inches of accumulation possible
from the Adirondacks to northern Maine.  Elsewhere, little in the
way of organized precipitation is expected across much of the
continental U.S. for the Friday-Sunday time period as sprawling
high pressure governs the overall weather pattern, with the
exception of increasing rain/snow chances for western Washington
and Oregon as the next storm system slowly approaches that region.

With the exception of briefly warmer weather across the East Coast
region on Wednesday, temperatures will be more reminiscent of late
February for much of the eastern half of the nation to close out
the work week with blustery conditions, and subfreezing low
temperatures likely reaching as far south as northern Georgia and
South Carolina by Friday morning.  The cold weather will abate
going into the weekend as the airmass modifies and the upper level
trough lifts out across eastern Canada.  Warmer weather will
return to much of the central and western U.S. in time for the
weekend as an upper level ridge builds in and results in readings
of 10 to potentially 20 degrees above normal.

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain possible today across the
southern Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic...

...Strong cold front to bring gusty winds and heavy mountain snow
across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies over the next
few days...

...High winds and a Critical Risk of fire weather found across the
Northern High Plains today and Southern High Plains on Monday...

A low pressure system located over the Upper Great Lakes this
morning and a trailing cold front will be the focus for active
weather across the Eastern U.S. today.  Heavy rain overnight and
this morning has led to numerous flash flood reports and water
rescues across Tennessee. Flash Flood Watches and Warnings remain
in effect. The threat of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms will
shift east and into the southern Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic by
midday. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted southeast
Virginia and far northeast North Carolina as having the best
chance for severe weather. Damaging wind gusts and isolated
tornadoes will be the main concern across the region. Locally
heavy rain may also lead to flash flooding across the southern
Appalachians. Farther north, moderate rain and isolated
thunderstorms will swing through the Northeast this evening. Rain
could mix with snow across far northern New England. As the cold
front exits into the Atlantic Ocean on Monday, chilly temperatures
and gusty winds will enter the region, as well as light snow
showers for the Interior Northeast.

Meanwhile, a strong cold front is also set to impact the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Rockies, and Northern High Plains today before
quickly pushing into the Southern Plains by Tuesday morning. Heavy
mountain snow will be found across the Cascades of Washington and
Oregon, the Clearwater region of Idaho, as well as northwest
Montana. Specific snowfall totals of 1 to 2 feet are possible
across the higher elevations in Washington, where Winter Storm
Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories have been issued. However,
the most widespread hazard associated with this system will be
high winds that are forecast to impact a large area from the
Northwest to High Plains. Wind gusts up to 60 mph are possible and
could bring down power lines and trees. Winds of this magnitude
can also make travel very dangerous for high profile vehicles.
High Wind Warnings and Watches have been issued. Across the High
Plains, the combination of gusty winds, warm temperatures, and low
relative humidity will make conditions ripe for wild fires to
spread uncontrollably. SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire
weather for much of eastern Montana and far western North Dakota
today. The fire weather threat then shifts south and into eastern
Colorado and the southern High Plains on Monday. Red Flag Warnings
and Fire Weather Watches have been posted from Montana to New
Mexico.

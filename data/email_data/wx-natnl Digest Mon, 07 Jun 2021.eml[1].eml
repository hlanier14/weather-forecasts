Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Sun Jun 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

An expansion of the elevated area was made across the northern Great
Plains, covering much of northeast Montana and
northwest/north-central North Dakota. Sustained winds of 20-25 mph,
gusting to near 40 mph, should occur while RH values generally
remain above critical thresholds. Localized critical conditions are
also possible despite recent wetting rains over much of the region.
Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains on track. See the
discussion below for more information.

..Karstens.. 06/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Sun Jun 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad Pacific Northwest upper-level trough is forecast to persist
over the Eastern Pacific Ocean through today, as an embedded
short-wave trough along its southern/eastern periphery gradually
weakens while shifting onshore. An associated belt of stronger
mid-level westerly flow is forecast along/near the base of the
large-scale trough from Oregon/Northern California northeastward to
North Dakota.

...Great Basin...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely across much
of Nevada, far northwestern Arizona, and southwestern Utah today. As
the aforementioned enhanced mid-level flow impinges on the area
during the afternoon, a deep, well-mixed boundary layer will promote
sustained surface winds of 20-30 mph (with stronger gusts) amidst
critical minimum RH values (e.g., 15%) and increasingly dry fuels.
Of additional concern is the potential for lightning holdover fires
from isolated dry thunderstorms the past few days. Cloud-to-ground
lightning data suggest the greatest potential for holdover fires is
across central Nevada.

...Northern Plains...
Elevated meteorological fire weather conditions appear likely across
portions of northeastern Montana into western/central North Dakota
this afternoon with sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph and minimum
RH values near 20-25%. However, a large part of this area received
0.25 inches or more of rainfall within the last 12 hours and/or is
forecast to into tomorrow morning. Thus, the coverage of elevated
fire weather conditions remains somewhat uncertain and the Elevated
area may need to be adjusted (or even removed) in future outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EDT Sun Jun 06 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 09 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 13 2021

...Locally Heavy Rainfall from the Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to
the Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic...
...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S....

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered guidance of the 06
UTC GFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend
of Models Wednesday-Friday before moving to the compatible
GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means next weekend amid gradually
growing forecast spread. The pattern overall offers above normal
forecast predictability/continuity and remains consistent with 12
UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Much above normal to near record warmth will persist next week for
the northern Rockies/Plains and the Upper Midwest. Upper trough
ejection over the West Wed-Thu may then focus north-central U.S.
convection. Unsettled weather meanwhile with a slowly ejecting
upper level trough/low may spread locally heavy midweek TN and OH
River Valleys rainfall to the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic later week coincident with a settling of a
temperature moderating backdoor front. A storm system slowly
approaching the West Coast may bring precipitation and unsettled
weather to the Pacific Northwest by next weekend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EDT Sun Jun 06 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 09 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 13 2021

...Locally Heavy Rainfall from the Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to
the Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic...
...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S....

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered guidance of the 06
UTC GFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and the 13 UTC National Blend
of Models Wednesday-Friday before moving to the compatible
GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means next weekend amid gradually
growing forecast spread. The pattern overall offers above normal
forecast predictability/continuity and remains consistent with 12
UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Much above normal to near record warmth will persist next week for
the northern Rockies/Plains and the Upper Midwest. Upper trough
ejection over the West Wed-Thu may then focus north-central U.S.
convection. Unsettled weather meanwhile with a slowly ejecting
upper level trough/low may spread locally heavy midweek TN and OH
River Valleys rainfall to the central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic later week coincident with a settling of a
temperature moderating backdoor front. A storm system slowly
approaching the West Coast may bring precipitation and unsettled
weather to the Pacific Northwest by next weekend.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 PM CDT Sun Jun 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN NEVADA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL/SOUTHERN
NEVADA AND SOUTHWESTERN UTAH...

A small expansion of the elevated area was made into portions of
south-central Wyoming. The latest high-resolution guidance suggests
dry/breezy conditions will extend into this region where fuels are
at least marginally receptive. Otherwise, the balance of the
previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 06/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Sun Jun 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid/upper-level Pacific Northwest trough is forecast to
amplify offshore through Day 2/Monday, which will allow the area of
enhanced mid-level flow near its base to become increasingly
meridional. Meanwhile, a secondary upper-level trough is forecast to
shift onshore across portions of southern California and into the
four corners area through the day.

...Great Basin...
Two primary areas of critical fire weather conditions are expected
Day 2/Monday across the Great Basin.

1. Northwestern Nevada
Critical fire weather conditions are likely across portions of
northwestern Nevada during the afternoon/evening as the
aforementioned area of enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
broad Pacific Northwest trough remains over the area. Sustained
surface winds in excess of 20 mph are expected to overlap critical
minimum RH values (e.g., < 15%) and dry fuels.

2. Central/Southern Nevada and southwest Utah
Critical fire weather conditions are also likely across portions of
the southern Great Basin Day 2/Monday afternoon and evening as
enhanced mid-level flow from the aforementioned secondary
upper-level trough overspreads the area. Sustained surface winds of
20-30 mph and minimum RH values near 10-15% are expected amidst
increasingly dry fuels. Lightning holdover fires are also possible
from dry thunderstorms the past few days. Cloud-to-ground
lightning data suggest the greatest potential for holdover fires is
across central Nevada.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun June 06 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Valid 00Z Mon Jun 07 2021 - 00Z Wed Jun 09 2021

...Heatwave persists from the Upper Midwest to the East Coast...

...Additional heavy rain for portions of the Gulf Coast...

An early season heatwave across the northern tier of the country
will persist into the start of the week, with many locations
reaching upper 80s to upper 90s/low 100s from the High Plains to
the northern parts of the Ohio Valley. The Eastern Seaboard will
also start to get toasty and humid as the Bermuda High strengthens
offshore over the next few days. The Desert Southwest will be
stifling, with daily maximums averaging 100 to 110s at the lower
elevations.

Although the most of the Southern Plains and the Deep South will
not be as hot, thanks to extensive cloud cover, it will however
have multiple rounds of rain. Periods of moderate to heavy showers
across the central portions of the Gulf Coast and surrounding
areas will have an increased risk for scattered to widespread
flooding through at least Wednesday morning. Some locations may
receive upwards of 3 inches in addition to what has already fallen
this weekend. Heavy rain is also expected across the ArkLaTex
region in connection with the slow moving upper low, and for the
Cascades as a couple of Pacific disturbances pass through the
region. Additionally, the Storm Prediction Center has identified
most of the Dakotas and parts of western Minnesota has having a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for Monday as a defined
surface low and front intercepts a warm and unstable airmass
across this region. The severe weather threat is expected to
continue of the Dakotas into Tuesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
235 AM EDT Mon Jun 07 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Jun 10 2021 - 12Z Mon Jun 14 2021

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Thursday and Friday from the
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic...
...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S Late
This Week and Weekend....

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. This puts the primary storm
tracks from the northern Rockies into the northern Plains while
some waves of low pressure will work through portions of the
eastern U.S. before settling down closer to the Southeast by early
next week. The main model differences were noted across the West
with the progression of shortwave energy rounding the base of the
mean trough. Some of the typical biases were noted, with the GFS
on the faster side of the model spread. Across the East/Northeast,
some uncertainty on how a deepening low could force the wavy
stationary boundary in place further south this week and allow
sprawling high pressure to settle over the Great Lakes. The
consensus is for this front to push southward into the Southeast
before washing out/stalling. Overall, the medium range blend
consisted of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 18Z GFS for days 3-5
followed by mostly ECENS/GEFS means with some deterministic ECMWF
included for days 6-7. The pattern overall offers above normal
forecast predictability and continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Upper level ridging building through the central U.S. will favor
much above normal to possibly record warmth across the northern
Rockies and northern Plains Thursday and then again later in the
weekend to early next week (brief reprieve expected
Friday/Saturday). Departures above normal could reach 15F to 20F
with highs well into the 90s.

Locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash flooding will be
possible Thursday and Friday across portions of the Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic as moisture and lift associated with a weak upper
level feature traverses the region. Its eventual interaction with
a more substantial cold front dropping south will shunt the
moisture southward this weekend. For this upcoming weekend,
unsettled weather and higher precipitation chances will be
confined to the Southeast U.S. along the residual frontal boundary
as well as portions of the Pacific Northwest as a few waves of low
pressure move onshore.

...Locally Heavy Rainfall Thursday and Friday from the
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys to the Central Appalachians and
Mid-Atlantic...
...Much Above Normal Temperatures for the North-Central U.S Late
This Week and Weekend....

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday) and is driven by the amplified upper level
pattern featuring a western U.S. trough with ridging across the
southern to central U.S. and some troughing becoming established
over the Northeast this weekend. This puts the primary storm
tracks from the northern Rockies into the northern Plains while
some waves of low pressure will work through portions of the
eastern U.S. before settling down closer to the Southeast by early
next week. The main model differences were noted across the West
with the progression of shortwave energy rounding the base of the
mean trough. Some of the typical biases were noted, with the GFS
on the faster side of the model spread. Across the East/Northeast,
some uncertainty on how a deepening low could force the wavy
stationary boundary in place further south this week and allow
sprawling high pressure to settle over the Great Lakes. The
consensus is for this front to push southward into the Southeast
before washing out/stalling. Overall, the medium range blend
consisted of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 18Z GFS for days 3-5
followed by mostly ECENS/GEFS means with some deterministic ECMWF
included for days 6-7. The pattern overall offers above normal
forecast predictability and continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Upper level ridging building through the central U.S. will favor
much above normal to possibly record warmth across the northern
Rockies and northern Plains Thursday and then again later in the
weekend to early next week (brief reprieve expected
Friday/Saturday). Departures above normal could reach 15F to 20F
with highs well into the 90s.

Locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash flooding will be
possible Thursday and Friday across portions of the Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic as moisture and lift associated with a weak upper
level feature traverses the region. Its eventual interaction with
a more substantial cold front dropping south will shunt the
moisture southward this weekend. For this upcoming weekend,
unsettled weather and higher precipitation chances will be
confined to the Southeast U.S. along the residual frontal boundary
as well as portions of the Pacific Northwest as a few waves of low
pressure move onshore.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWESTERN NEVADA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN NEVADA
AND SOUTHWESTERN UTAH...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale mid/upper-level trough over the eastern Pacific Ocean
is forecast to amplify while remaining offshore through tonight.
Meanwhile, a secondary mid/upper-level low is forecast to weaken as
it moves onshore across southern California and toward the Four
Corners area.

...Great Basin...
Critical fire weather conditions are most likely today across:

1. Portions of northwestern Nevada
Enhanced mid-level flow along the eastern/southeastern periphery of
the aforementioned eastern Pacific Ocean trough is forecast to
persist (while also becoming more southerly) over portions of
northwestern Nevada through today. Critical fire weather conditions
are expected by afternoon, as sustained westerly winds near 20-30
mph (with greater gusts) overlap minimum RH values of 15% or less
and dry fuels. Fire weather conditions should abate overnight as
winds subside and RH values recover.

2. Portions of southeastern Nevada and southwestern Utah
Enhanced mid-level flow is forecast to accompany the aforementioned
secondary mid-level low as it shifts across the southwestern United
States. Critical fire weather conditions are expected by afternoon
as sustained southwesterly winds of 20-30 mph overlap Critical RH
values (e.g. < 15%) and increasingly receptive fuels. Of additional
concern is the threat for lightning holdovers from isolated dry
thunderstorms in recent days. Archived cloud-to-ground lightning and
AHPS accumulated precipitation data suggest the greatest threat for
lightning holdovers would exist over south-central Nevada. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may remain through the overnight
due to lingering breeziness and somewhat poor overnight RH
recoveries.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Mon Jun 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
A broad Pacific Northwest trough is forecast to continue amplifying
while remaining offshore across the eastern Pacific Ocean Day
2/Tuesday. As this occurs, a belt of enhanced mid-level flow is
forecast to strengthen over much of the western United States.

...Great Basin...
Critical fire weather conditions appear most likely Day 2/Tuesday
across portions of southeastern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and far
northwestern Arizona as the aforementioned belt of enhanced
mid-level flow impinges on the area. Critical fire weather
conditions are forecast to develop by midday as efficient deep-layer
mixing promotes sustained southerly/southwesterly surface winds in
excess of 20 mph amidst minimum RH values at or below 15%. While
critical fire weather conditions should subside by late evening,
lingering breeziness and relatively poor overnight RH recoveries may
allow for locally elevated fire weather conditions through the
overnight.

...South-central Wyoming...
Meteorological critical fire weather conditions are expected across
much of south-central Wyoming Day 2/Tuesday, as strong
southerly/southwesterly sustained surface winds (> 25 mph) overlap
critical RH values (< 15%). However, these conditions are currently
expected where fuel loads are extremely low, precluding the
introduction of a critical fire weather area.

...Remaining quite warm from the Upper Midwest to the East Coast...

...Heavy rain for portions of the south-central states...

High temperatures will continue to be more reminiscent of the
middle of summer instead of early June across much of the
north-central U.S. for the beginning of the week, and these
anomalies will also extend across the Northeast states.  The
greatest departures from normal will likely be across South
Dakota, where afternoon highs could reach 95-100 degrees.  Highs
in the 90s can also be expected along the Interstate 95 corridor
from the Nation's Capitol to the greater Boston metro area.  It
will also be quite hot across the Desert Southwest and western
Texas with some 100-105 degree readings expected.  Cooler
temperatures will prevail from the Central Plains to the Ohio
Valley owing to greater cloud cover and more coverage of showers
and storms.

Another thing making weather headlines through Tuesday night will
be additional heavy rainfall across the south-central U.S.,
particularly across Arkansas where several inches of rain is
likely and a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect for
central and southern portions of that state.  Moisture rich flow
from the Gulf of Mexico will feed into a weak upper low over this
region, and promote the development of numerous showers and storms
through early Tuesday.  In terms of severe weather potential, the
Storm Prediction Center has a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
for Monday and Tuesday across portions of the Northern Plains as a
well defined surface low and front intercepts a warm and unstable
airmass across this region.  A Marginal Risk of severe weather
will exist farther south near the dryline and extending eastward
towards the ArkLaTex region on Monday.

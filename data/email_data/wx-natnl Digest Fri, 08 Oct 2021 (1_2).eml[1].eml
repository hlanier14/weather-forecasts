NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CDT Thu Oct 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (shown below) remains on track, with no
changes or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 10/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Thu Oct 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cooler conditions will be present across much of the Western CONUS
today. The exception will be southern Arizona and most of New Mexico
where dry and warm conditions are expected with afternoon minimum
relative humidity in the teens. However, winds are forecast to
remain less than 10 to 12 mph and fuels are still quite moist in
this area, therefore, the fire weather threat should remain low.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
135 PM EDT Thu Oct 7 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 10 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 14 2021

***First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle next week***

***Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains on Sunday and also Tuesday into
Wednesday***


18Z Update:  The updated forecast remains on track with an
amplified upper level pattern featuring a ridge axis from the Gulf
of Mexico to the East Coast, and a building trough with developing
closed low over the Intermountain West that will sustain a
significant low pressure system across the Plains by the middle of
next week.  Forecast confidence is generally above average on the
synoptic scale through Wednesday and then near average by next
Thursday.  The 6Z and 12Z runs of the GFS become more progressive
with the ejecting low from the Rockies to the western High Plains,
compared to the slower non-NCEP solutions.  Recent ensemble trends
support the slower deterministic model solutions by the second
half of the forecast period, so the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS was the
preferred blend for Wednesday and Thursday, whereas a general
deterministic model blend sufficed as a starting point for Sunday
into Tuesday.  The previous forecast discussion follows below for

For a medium range forecast, with one main exception there's
actually really good agreement through the entire period on the
overall large scale setup which features a shortwave/closed low
lifting through the southern Plains early next week, while
troughing amplifies over the West and a well defined low pressure
system emerges into the Central Plains by the middle of next week.
There remains some relatively minor timing and detail differences,
but these kinds of uncertainties may take until the short range to
resolve. Overall, the WPC forecast suite was derived from a
composite blend of the deterministic models, ensembles and
National Blend of Models for days 3-7. This maintains good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast helping to increase
confidence some in the pattern and relevant weather hazards. The
one main exception is over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Sun/Mon
where the 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and to a lesser extent ECMWF
ensembles wrap much more QPF inland from a western Atlantic low
than the GFS/UKMET/GEFS. WPC continuity, latest NHC guidance, and
latest 00 UTC guidance trends do not favor the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian solution.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

A slow moving frontal boundary and area of low pressure off the
East Coast, with limited tropical development probabilities as per
NHC, offers potential for some heavy downpours into coastal areas
of the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast, especially Sun/Mon. The WPC
product suite minimizes heavier rainfall potential onshore
considering latest NHC system guidance and WPC continuity.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their extended outlook. The system should then begin lifting
and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with mainly
light to moderate precipitation.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 25-30 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies beginning on Sunday. A
low pressure system should eject out of the Rockies into the
Plains, with increasing confidence in potentially heavy snowfall
within an emerging deformation area on the back/west side of the
low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible around and to the north of the low, with some
mixing of snow not out of the question during the colder overnight
hours. Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and
northern Plains by Wednesday and Thursday of next week as the
surface low deepens through the central to northern U.S. and
further enhances precipitation. Across the central and southern
Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with
another threat for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as
highlighted in the latest SPC extended outlook.

***First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle next week***

***Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains on Sunday and also Tuesday into
Wednesday***


18Z Update:  The updated forecast remains on track with an
amplified upper level pattern featuring a ridge axis from the Gulf
of Mexico to the East Coast, and a building trough with developing
closed low over the Intermountain West that will sustain a
significant low pressure system across the Plains by the middle of
next week.  Forecast confidence is generally above average on the
synoptic scale through Wednesday and then near average by next
Thursday.  The 6Z and 12Z runs of the GFS become more progressive
with the ejecting low from the Rockies to the western High Plains,
compared to the slower non-NCEP solutions.  Recent ensemble trends
support the slower deterministic model solutions by the second
half of the forecast period, so the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS was the
preferred blend for Wednesday and Thursday, whereas a general
deterministic model blend sufficed as a starting point for Sunday
into Tuesday.  The previous forecast discussion follows below for
reference. /Hamrick

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure is forecast to retrograde from
the
West into the Pacific while the strong anomalous area of mid-level high
pressure extending from Hudson Bay into the eastern half of the CONUS flatt=

and expands southwestward. This evolution supports some concerns for much
below-normal temperatures across the interior West early in the period, and
growing heavy precipitation potential for the Northwest coast and around
northern California later in Week-2. A surface cyclone exiting the northern
Plains early could bring some lingering high wind potential from parts of t=

Dakotas southward into the central High Plains. . Mid-level low pressure
forecast over Alaska during Week-2 supports below-normal temperatures for m=

of the state and enhanced onshore flow into southeastern Alaska, although n=

associated hazards appear likely at present.

FOR FRIDAY OCTOBER 15 - THURSDAY OCTOBER 21: Model guidance continues to
portray some degree of anomalous mid-level troughing over the North Pacific
and
western CONUS at the outset of Week-2. Most models are in agreement today t=
hat
a single, quasi-phased area of negative anomalies will stretch from eastern
Siberia southeastward across Alaska and near or into the western CONUS. Thi=
s
keeps a slight chance for well-below-normal temperatures across the interio=
r
West during the first couple days of week-2 before conditions moderate. The=
re
is model diversity regarding how far south and east the anomalous mean
mid-level troughing extends. The Canadian ensemble keeps mean negative 500-=
hPa
anomalies out of the CONUS while the ECMWF ensemble mean, the GFS ensemble
mean, and the GFS SuperEnsemble depict negative height anomalies over the
western CONUS for the period as a whole, but even those models portray a tr=
end
toward rising 500-hPa heights as week-2 progresses, and a sharpening trough
evolving off the West Coast. This poses some risk for heavy precipitation
during the last half of the period in the Northwest, but amounts are not
expected to meet hazards thresholds. A heavy precipitation hazard around
northern California - where normal amounts are considerably lower than in t=
he
Pacific Northwest - was also considered. However, model inconsistencies in =
the
evolution of daily details across the West don=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt =
engender enough confidence
to
post a heavy precipitation hazard at this time, although the region will be
closely monitored.



While the trough evolves in western North America, the large anomalous ridg=
e
farther east - centered near Hudson Bay - is expected to decline in magnitu=
de
and expand southwestward into the Intermountain West, Four Corners States, =
and
southernmost California. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
initially highlighted over these areas for Oct 15-16, but temperatures are
forecast to quickly moderate thereafter. ending any chance for
well-below-normal temperatures over the West.



The axis of the western trough extends northward from the northeastern Paci=
fic
into Alaska, retrograding slightly and sharpening across central or western
Alaska as week-2 progresses. This will have two effects: Odds will continue=
 to
favor subnormal temperatures statewide through most or all of week-2, and
there
will be periods of heavy precipitation and gusty winds in the Alaskan
Panhandle. But as with other parts of the country, the expected anomalous
conditions are not anticipated to meet hazards thresholds.



Mean areas of high sea-level pressure are expected to be centered in the
Rockies, and over some part of the east-central or northeastern CONUS. This
will create a somewhat anomalous strong flow of moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico into the lower half of the Mississippi Valley, enhancing chances for
surplus precipitation centered around the ArkLaTex region for part of week-=
2,
but given the magnitude of the anomaly, heavy precipitation there is not
expected to meet hazards thresholds.



The 6Z operational GFS is markedly different from other models, bringing th=
e
western trough into the central Pacific and depicting a building ridge in t=
he
western CONUS with a moderate trough settling into the eastern North Americ=
a
near the current ridge axis. At this time, the 6Z operational GFS is an
extreme
outlier and is discounted.

Cool conditions are expected to remain across most of the Western

southeast Arizona into New Mexico. Increasing mid-level flow will
overspread the region during the day Friday. Deep mixing is forecast
across this region during the afternoon hours which should bring
some of this stronger flow to the surface with sustained winds
around 15 mph expected in a region with relative humidity around 15
percent. Despite the expectation for dry and breezy conditions,
fuels are moist across the region and therefore, no elevated fire

Southern Plains beginning on Friday...

...Unsettled weather found across the Intermountain West, Northern
Rockies, and Northern Plains...

A pesky upper-level low pressure system that has led to several
rounds of heavy rain across the southeastern U.S. is finally
lifting north and expected to reach the Upper Great Lakes by
Friday. However, the tropical airmass left behind will continue to
fuel showers and thunderstorms capable of producing intense
downpours between the Southern Appalachians and eastern Tennessee
Valley. A few isolated instances of heavy rain will also remain
possible across Georgia into early Friday. A Moderate Risk (level
3/4) of Excessive Rainfall remains in effect across western North
Carolina, Upstate South Carolina, and northeast Georgia through
tonight. Soils in these regions remain saturated after several
days of scattered thunderstorms, leaving areas extremely
susceptible to flash flooding when new rounds of thunderstorms
develop. The heavy rain threat is forecast to shift slightly north
and east on Friday, into the Central Appalachians and Carolinas,
but overall the flash flood risk should diminish significantly
compared to the last few days. Meanwhile, a developing coastal low
pressure system offshore the Southeast is expected to produce
lingering showers over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through the
beginning of the weekend.

For central and south-central sections of the Lower 48, the main
weather story will be associated with potential record-breaking
heat beginning on Friday. An upper-level ridge ahead of a deep
trough entering the western U.S. will allow for high temperatures
to soar into the 90s across the Central and Southern Plains. These
temperatures equate to around 10 to 20 degrees above average and
could threaten several daily high temperature records, with the
warmest day forecast to occur on Saturday.

Otherwise, a deep upper-level trough currently entering the West
Coast is expected to usher in below average temperatures and
chances for precipitation. Showers, thunderstorms, and high
elevation snow is likely to be found across parts of the
Intermountain West and Northern/Central Rockies over the next few
days. A few instances of flash flooding are possible between
northern Nevada and southeast Idaho. By Saturday, as a low
pressure system ejects into the Northern Plains, isolated severe
thunderstorms are not out of the question across eastern North
Dakota and northwest Minnesota.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 13 - 17 2021

Today's model solutions are in somewhat good agreement on the predicted 500=
-
hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough is forecast over Alaska, while an amplified ridge=
 is
predicted south of the Aleutians. There is good agreement on a strong ridge
over the eastern U.S. While yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models we=
re in good agreement on an
anomalous trough and mean cyclonic flow over the western half of the CONUS,
today, the 500-hPa pattern over the western CONUS is much less certain than
yesterday. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models predict a much weaker t=
rough than yesterday, with
only slightly negative height anomalies over most of the West (except for t=
he
Pacific Northwest where below normal heights are more likely). This is like=
ly
due to an initial trough moving across the region in the beginning of the 6=
-10
day period, then another trough approaches the West Coast, with more
uncertainty in the second half of the period. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs 6z GEFS forecasts
negative height anomalies to extend farther inland than the other models,
explaining why the GEFS has the clearest signal of mean troughing over the
West. The 0z Canadian and ECMWF ensembles favor keeping the negative height
anomalies farther offshore. Due to the increased uncertainty in the West,
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa forecast uses a fairly equ=
al blend of the latest
GEFS,
Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means. The blend features positive height
anomalies
over much of the Aleutians, and negative height anomalies over the remainin=
g
portions of the state, extending into the western half of the CONUS. Large
positive height anomalies are forecast over the eastern half of the U.S.


With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the central and eastern CONUS (especially for =
the
eastern Great Lakes Region where tools, forecasting large positive temperat=
ure
anomalies, are in the best agreement). Below normal temperatures are favore=
d
over the western CONUS underneath predicted mean troughing and below normal
500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.
Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of Alaska
underneath predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights increase th=
e
odds of above normal precipitation over much of the northwestern CONUS.
Conversely, below normal precipitation is favored for the Four Corners Regi=
on
and Great Basin. Near to below normal precipitation is likely for most of t=
he
eastern third of the CONUS, underneath forecast ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights. The predicted passage of a storm system early in the perio=
d
enhances the likelihood of above normal precipitation for much of the centr=
al
U.S. Troughing and associated surface low pressure increase the odds of nea=
r
to
above normal precipitation over southern Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Near average, 3 out of 5, due =
an
amplified forecast pattern and good tools agreement over some of the domain=
,
offset by model  and tool disagreement in the western U.S.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 15 - 21 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to remain fairly amplif=
ied
over the CONUS. A predicted relatively deep trough and below normal 500-hPa
heights are forecast near the West Coast of the CONUS, while ridging and ab=
ove
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the northeastern CONUS.  A predic=
ted
trough and below normal heights are more likely over most of Alaska.


The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar to the 6-=
10
day outlook period. With mean troughing expected near the West Coast, below
normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS. Above normal
temperatures are likely for most areas of the central and eastern CONUS,
underneath the forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Near to
below
normal temperatures are slightly favored for Alaska, associated with mean
troughing forecast over the state.


Predicted troughing and possible enhanced Pacific flow increase the odds of
near to above normal precipitation for the West Coast of the CONUS. Below
normal precipitation probabilities are elevated over parts of the west-cent=
ral
CONUS as well as the Florida Peninsula. Above normal precipitation is likel=
y
over parts of the south central U.S., supported by the consolidation foreca=
st
tool. Troughing and associated surface low pressure increase the odds of ne=
ar
to above normal precipitation over the Aleutians, parts of southwest Alaska
and
the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
relatively good model agreement and a fairly amplified pattern.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

Extended Forecast Discussion

513 PM EDT Thu Oct 07 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 10 2021 - 12Z Thu Oct 14 2021

***First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle next week***

***Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains on Sunday and also Tuesday into
Wednesday***


18Z Update:  The updated forecast remains on track with an
amplified upper level pattern featuring a ridge axis from the Gulf
of Mexico to the East Coast, and a building trough with developing
closed low over the Intermountain West that will sustain a
significant low pressure system across the Plains by the middle of
next week.  Forecast confidence is generally above average on the
synoptic scale through Wednesday and then near average by next
Thursday.  The 6Z and 12Z runs of the GFS become more progressive
with the ejecting low from the Rockies to the western High Plains,
compared to the slower non-NCEP solutions.  Recent ensemble trends
support the slower deterministic model solutions by the second
half of the forecast period, so the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS was the
preferred blend for Wednesday and Thursday, whereas a general
deterministic model blend sufficed as a starting point for Sunday
into Tuesday.  The previous forecast discussion follows below for
reference. /Hamrick


...Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

For a medium range forecast, with one main exception there's
actually really good agreement through the entire period on the
overall large scale setup which features a shortwave/closed low
lifting through the southern Plains early next week, while
troughing amplifies over the West and a well defined low pressure
system emerges into the Central Plains by the middle of next week.
There remains some relatively minor timing and detail differences,
but these kinds of uncertainties may take until the short range to
resolve. Overall, the WPC forecast suite was derived from a
composite blend of the deterministic models, ensembles and
National Blend of Models for days 3-7. This maintains good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast helping to increase
confidence some in the pattern and relevant weather hazards. The
one main exception is over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Sun/Mon
where the 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and to a lesser extent ECMWF
ensembles wrap much more QPF inland from a western Atlantic low
than the GFS/UKMET/GEFS. WPC continuity, latest NHC guidance, and
latest 00 UTC guidance trends do not favor the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian solution.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

A slow moving frontal boundary and area of low pressure off the
East Coast, with limited tropical development probabilities as per
NHC, offers potential for some heavy downpours into coastal areas
of the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast, especially Sun/Mon. The WPC
product suite minimizes heavier rainfall potential onshore
considering latest NHC system guidance and WPC continuity.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their extended outlook. The system should then begin lifting
and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with mainly
light to moderate precipitation.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 25-30 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies beginning on Sunday. A
low pressure system should eject out of the Rockies into the
Plains, with increasing confidence in potentially heavy snowfall
within an emerging deformation area on the back/west side of the
low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible around and to the north of the low, with some
mixing of snow not out of the question during the colder overnight
hours. Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and
northern Plains by Wednesday and Thursday of next week as the
surface low deepens through the central to northern U.S. and
further enhances precipitation. Across the central and southern
Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with
another threat for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as
highlighted in the latest SPC extended outlook.

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 10/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CDT Sat Oct 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low will propagate through the Southern Plains
and merge with a mid-level trough positioned over the north-central
CONUS. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will take hold across the
West, with a zone of enhanced mid-level flow entering the northern
periphery of the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, localized
elevated fire-weather conditions may develop across portions of
north-central Montana and across western areas of the Dakotas, where
surface winds approaching 15 mph should develop by mid afternoon
amid RH values approaching the low 20s and perhaps upper teens in a
few locations. Otherwise, dry conditions and light surface winds
should prevail across much of the West, resulting in minimal
fire-weather concerns.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain Threat
mid to late next week...


...Overview...

The upper level flow during the medium range period should become
more amplified and blocky as an upper low closes off over the
east-central U.S. and an upper ridge/high builds over the northern
tier states and southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed
upper trough/low support will spread rainfall of varying intensity
and duration across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an
eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become
more elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. A lead upper low initially offshore of
southern California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper
trough and may produce some areas of rainfall over the
Southwest/Four Corners region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest suite of guidance generally agrees on the overall
pattern amplification, but continues to show variability with the
smaller scale, hard to resolve at these time scales, features.
There continues to be some uncertainty in terms of placement for
the upper low as it drops into the Southeast/Tennessee Valley on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and eventually lifts back north into the
Ohio Valley later in the week. The GFS has consistently been
displaced south of the rest of the guidance, so WPC favors a
non-GFS consensus blend for this feature. The amplifying eastern
Pacific upper trough off the West Coast shows reasonable larger
scale continuity, but with some continued spread with both timing
and how the energy will be distributed, especially next Friday
into Saturday.

This cycle of the WPC medium range suite was derived from a blend
of the deterministic models (less weighting of the GFS because of
Southeast closed low issues) for days 3-5, and then a general
blend of the ECMWF/GFS and ensemble means by the second half of
the period to help mitigate some of the late period detail
uncertainties. This also resulted in a forecast consistent with
the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a wavy frontal
system that slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic next week,
with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the region.
This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East through
much of next week, with an uncertain but gradual focus from the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal
that some locations could see some significant local totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or a multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement will be a factor.

A lead upper low ejecting northeastward into the Southwest is
expected to generate a period of rainfall over parts of the
Southwest, Four Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around
Tuesday-Wednesday. A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly
but robustly into the West will spread areas of rain gradually
southeastward with time into mid-later next week. Most activity
should be in the light-moderate range, but a few pockets of
heavier rain could be possible along with snow in the higher
elevations. The West Coast states should trend cooler with time as
the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes its way
through the region. Daytime highs by later next week could be 5-15
degrees below normal for some locations. Downstream upper ridging
traversing the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but
also maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies
for morning lows.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain Threat
mid to late next week...


...Overview...

The upper level flow during the medium range period should become
more amplified and blocky as an upper low closes off over the
east-central U.S. and an upper ridge/high builds over the northern
tier states and southern Canada. A leading wavy front and closed
upper trough/low support will spread rainfall of varying intensity
and duration across the eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an
eastern Pacific upper trough should steadily amplify and become
more elongated through the period, pushing a cold front into the
Northwest and California. A lead upper low initially offshore of
southern California will eject northeastward ahead of the upper
trough and may produce some areas of rainfall over the
Southwest/Four Corners region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest suite of guidance generally agrees on the overall
pattern amplification, but continues to show variability with the
smaller scale, hard to resolve at these time scales, features.
There continues to be some uncertainty in terms of placement for
the upper low as it drops into the Southeast/Tennessee Valley on
Tuesday and Wednesday, and eventually lifts back north into the
Ohio Valley later in the week. The GFS has consistently been
displaced south of the rest of the guidance, so WPC favors a
non-GFS consensus blend for this feature. The amplifying eastern
Pacific upper trough off the West Coast shows reasonable larger
scale continuity, but with some continued spread with both timing
and how the energy will be distributed, especially next Friday
into Saturday.

This cycle of the WPC medium range suite was derived from a blend
of the deterministic models (less weighting of the GFS because of
Southeast closed low issues) for days 3-5, and then a general
blend of the ECMWF/GFS and ensemble means by the second half of
the period to help mitigate some of the late period detail
uncertainties. This also resulted in a forecast consistent with
the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a wavy frontal
system that slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic next week,
with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the region.
This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East through
much of next week, with an uncertain but gradual focus from the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal
that some locations could see some significant local totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or a multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement will be a factor.

A lead upper low ejecting northeastward into the Southwest is
expected to generate a period of rainfall over parts of the
Southwest, Four Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around
Tuesday-Wednesday. A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly
but robustly into the West will spread areas of rain gradually
southeastward with time into mid-later next week. Most activity
should be in the light-moderate range, but a few pockets of
heavier rain could be possible along with snow in the higher
elevations. The West Coast states should trend cooler with time as
the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes its way
through the region. Daytime highs by later next week could be 5-15
degrees below normal for some locations. Downstream upper ridging
traversing the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but
also maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies
for morning lows.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

In addition to portions of the northern Rockies/northern High
Plains, locally Elevated conditions may also be observed by
afternoon peak heating across the Great Divide Basin towards the lee
of the Laramie Mountains in southern Wyoming. However, the brief and
localized nature of the dry and breezy conditions across the
central/northern Rockies into the northern Plains precludes Elevated
highlights this outlook.

..Squitieri.. 10/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CDT Sat Oct 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge positioned over the West is forecast to become
more amplified throughout the forecast period. This should result in
a predominately light/variable flow regime aloft, with any
appreciable mid-level flow being confined to the far northern areas
of the Pacific Northwest and into parts of southern Canada.
Consequently, dry conditions and light surface winds are expected at
the surface in most areas, with perhaps localized elevated
fire-weather conditions once again possible across portions of
north-central Montana during the afternoon as winds approach 15 mph
amid RH values falling into the low 20s.

...Scattered thunderstorms ahead of a cold front are expected to
bring brief periods of heavy rain across parts of the
mid-Mississippi into tonight...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through Monday...

A stationary front extending through the Plains and into the upper
Midwest is forecast to move gradually eastward during the next
couple of days.  Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected
to affect much of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys as well as the
Great Lakes through the rest of the weekend.  A weak low pressure
wave riding along the front will help bring a slight risk of
excessive rainfall through tonight over the mid-Mississippi Valley
where brief periods of heavy downpours are forecast to accompany
some of the stronger thunderstorms.  The threat of excessive
rainfall should lessen to marginal on Sunday into Monday morning
as over parts of the Tennessee Valley as the scattered storms
spread into the Deep South and the Tennessee Valley.  More
scattered thunderstorms are also expected to slowly spread into
the Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes closer to the center of a low
pressure system forecast to slowly track east-southeast across the
Great Lakes

Meanwhile, a steady rain is forecast to develop in the central and
southern New England later on Sunday following the passage of a
back door cold front.  The low pressure system over the Great
Lakes will slowly approach New England on Monday, bringing
moderate rainfall as well as the chance of thunderstorms into the
northeastern U.S. on Monday.  The nice stretch of fine autumn
weather along the East Coast should extend one more day on Sunday
before the scattered thunderstorms slowly make their way into the
Appalachians Sunday night and into the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.
Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms moving across the Deep South
should reach the interior Southeast later on Monday.

In the western U.S., poor air quality is expected to linger across
the San Joaquin Valley of California where Air Quality Alerts are
in effect through Monday.  Temperature-wise, much of the country,
except the Southwest and along the West Coast, will see above
normal temperatures.  Much above normal temperatures are forecast
to reach the northern High Plains on Monday where high
temperatures well into the 80s are expected ahead of the next
upper trough.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 AM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge positioned over the West will amplify
throughout the day. Enhanced mid-level flow will remain largely
confined to portions of southern Canada, with far northern portions
of the northern tier of states residing on the southern periphery of
these winds. Consequently, fire-weather concerns remain low for most
areas today. Perhaps localized elevated fire-weather conditions are
possible across portions of north-central Montana, as well as
portions of south-central Wyoming, where westerly surface winds near
15 mph and RH values into the low 20s should reside amid dry and
receptive fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CDT Sun Oct 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest, and
a closed upper-level low is forecast to enter portions of Southern
California. These features will setup broad troughing across the
West and northern Rockies, with a highly amplifying/elongating ridge
overspreading much of the central/northern Plains. In addition, a
mid-level short-wave trough should propagate through portions of the
northern Rockies amid modestly enhanced flow.

...Eastern Montana and Northeast Wyoming...
Light southerly return flow should develop at the surface across
eastern Montana, northeast Wyoming, and vicinity, where sustained
winds should approach 15 mph during the afternoon. Meanwhile, strong
insolation/surface heating should lead to large dew point
depressions and RH values falling into the teens (with isolated
single digits). Given these conditions, a small area delineating
potential for elevated fire-weather conditions has been introduced
for the region, confined to the most likely overlap of conducive
winds/RH/fuels.

...Northern Great Basin...
Localized elevated fire-weather conditions are possible across
portions of southern Idaho, northern Nevada, and southeast Oregon.
Surface winds may approach 15 mph during the afternoon amid warm/dry
conditions (RH values into the teens) and fuels that appear at least
marginally receptive to large-fire spread.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain
Threat...


...Overview...

The flow pattern amplifies for the coming week as an upper low
closes off over the east-central U.S. and an upper ridge/high
builds over the northern tier states and southern Canada. A
leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low support will spread
an enhanced rainfall threat across the eastern third of the
country. Meanwhile, an eastern Pacific upper trough should
steadily amplify and become more elongated/split through this
period, pushing a wavy cold front into the West and north-central
U.S. along with increasing chances for moderate precipitation. A
lead upper low initially offshore of southern California will also
eject northeastward ahead of the main upper trough and produce
some midweek precipitation over the central Great Basin/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of best clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and
the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models for days 3/4 (Wed/Thu). Weighted the
GFS/ECMWF heavily during this period. Despite continued variance
with embedded weather features through the period, the overall
pattern evolution still seems to offer decent predictability into
days 5-7 (Fri/next weekend). In the blend, weighted the compatible
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means heavily during this period consistent
with growing forecast spread. This maintains reasonable WPC
product continuity overall, but did reasonably trend slightly
slower with heavier rainfall lifting over the East into a
Northeast high given the closed/blocky nature of the larger scale
flow. Guidance is slowly improving variances and a composite of
later 00 UTC guidance remains generally in line.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a wavy
frontal system that slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week, with enhanced focus as a closed upper low rotates over the
region. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
through much of the week, with an uncertain but gradual focus from
the Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. Guidance continues to signal
that some locations could see some significant local totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or a multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor for a threat of
runoff issues will be the Southern Appalachians where terrain
enhancement will also be a factor.

Northeastward ejection of a lead upper trough is expected to
generate modest precipitation into midweek for the central Great
Basin/Rockies. A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly but
robustly into the West will spread areas of rain gradually
southeastward mid-later week and into the weekend, eventually
working into the north-central states. Most activity should be in
the light-moderate range, along with some snow at higher
elevations. The West Coast states should trend cooler with time as
the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes its way
through the region. Daytime highs by later next week could be 5-15
degrees below normal for some locations. Downstream upper ridging
traversing the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but
also maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies
for morning lows.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys into parts of the Great Lakes through
Monday morning...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through Monday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern High Plains...

A quasi-stationary front extending from the Northeast to the Great
Lakes then southwestward to the Southern Plains will remain
primarily stationary through Tuesday.  Moisture from the Western
Gulf of Mexico will stream northward over the Central Gulf Coast,
Ohio Valley, and the Great Lakes.  Showers and thunderstorms will
develop along and near the boundary, with some storms producing
heavy rain from the Central Gulf Coast to the Great Lakes.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys into parts of
the Great Lakes through Monday morning.  The associated heavy rain
will create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas
that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.   The threat of
excessive rainfall will move to parts of the Central Gulf Coast,
Southeast, and Southern Appalachians as well as parts of the
Northeast on Monday into Tuesday morning. Rain will continue over
the Northeast through Tuesday. The showers and thunderstorms will
slowly expand into parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast overnight
Sunday into Monday.

Meanwhile, on late Monday morning, moisture will start to stream
into Southern California and the Southwest as upper-level energy
begins to move over Southern California.  The moisture and energy
will produce showers and thunderstorms over parts of Southern
California and the Southwest overnight Monday into Tuesday.

Furthermore, the smoke from wildfires will lead to poor air
quality over the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Air
Quality Alerts are in effect through Monday.  Additionally, an
upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the Rockies as
temperatures will become 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern High Plains.

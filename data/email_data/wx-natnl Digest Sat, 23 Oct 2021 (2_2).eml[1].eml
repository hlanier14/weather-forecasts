Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 23 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 25 2021

...Series of low pressure systems to produce heavy rainfall and
mountain snow to northern California...

...Potent system to produce heavy rain and thunderstorms across
Mississippi Valley and Midwest...

...Warm pattern continues for the South while East Coast warms up
and West cools...

...Elevated fire weather risk issued for portions of the Southern
Plains...

Much needed precipitation is on its way to northern California as
a series of low pressure systems bring an influx of Pacific
moisture to the region over the next few days. Heavy rain is
likely across the lower elevations of northern California, while
many of the western mountain ranges will receive heavy snowfall
through Monday. This atmospheric river event will generate
multiple inches of rainfall for the aforementioned lowlands and
several inches of snow for the Northern Rockies, Sierra and
Cascades. The Sierra could see snowfall totals in excess of 2 feet
at its highest peaks. Flooding and secondary hazards associated
with flooding are a concern over parts of Northern California for
the next few days as precipitation ramps up. Moderate Risks of
Excessive Rainfall leading to flash flooding are in effect for
these areas as a result. This AR event should last until Tuesday
when this potent Pacific system will have moved into the Great
Plains.

A quasi-stationary boundary draped across the Plains and Midwest
will be the focus for heavy precipitation heading into the work
week. An area of low pressure will develop along this boundary
tomorrow as an upper-trough interacts with the front. Heavy rain
and thunderstorms will then spread across the Midwest and into the
Northeast. Thunderstorm activity will also kick off out ahead of
this system's cold front over the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.
Some thunderstorms may be severe as indicated by the Storm
Prediction Center's Slight Risk areas for the Midwest and
Mississippi Valley over the next few days.

The Deep South will continue to experience above average warm high
temperatures over the next few days as troughing in the West
continues to pull warm air into the southern states. Temperatures
will fall precipitously across the West Coast on the backside of
the powerful Pacific system. Warm air will eventually creep up the
East Coast by Monday due to the approaching low pressure system
and its ascendant warm front. The Rocky foothills will also
experience a warm up on Monday thanks to the approaching Pacific
system. Elevated fire weather risks continue across portions of
the Southern Plains over the next couple of days due to warm and
dry conditions.

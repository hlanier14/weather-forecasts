Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1051 AM CST Tue Dec 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

Today's fire weather forecast remains on track, with no changes
needed. Locally elevated fire weather conditions may also occur
through mid/late afternoon across portions of northwestern Kansas
and far northeast Colorado, where sustained surface wind speeds near
20 mph (stronger gusts) overlap minimum RH values near 20-25% and
fuels that remain critically receptive. However, afternoon high
temperatures in the 30s (F) across this area should limit a more
robust fire weather threat.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CST Tue Dec 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions remain likely today across parts of
the southern High Plains. Early-morning water-vapor imagery reveals
an upper-level shortwave over the Four Corners approaching the
southern Rockies. Ahead of this wave, a lee cyclone over northeast
CO has begun to shift to the southeast amid strong low-level warm
advection and broad-scale ascent associated with the upper
disturbance. Several West Texas Mesonet stations have recently
reported warming temperatures and strengthening west/southwest winds
(up to 30 mph in some locations), likely in response to the
tightening regional pressure gradient and strengthening zonal
mid-level flow. Precipitation noted over west TX in early-morning
radar mosaics is likely falling as virga given 20+ F dewpoint
depressions at the surface, a substantial dry layer in the 00 UTC
AMA sounding, and few reports of rainfall under the radar echoes.
This has resulted in some boundary-layer moistening (indicated by
dewpoint rises over the past few hours), and casts uncertainty into
the RH forecast for this afternoon. However, this activity is not
expected to appreciably moisten fuels to mitigate the fire weather
concern.

These observations align with recent model trends that continue to
suggest an early passage of the synoptic wave and associated wind
maxima. Surface winds will likely be maximized between 12-18 UTC
this morning across west TX into western OK before gradually
diminishing during the afternoon/evening hours. This temporal
displacement of strongest winds with peak diurnal heating will limit
the potential for sustained and widespread critical conditions.
However, areas of elevated conditions remain likely as 15-25 mph
winds (gusting up to 30-40 mph at times) coincide with RH reductions
into the low 20s. Localized/transient critical conditions remain
possible, especially under any lingering axes of stronger mid-level
flow. Latest ensemble guidance continues to highlight along/north of
the I-20 corridor in west TX as well as the TX Panhandle into
western OK as preferential zones of drier/windier conditions. To the
north, the fire weather threat across KS may be limited by the
passage of a cold front during the early afternoon, but current
indications are that a few hours of elevated conditions remain
likely prior to the frontal passage.

FOR WEDNESDAY JANUARY 05 - TUESDAY JANUARY 11: By the beginning of week-2,
troughing is forecast over the western CONUS with anomalous ridging persist=
ing
over the Southeast. The ECMWF is more progressive with the troughing compar=
ed
to the GEFS, favoring the colder air making its way further south and east
into
parts of the Central Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio Valley=
.
The GEFS depicts a slightly stronger southeast ridge and confines the most
anomalous cold to the Northern Plains. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
indicate at least a 60% chance that minimum temperatures fall below the 15t=
h
climatological percentile across parts of the Northern Plains and uncalibra=
ted
guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict minimum temperatures
dropping
below -20 deg F over parts of the region, supporting a high risk for much
below
normal temperatures for Jan 5 to 7. The moderate risk for much below normal
temperatures is posted through Jan 8, and includes much of the Northern
Plains,
Upper Mississippi Valley, and western Great Lakes, where both reforecast to=
ols
indicate at least a 40% chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th
climatological percentile and 0 deg F. The slight risk is valid for all of
week-2 and covers a broader area of the western and central CONUS given the
aforementioned uncertainty in the model guidance.



The troughing across the West supports above-normal precipitation over the
western third of the CONUS throughout week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles
continue to favor surface low formation in the northeastern Pacific resulti=
ng
in enhanced and possibly heavy precipitation along the West Coast. The GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitatio=
n
amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches across parts of the Paci=
fic
Northwest and California, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitation f=
or
the region from Jan 5 to 9. With anomalously cold air favored to be in plac=
e,
the predicted increase in moisture also supports a slight risk of heavy sno=
w
over the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, Great Basin, and Northern and Central
Rockies from Jan 5 to 9. Additionally, periods of strong surface pressure
gradients are indicated by both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles during the ear=
ly
and middle portion of week-2, and reforecast tools depict a broad region wi=
th
at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25-m=
ph
across the western and north-central CONUS supporting a slight risk of high
winds from Jan 5 to 9 over these areas. By the end of week-2, the GEFS and
ECMWF ensembles indicate weak ridging beginning to develop near the West Co=
ast
of the CONUS, which would result in decreasing precipitation chances, allow=
ing
all of the related hazards to be discontinued after Jan 9.



The evolving mid-level pattern with troughing shifting further east and
relatively colder air arriving across the north-central CONUS favors increa=
sed
baroclinicity developing across the east-central CONUS. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF,
and
Canadian ensembles all depict surface low pressure near the Great Lakes aro=
und
the day 8-9 (Jan 5-6) timeframe. This potential system, along with its
trailing
cold front would lead to increased precipitation chances for a large portio=
n
of
the eastern CONUS, with wintry precipitation favored across northern areas =
and
heavier rainfall across the southern states. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools depict at least a 20% chance 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85=
th
climatological percentile across much of the eastern CONUS, and 1 inch acro=
ss
the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys during the early part of the
period. Although the liquid equivalent totals are forecast to be lower fart=
her
north, the increased potential for wintry precipitation supports having a
broad
slight risk of heavy precipitation posted from Jan 5 to 7.



Across Alaska, northerly mid-level flow on the backside of the trough axis
forecast over western North America favors below normal temperatures over m=
uch
of Alaska at the onset of week-2. Building mid-level heights over the Berin=
g
Sea and western Mainland Alaska favors a moderation in temperatures,
especially
in the GEFS, with the most anomalous cold being favored over the southeaste=
rn
Mainland and the Panhandle, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indic=
ate
elevated probabilities for record low temperatures and negative anomalies
potentially exceeding -25 deg F. A high risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
is posted for the Alaska Panhandle from Jan 5 to 7 where the reforecast too=
ls
depict at least a 60% chance minimum temperatures drop below the lowest 10t=
h
climatological percentile. A moderate risk of much below normal temperature=
s
continues through Jan 8, and a broader slight risk remains designated from =
the
Kenai Peninsula through the Alaska Panhandle for all of week-2.

...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the 06 UTC GEFS ensemble mean and 00 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble mean that offer a similar synoptic
pattern evolution days 3-7 in a pattern with better than normal
forecast spread and predictability. The composite blend tends to
mitigate small-moderate scales timing and phasing differences with
embedded systems that remains an issue that increases local focus
uncertainty. The latest few runs of the GFS have shown less
stellar run to run continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified ridge built over the east-central Pacific will allow
the digging of a series of potent shortwave troughs and frontal
systems into the West Friday into Saturday along with cold
temperatures and unsettled weather conditions highlighted by
south-central Great Basin/Rockies heavy snows as locally enhanced
by favored terrain. Ejecting upper trough energies in two streams
out from the West will generate systems and enhance an emerging
east-central U.S. precipitation focus with progression out across
the central and eastern U.S. as an upper ridge erodes over the
Southeast. Heavy rains and some local runoff issues may develop
and spread northeastward across the Mid-South and OH
Valley/Northeast to ring in the new year. SPC also offers some
risk of severe weather over the South Friday into Saturday. Arctic
air on the backside will meanwhile spill through the n-central
U.S. to also spread a risk of heavy snow from the central Plains
to the Midwest/Great Lakes. Wavy frontal progression should shift
organized rains more into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast into Sunday
before working offshore. Post-frontal cold air intrusion may then
favor lingering Sunday snow/ice chances from the southern
Appalachians and vicinity up through the Northeast.

Sunday-Tuesday of next week then looks quite active for the
Northwest and north-central California as part of a developing
Omega block over the Northeast Pacific in the form of a deeply
amplified closed upper low/trough digs slowly southward from the
Gulf of Alaska to offshore the Northwest. Expect an increasingly
windy multi-day heavy precipitation episode with moderate to heavy
coastal rains and heavy mountain snows inland from the Cascades to
the Sierra.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 PM CST Tue Dec 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

The forecast of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
across a broad area of the southern Plains for tomorrow remains on
track. Though, relatively poor confidence regarding the eastward
extent of the fire weather potential and the magnitude of the
overall threat persists, as guidance continues to exhibit large
spread with key features (e.g., the timing, location, and magnitude
of mid-level shortwave trough and attendant surface cyclone).

Primary adjustment with this forecast was to expand the elevated
area a bit farther eastward to along/west of the I-35 corridor in
central/southern Oklahoma and north-central Texas based on some of
the more aggressive model guidance (e.g., GFS, HRRR). This area is
also along the receptive fuel gradient (per WFAS ERC percentiles),
with fuels becoming significantly less receptive to the east.

A couple of hours of locally critical conditions are most likely
along and near the I-20 corridor from the Rolling Plains into
North-Central Texas (where poor RH recoveries are anticipated
tonight into tomorrow morning). However, the uncertainty regarding
the duration and coverage of Critical conditions remains too large
to upgrade at this time.

..Elliott.. 12/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Tue Dec 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist into Wednesday for parts of the
southern Plains as a second upper-level disturbance transverses the
region. A shortwave trough, currently noted in water-vapor imagery
off the OR coast, is forecast to propagate across the southern
Rockies and into the south-central Plains early Wednesday. Current
indications suggest a similar synoptic evolution to Tuesday may
occur in which 20+ mph sustained winds exit the region prior to peak
diurnal heating. Nonetheless, the regional pressure gradient will
maintain 15-20 mph winds across the broader region throughout the
day.

Across the Southwest, dewpoint temperatures are generally within the
50-75th percentiles compared to climatology for late December. While
this moisture is not anomalously high, it will gradually filter into
the southern High Plains/southern Plains over the next 48 hours and
may limit the potential for sub-20% RH. An additional mitigating
factor is a gradual cooling trend that is depicted in most ensemble
members. However, mostly clear skies may support sufficient
boundary-layer warming/mixing to yield areas of RH values in the
15-20% range (as suggested by a few drier solutions). Additionally,
some uncertainty exists regarding the northeastern extent of the
fire weather concern as a stalled cold front across KS begins to
shift south through the day. Overall, these trends in observations
and guidance point towards reasonably high potential for elevated
fire weather conditions with the possibility of localized/transient
critical conditions.

300 PM EST Tue December 28 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 03 - 07 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the Bering Sea is forecast, leading to troughing
downstream
across the Gulf of Alaska to the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights extending northeastward to the Northern Plains. Anomalous ridging i=
s
likely farther to the southeast across the Southern Plains and the eastern
CONUS associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Below normal temperatures are favored over Alaska due to the influence of
surface high pressure over the state and parts of western Canada. Troughing
over the western and north-central CONUS favors elevated probabilities for
below-normal temperatures over the western CONUS, north-central CONUS, and
western Great Lakes. Conversely, ridging over the south-central and eastern
CONUS leads to increased chances of near to above-normal temperatures from =
the
Southern Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.

Mean offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to below-normal
precipitation across the state of Alaska associated with above-normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of
above-normal precipitation for the western CONUS extending to the northern
Great Plains and Great Lakes. Above-normal precipitation is also favored ov=
er
much of the northeastern CONUS, the Tennessee Valley, and the eastern Middl=
e
Mississippi Valley ahead of the forecast troughing with potential storm
systems
developing. Near to below-normal precipitation is favored for the Southern
Plains consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement on most features, though there is uncertainty in =
how
surface features in the northeastern CONUS will evolve.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 05 - 11 2022

The Week-2 forecasts are very similar to the 6-10 day period. There is good
model agreement on most features, which are expected to remain in place but
may
deamplify a bit toward the end of the period. Meanwhile, the ridge in the
Bering Sea and the trough over the western CONUS are expected to shift
slightly
eastward, increasing the probability of below-normal temperatures over the
Middle Mississippi Valley and near to above-normal precipitation for the
eastern CONUS due to the storm systems passing through.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Spring like temperatures persist in the South and East;
elevated fire weather risk for parts of the Southern Plains;
bitterly cold wind chills in the northern Rockies and High Plains
today...

...Wintry weather to cause treacherous travel conditions from the
Midwest to the interior Northeast today; Slight Risks for severe
storms and Excessive Rainfall posted in parts of the Deep South
Wednesday...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Sierra Nevada and Central/Southern
Rockies...

The jet stream pattern heading into the middle of the week
indicates persistent troughing over the western U.S., with a ridge
established over the Southeast. The result is a distinct
separation of air-masses; winter is in full control in the North
and West while record-breaking spring-like temperatures are firmly
entrenched in the South and East-Central U.S. South of the polar
front, numerous daily record highs and warm lows are expected
throughout much of the South with daily temperature departures
ranging between 25 to 35 degrees above normal. The mixture of
anomalous heat, very dry conditions, and gusty winds keeps an
Elevated Risk area for fire weather conditions in place atop the
southern High Plains through Wednesday. The anomalous warmth is
expected to linger over the South and Mid-Atlantic through the new
year, where additional daily high and warm low records will be
threatened through Saturday. To put the warmth in perspective,
lows that are warmer than the normal highs for late December will
be common from the Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf States through at
least Saturday. In the West, much colder temperatures are expected
with the coldest temperatures in the Northwest, northern Rockies,
and northern High Plains. Daily low temperatures will fall below
-25 degrees in northern parts of Montana and North Dakota, which
combined with gusty winds cause brutally cold wind chills through
the end of the work week. Even daytime highs will struggle to get
above zero in these regions. Accordingly, a Wind Chill Warning
remains in effect along the northern Montana and North Dakota
border through Wednesday. The West Coast has the best chance to
witness record cold max temperatures through Wednesday, although
widespread record breaking cold is not anticipated.

As upper level disturbances track through the Intermountain West
and head east into the Plains, unsettled weather will become
increasingly focused in parts of the South and East. Light but
still potentially hazardous wintry weather is on tap from the
Midwest and Great Lakes to the northern Mid-Atlantic. Winter
Weather Advisories have been posted not just for up to a few
inches of snow, but also an icy wintry mix of snow, sleet, and
freezing rain that could result in minor to locally moderate
potential winter storm impacts, per the WPC Winter Storm Severity
Index (WSSI). Within the storm's warm sector, periods of rain are
expected from the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Ohio Valley.
Rain may fall heavily at times and could lead to localized flash
flooding, thus prompting the issuance of a Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall. Farther south, thunderstorms are in the
forecast for the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys with a
Marginal Risk for severe storms in Southeast Louisiana and
Southwest Mississippi. As a new upper level disturbance ejects out
of New Mexico on Wednesday morning, it will support and even more
favorable environment for organized severe weather and excessive
rainfall later in the day on Wednesday. This has prompted the
issuance of Slight Risks for both severe weather and excessive
rainfall tomorrow in the Tennessee Valley and Deep South.
Meanwhile, a lingering frontal system off the Southern California
Coast supports a threat of heavy rain through tomorrow, where a
Slight Risk was also raised for Wednesday. A Flood Watch also
remains over Southern California from Wednesday morning through
Thursday afternoon.

The ongoing troughing pattern out West will keep generating wintry
weather from the Sierra Nevada to the southern and central
Rockies. The heaviest snowfall accumulations will be confined to
the Mogollon Rim of Arizona, the Rockies of Colorado, and northern
New Mexico. Snowfall totals in the highest peaks will generally
average 1 to 2 feet today with locally higher amounts possible.
Lighter accumulations compared to recent days are anticipated
today along the West Coast, but the next upper level feature
diving through the West Coast will usher in yet another round of
heavy snow to the Sierra Nevada late tonight into Wednesday. By
early Thursday morning, another 1 to 2 feet of snow will have
fallen in throughout much of the Sierra Nevada with locally higher
totals in the tallest peaks. Moreover, expect heavy snowfall
chances to increase over the Cascades toward Thursday, with
moderate potential winter storm impacts highlighted by the WPC
WSSI. Expect more hazards travel conditions in these mountain
ranges through the middle of the week.

...Isolated chances for flash flooding found across parts of the
Southwest and Four Corners region through Wednesday morning...

...Cold front to bring unsettled weather and cooler temperatures
for the Northwest today and Northern Rockies by Tuesday...

...Well above average and potentially record-breaking warmth found
throughout the central/northern Plains and Midwest...

An upper-level low pressure system advancing across the Southwest
will help produce a few more rounds of scattered showers and
thunderstorms as the monsoon season draws to a close. Given the
sufficient moisture in place, intense rainfall rates will be
possible and could create isolated instances of flash flooding. A
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued
for parts of central Arizona and western New Mexico, as well as
the Four Corners region through Wednesday morning. Farther north,
a potent cold front in tandem with a deep upper-level trough is
currently approaching the Pacific Northwest and is expected to
swing into the northern Great Basin by this evening. Widespread
showers and much cooler temperatures will be found behind the cold
front. In fact, high elevation snow will be possible on Tuesday
across the Northern Rockies as the system advances eastward.
Another potential hazard to contend with across the western U.S.
over the next couple of days is the threat of critical fire
weather. Gusty winds combined with low relative humidity and dry
fuels may produce conditions ripe for wildfires to spread
uncontrollably throughout northern Nevada in particular.

For the central U.S., autumn is nowhere to be found as high
temperatures rise into potentially record-breaking territory today
and Tuesday. A strong upper-level ridge and persistent southerly
flow will allow for temperatures to rise into the 90s throughout
much of the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest. These warm
temperatures are likely to extend as far north as the Dakotas,
where temperatures are forecast to reach 20 to 30 degrees above
average. A dozen or so daily high temperature records could fall,
mostly found across the northern and central Plains. Elevated to
critical fire weather is also a concern for sections of the
northern High Plains on Tuesday as southerly winds increase in
intensity.

Elsewhere, a cold front dropping south across the Northeast and
Ohio Valley today could spark a few severe thunderstorms. By
Tuesday, this frontal boundary and isolated severe weather threat
will shift into the Mid-Atlantic. Gusty winds and large hail are
expected to be the primary potential weather hazard. Showers and
thunderstorms are also expected to increase in coverage across the
western Gulf Coast and Southern Plains early this week. A few
severe storms are not out of the question on Tuesday as
thunderstorms develop along a dryline situated between the
Oklahoma Panhandle and West Texas.

...Bitterly Cold Temperatures to continue into New Year's Day
across the Northern Rockies/Plains...

...Heavy New Year's Eve to New Year's Day Heavy Snows Threat for
the south-central Great Basin/Rockies...

...Heavy Rain/Convection threat from the Mid-South/Ohio Valley to

...Backside Heavy Snow threat meanwhile shifts from the Central
Plains and Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the southern
Appalachians...

...Multi-day Heavy rain and terrain snow threat Sunday-Tuesday
from the Northwest to North-Central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the 06 UTC GEFS ensemble mean and 00 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/ECMWF ensemble mean that offer a similar synoptic
pattern evolution days 3-7 in a pattern with better than normal
forecast spread and predictability. The composite blend tends to
mitigate small-moderate scales timing and phasing differences with
embedded systems that remains an issue that increases local focus
uncertainty. The latest few runs of the GFS have shown less
stellar run to run continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified ridge built over the east-central Pacific will allow
the digging of a series of potent shortwave troughs and frontal
systems into the West Friday into Saturday along with cold
temperatures and unsettled weather conditions highlighted by
south-central Great Basin/Rockies heavy snows as locally enhanced
by favored terrain. Ejecting upper trough energies in two streams
out from the West will generate systems and enhance an emerging
east-central U.S. precipitation focus with progression out across
the central and eastern U.S. as an upper ridge erodes over the
Southeast. Heavy rains and some local runoff issues may develop
and spread northeastward across the Mid-South and OH
Valley/Northeast to ring in the new year. SPC also offers some
risk of severe weather over the South Friday into Saturday. Arctic
air on the backside will meanwhile spill through the n-central
U.S. to also spread a risk of heavy snow from the central Plains
to the Midwest/Great Lakes. Wavy frontal progression should shift
organized rains more into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast into Sunday
before working offshore. Post-frontal cold air intrusion may then
favor lingering Sunday snow/ice chances from the southern
Appalachians and vicinity up through the Northeast.

Sunday-Tuesday of next week then looks quite active for the
Northwest and north-central California as part of a developing
Omega block over the Northeast Pacific in the form of a deeply
amplified closed upper low/trough digs slowly southward from the
Gulf of Alaska to offshore the Northwest. Expect an increasingly
windy multi-day heavy precipitation episode with moderate to heavy
coastal rains and heavy mountain snows inland from the Cascades to
the Sierra.

...Bitterly Cold Temperatures to continue into New Year's Day
across the Northern Rockies/Plains...

...Heavy  New Year's Day Heavy Snows Threat for the south-central
Great Basin/Rockies...

...Heavy Rain/Convection threat from the Mid-South/Ohio Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast New Year's Eve into New Year's Day...
...Backside Heavy Snow threat meanwhile shifts from the Central
Plains and Midwest/Great Lakes/Northeast down through the southern
Appalachians...

...Multi-day Heavy rain and terrain snow threat Sunday-Tuesday
from the Northwest to North-Central California...


...Guidance and Predictability Assessment...

The WPC model blend was comprised of equal parts of the 12Z
ECWMF/EC ensemble mean/CMC/GEFS mean as they continued to have
similar pattern evolution and maintained continuity with the
previous forecast.
The synoptic pattern for the extended period are still showing
above average predictability. The composite blend tends to
mitigate small-moderate scales timing and phasing differences with
embedded systems that remains an issue that increases local focus
uncertainty.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A series of shortwaves will dig through the amplified ridge over
the east-central Pacific Ocean; which will send frontal systems
into the West Friday into Saturday in addition to cold
temperatures across the south-central Great Basin and Rockies with
locally enhanced snowfall. Ejecting upper trough energies in two
streams out from the West will generate systems and enhance an
emerging east-central U.S. precipitation focus with progression
out across the central and eastern U.S. as an upper ridge erodes
over the Southeast. Deep moisture streaming into the frontal
system over the central/south-central portion of the country will
lead to heavy rainfall and localized runoff. Flooding concerns may
be elevated especially across the Mid-South and Ohio
Valley/Northeast to ring in the new year. Some of these storms
across this region may also be severe, per SPC.

Colder air will filter into the central U.S. causing temperatures
to significantly drop and will also spread the risk for heavy snow
from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region. Wavy frontal
progression should shift organized rains more into the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast into Sunday before working offshore. With
the colder air making its way toward the Appalachians, lingering
Sunday snow/ice chances from the southern Appalachians and
vicinity up through the Northeast may be possible.

Sunday-Tuesday of next week will be active for a majority of the
Pacific Northwest and the north-central parts of California as the
upper level pattern transitions as part of a developing Omega
block over the Northeast Pacific in the form of a deeply amplified
closed upper low/trough digs slowly southward from the Gulf of
Alaska to offshore the Northwest. This will result in a windy and
heavy precipitation couple of days. Moderate to heavy coastal
rains and heavy mountain snows inland from the Cascades to the
Sierra can be expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1243 AM CST Wed Dec 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will continue to be confined to the southern
High Plains and into parts of the southern Plains. Today's synoptic
regime is expected to be somewhat similar to Tuesday's. An
upper-level shortwave trough (currently noted over the Four Corners)
will pass over the region during the morning hours, with residual
gradient winds in the afternoon. Regional VWP observations already
hint at the influence of this wave on low to mid-level flow with
strengthening winds noted over the past few hours. However, one
notable difference is the weaker lee trough and surface pressure
falls over the region compared to 24 hours ago. The southward surge
of a colder air mass into central OK over the past 12 hours will
likely dampen the surface mass response to the wave, and may delay
the onset of breezier winds until diurnal warming begins to deepen
the boundary layer. Most model solutions support this idea and
suggest peak sustained winds between 15-25 mph will occur within the
18-22 UTC window with wind gusts up to 30-40 mph possible.

Regardless of the exact wind timing, dewpoint values across the
southern High Plains are generally similar to observed values early
Tuesday. With similar flow patterns and wind speeds expected today,
conditions should be comparable to Tuesday when widespread elevated
conditions, and brief/localized critical, conditions occurred. This
notion is supported by latest guidance with ensembles maintaining
high probabilities for RH values in the 15-25% range across the
region. The exact coverage of elevated conditions remains somewhat
uncertain with northern/eastern extent due to the colder air mass
currently in place across central/northern OK into KS. Drier/windier
solutions hint at the best potential for periods of critical
conditions lies across the Rolling Plains of northwest TX, but these
conditions will likely remain fairly localized. A few fires were
noted Tuesday afternoon across western/central OK. These confirm
that regional fuels are receptive and will once again support a fire
weather concern today.

...Bitterly cold wind chills in the northern Rockies and High
Plains today, more heavy mountain snow from the Sierra Nevada to
the central Rockies...

...Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today
and Thursday; urban and flash flooding possible...

...Spring-like weather to stick around in the South; Slight Risks
for severe storms and Excessive Rainfall posted in parts of the
Deep South today...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
Beneath the troughing pattern in the West, chilly temperatures are
most common with dangerously cold wind chills located in the
Northern Plains. Wind Chill Warnings and Advisories were issued
from Montana and parts of the Dakotas to northern Minnesota where
wind chills will range anywhere from -30 to -50 degrees this
morning. In addition to the cold, accumulating snowfall throughout
the mountain ranges of the West will be common with heavy
accumulations expected for some. The heaviest snow totals are
forecast from the southern Sierra Nevada and the Transverse range
of southern California to the Wasatch and central Rockies. Snow
totals in the highest peaks of these regions will be measured in
feet, which combined with whiteout conditions in these areas will
result in hazardous and, at times, impassable travel conditions.
Closer to southern California, a storm system rounding the base of
the upper trough in the West is funneling Pacific moisture into
the Los Angeles and San Diego metro areas. Excessive rainfall
potential is high enough to warrant a Slight Risk, meaning there
is a threat for flash flooding today and into Thursday. Lastly,
High Wind watches were posted for southern Wyoming this Thursday
as strong cross winds could make for hazardous travel conditions
for light weight and high profile vehicles.

Farther east, the anchored ridge atop the southeastern U.S. shows
no sign in relinquishing its spring-like regime in the South and
East-Central U.S.. Numerous record warm lows and highs are
anticipated from the Southeast coast to the Rio Grande of South
Texas today. More of the same is expected in the Southeast on
Thursday with highs in the 70s and lows that are 20 to 40 degrees
above normal. An Elevated Risk for fire weather is also in place
for portions of the southern High Plains today. In terms of
precipitation, moist southerly flow and increasing instability
levels will lead to an increasingly favorable environment for
severe weather. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced
Risk (threat level 3/5) for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
while a Slight Risk (threat level 2/5) stretches from southern
Arkansas to the southern Appalachians. Highly anomalous moisture
content also supports the threat for Excessive Rainfall, thus
leading to the issuance of a Slight Risk for the Tennessee Valley
today due to a heightened chance for localized flash flooding.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will remain possible across a
broad portions of the South on Thursday, but the severe and flash
flood threat will be lower compared to today's threat. Meanwhile,
a little farther north, light rain and snow showers across the
Lower Great Lakes Wednesday evening. A coating to 2 inches is
possible from southern Iowa to the northern Illinois and Indiana
with a light but treacherous glaze of ice possible from northeast
Missouri to central Illinois and Indiana.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Wed Dec 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist across parts of the High Plains
and southern Plains for Thursday. Southwesterly flow aloft over the
central/southern Rockies will support lee troughing through Thursday
afternoon. As a result, south to southwesterly winds are forecast to
increase through the day with winds between 15-20 mph common. Low to
mid-level flow will feature somewhat above-seasonal wind speeds (up
to the 90th percentile at 700 mb), which may support wind gusts up
to 25-40 mph across the TX Panhandle and western OK during the
afternoon hours. Current indications are that downslope
warming/drying effects will be most pronounced across the TX/OK
Panhandles into southeast CO where RH reductions down to 15-25% may
be common.

Further south, weak moisture return could limit the degree of RH
reductions, but recent guidance appears to be initializing too moist
upstream compared to observed dewpoints. This implies that
conditions may be drier than currently depicted in guidance, and a
southward expansion of the Elevated may be warranted in subsequent
outlooks if observations trend in this direction. Across the broader
region, mid to high-level cloud cover is forecast to increase, owing
to ascent ahead of a shortwave trough to the west and modest
mid-level warm advection. The impact of these clouds on diurnal
heating and the fire weather threat will largely depend on their
coverage and placement, which is not overly certain at this time.
Nonetheless, elevated conditions appear probable from western OK
into east-central CO where fuels will remain receptive due to
continued warm/dry conditions over the next 48 hours.

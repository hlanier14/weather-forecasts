US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 30 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, mid-level high pressure is forecast to strengthe=
n
over the West where above normal temperatures are likely. Mid-level low
pressure is expected to result in near to below normal temperatures across =
the
Corn Belt, Great Lakes, and Northeast throughout much of week-2. Following =
the
heavy rainfall and flooding associated with Ida, a drier pattern is
anticipated
for much of the central and eastern U.S. However, a tropical system could
emerge from the Caribbean Sea later next week. Mid-level low pressure cente=
red
over the Bering Sea is expected to bring above normal precipitation to
northwestern Mainland Alaska during early to mid-September.

HAZARDS

Flooding possible for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the western Gulf Coast, Tue-Thu, Sep=
 7-
9.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the southern Great Plains and lo=
wer
Mississippi Valley, Tue-Fri, Sep 7-10.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the western U.S., Tue-Thu, Sep 7=
-9.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Lakes,
Tue, Sep 7.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 02 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 06:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!oCkLup2PVuww_E7ORZ-t4-iCu-HdmwwzzqxD1JB8spP8z-IOtyN4QP2jeCRGJ=
T2VAtb8pL-i$

FOR TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 07 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 13: Major Hurricane Ida made
landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Aug 30. Heavy to excessive rainfa=
ll
(6 to 15 inches, or more) accompanied Ida as it tracked inland across
southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result, moderate to major rive=
r
flooding is ongoing across the lower Mississippi Valley. Flooding along the
smaller streams is likely to end prior to week-2 but flooding may linger al=
ong
larger rivers through at least the early part of week-2.



A broad area of low pressure is expected to form over the southern Caribbea=
n
Sea during the next several days. Environmental conditions appear to be
favorable for slow tropical cyclone (TC) development. The deterministic
Canadian model remains consistent and most bullish with a TC tracking into =
the
Gulf of Mexico and eventually affecting the western Gulf Coast early in
week-2.
Although the GFS and ECMWF models continue to favor a tropical wave with
little
or no TC development, a slight risk of heavy rainfall is posted for the
western
Gulf Coast and the lower Mississippi Valley since this region will be prone=
 to
additional flooding. Also, a cold front shifting south may trigger locally
heavy rainfall there regardless of if a TC tracks north from the Caribbean
Sea.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldron Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned more
than 150,000 acres and is only 13% contained. Critical fire weather conditi=
ons
with gusty winds and low relative humidity are forecast prior to week-2. As=
 a
500-hPa ridge amplifies over western North America heading into week-2, abo=
ve
normal temperatures are likely throughout the West. The ridging aloft is
expected to peak in strength during the early part of week-2, supporting a
slight risk of excessive heat across parts of California and Oregon. Maximu=
m
temperatures may exceed 100 degrees F across the Central Valley of Californ=
ia
and reach 90 degrees F as far north as Portland, Oregon. A slight risk of
excessive heat is also posted for parts of the southern Great Plains and lo=
wer
Mississippi Valley where heat index values could be near or above 105F. Wit=
h
more than one million power outages currently reported across Louisiana,
predicted above normal temperatures are a concern for residents that remain
without power into next week.



A cold front is forecast to progress southward across the central U.S. duri=
ng
the Labor Day weekend. Behind this front, below normal temperatures are lik=
ely
across the Corn Belt and Great Lakes. Based on the ECMWF reforecast tool, a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for northern parts =
of
Michigan and Wisconsin where there is a 20 percent chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the climatological
distribution and 40 degrees F on Sep 7.

portions of the Gulf Coast, through the Tennessee Valley, Upper
Ohio Valley, Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and far southern
New England as Ida continues to push northeast...

...Tropical moisture from the remnants of Nora will bring heavy
rains and flash flooding threats to the Southwest...

...Windy conditions will pose a fire weather threat from Northern
California into the Northern Great Basin and Pacific Northwest...


While the winds with Ida are expected to continue to weaken as it
presses northeastward, the heavy rains and flooding threat will be
unabated over the next two days.  Widespread heavy rains are
likely from portions of the Central Gulf coast, through the
Tennessee Valley Upper Ohio Valley, Central Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic and far southern New England.  Across much of these
regions rainfall totals of 3-8 inches are expected, resulting in
the potential for life threatening flash flooding and river
flooding over the next two days.  The heaviest overall storm
totals with Ida will likely be along the central Gulf coastal
regions where totals in excessive of a foot will be common.  In
addition to the heavy rain and flooding threat, severe weather is
possible over the next two days across portion of the central to
eastern Gulf coast into the Southeast with the greatest threat
being from tornadoes and high winds.

A tropical heavy rain threat also on tap for portions of the
Southwest from southeast California, into Arizona, far southern
Nevada, Utah, western Colorado and western New Mexico.  Much above
average tropical moisture from the remnants of Nora that moved
into the western Mexican coast, will stream northward into the
Southwest.  Scattered thunderstorms will begin in this moist
tropical airmass Monday afternoon, becoming more widespread
Tuesday and Wednesday.  This will result in the potential for
widespread heavy precipitation totals and an increasing threat of
flash flooding over the next two days.

The tropical moisture from Nora will not be reaching areas of
Central to Northern California, the Northern Great Basin and
Pacific Northwest that continue to experience Extreme to
Exceptional drought conditions.  A strong front forecast to push
from the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Great Basin and
Northern Rockies region will have little if any precipitation with
it.  However, strong winds associated with this front will raise
the fire weather threat from northeast portions of California,
into portions of the Northern Great Basin, Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies. This front will, however, provide cooler than
average temperatures over the next two days across the Northwest.
Below average temperatures also expected where there is the
aforementioned heavy rains threat across the Southwest and large
portions of the east.

Mid-Atlantic to Southern New England Thursday...

threat into Thursday...

for the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the NBM along with emphasis with the
CMC/ECWMF/EC ensembles as they handled the heavy rain areas
associated with NHC tropical tracks for Nora and Ida fairly well.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ida is still forecast to be a well organized post-tropical cyclone
that will be lifting from the Mid-Atlantic to offshore southern
New England early in the extended period. Uncertain interaction
from northern stream energies may alter Ida's track as it pulls
offshore the New England coast. Deep tropical moisture wrapping
into the low, within the right entrance region of a potent upper
jet, will spread moderate to heavy rainfall across parts of the
Northeast. Cell training and terrain will significantly enhance
the runoff/flood threat within a well defined precipitation axis.
There may be an increased threat for flash flooding for this part
of the country.

Nora is expected to be history before the extended forecast
begins, however the remnant moisture aloft will transport
northward into Arizona, New Mexico and points to the north.
Showers and thunderstorms will linger across the Southwest
U.S./Rockies into Thursday before the airmass begins to dry.

Elsewhere, ample northern stream upper troughing will meanwhile
dig a wavy and modestly unsettling/cooling front through the West
and downstream across the north-central states. Upper dynamics and
frontal convergence/progression should act to focus some locally
heavy convection/rainfall as enhanced by embedded impulses/frontal
waves as fueled by instability and frontal moisture pooling,
including some monsoonal influx Thursday and Friday. There may be
enhanced rainfall that setups up over the Dakotas and parts of
Minnesota and Iowa.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0212 PM CDT Mon Aug 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed. A
dry thunderstorm or two is possible across parts of northeast UT,
northwest CO, and far southern WY late Tuesday night into early
Wednesday as monsoonal moisture spreads north. However, confidence
in this potential is too low for highlights. See the previous
discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 08/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Mon Aug 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level trough will continue east on Tuesday. The strongest
mid-level winds will exist across Idaho into western and central
Montana. Moderately strong flow will still remain across the
northern Great Basin on the southern flank of the trough. At the
surface, a cold front is expected to push through the Northwest and
into the far northern Great Basin. A lee cyclone will deepen in
eastern Nevada.

...Northern Nevada...
With a similar pattern to Monday, critical fire weather is again
expected during the afternoon. Moderately strong mid-level winds
will combine with enhanced surface winds ahead of the approaching
front. 20-25 mph sustained winds are expected in the lee of the
terrain with 15-20 mph winds extending farther east into northeast
Nevada.

...Idaho/Montana...
Winds from southern Idaho into southwest Montana could reach near 20
mph. Though surface conditions will be dry, fuels remain marginally
receptive to fire spread. No highlights will be added this outlook.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon August 30 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 05 - 09 2021

Dynamical models are in good agreement regarding an amplified 500-hPa
circulation pattern forecast over North America during the 6-10 day period.
Troughs are predicted to the northwest of Alaska and south of Alaska over t=
he
North Pacific. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of
Mainland Alaska in the 0Z and 6Z high resolution GFS runs and near zero in =
the
GEFS, ECWMF and Canadian ensemble means and the 0Z ECMWF high resolution ru=
n.
A
positive tilted ridge is predicted over the western CONUS and central Canad=
a
and a trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS by model solutions.

Below normal temperatures are favored over northwestern Mainland Alaska, du=
e
to
potential increased clouds with enhanced onshore flow, while above normal
temperatures are more likely for remaining areas of Alaska, supported by th=
e
temperature consolidation and most dynamical model temperature forecast too=
ls.
Above normal temperatures are likely for most of the western CONUS, from th=
e
Pacific coast to the Northern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, under a
predicted ridge. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for the Midw=
est
and Northeast, as well as the Tennessee Valley and eastern Gulf Coast state=
s,
under a predicted trough. Above normal temperatures are likely for parts of
the
Southeast Atlantic coast, supported by the temperature consolidation foreca=
st
tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska
ahead of a predicted trough. Below normal precipitation is favored for the
Aleutians and parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska, supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool. Below normal precipitation is predicted f=
or
much of the northwestern and central CONUS under a predicted ridge. Dynamic=
al
models predict enhanced moisture into parts of the Southwest to varying
degrees, leading to enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation fo=
r
Southern California and Nevada and parts of western Arizona. Near to above
normal precipitation is likely for the eastern Great Lakes region and much =
of
the Northeast, due to a predicted trough. The ECMWF precipitation tools
predict
drier conditions than the GEFS precipitation tools for the Tennessee Valley
and
eastern Gulf Coast states, leading to a forecast of near normal precipitati=
on
for these areas. Dynamical model precipitation tools agree on a forecast of
enhanced probabilities of below normal precipitation for parts of the
Southeast
Atlantic coast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, a=
nd
10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 07 - 13 2021

While a generally low amplitude mid-level circulation pattern is forecast
across North America during week 2, large-scale features resemble the 6-10 =
day
period forecasts. Weak ridging is forecast over the western CONUS in the
ECMWF,
GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, while a trough and negative 500-hPa heigh=
t
anomalies persists over the eastern CONUS. Dynamical model forecasts genera=
lly
predict troughing extending from the Bering Sea to the Aleutian Islands in
week
2, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over eastern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

While there are considerable differences among the tools, with an increase =
in
uncertainty in the week 2 period, the predicted temperature and precipitati=
on
patterns in week 2 are generally similar to the 6-10 day period forecasts,
with
somewhat lower probabilities. Below normal temperatures are favored for par=
ts
of northwestern Mainland Alaska ahead of a predicted trough, while near to
above normal temperatures are favored for remaining areas of the state,
supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Above normal temperatures =
are
likely for most of the western CONUS, under ridging and slightly positive
500-hPa height anomalies. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for
most of the eastern CONUS, under a persistent trough. Above normal
temperatures
are favored for parts of the Southeast Atlantic coast, supported by the
temperature consolidation tool.

Slightly enhanced chances of above normal precipitation continue for parts =
of
northwestern Mainland Alaska, ahead of a predicted trough, while below norm=
al
precipitation continues to be favored for the Aleutians and the southwester=
n
coast of Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts o=
f
the Pacific Northwest, across the Northern Rockies, and into most of the Gr=
eat
Plains region under a predicted ridge. Near to above normal precipitation i=
s
favored for western areas of the Southwest region as well as the Great Basi=
n,
with continued moisture flow into the region in week 2. Above normal
precipitation is favored for parts of the Northeast ahead of the predicted
trough. The precipitation consolidation tool supports below normal
precipitation for eastern areas of the Tennessee Valley and the southern
Atlantic coast states.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted low amplitude mid-level circulation pattern and uncertainty in =
the
temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0112 AM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level winds will persist across parts of the Northwest
and northern Rockies today. Moderately strong mid-level flow will
stretch as far south as northern Nevada. A surface front will move
through the Northwest and reach northern Nevada and central Idaho by
the end of the period.

...Nevada...
Critical weather is expected to occur once again across a similar
area as Monday. Mid-level winds will combine with an increasing
surface pressure gradient of the approaching boundary to bring 20-25
mph winds to the immediate lee of the northern Sierra. RH could
approach single digits in some locations with 10-15% more broadly
occurring. Similar RH will extend into northeastern Nevada, but
winds speeds will be less at 15-20 mph. Elevated conditions are
expected across the remainder of northern Nevada.

...Northern Rockies and Wyoming...
Fuel receptiveness based on ERCs in most areas is at or below
normal. Though winds will likely reach 15-20 mph, with some areas of
20+ mph in central Idaho into southwest Montana, highlights will be
withheld. RH of 15-20% may lead to locally elevated concerns where
fuels are drier.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper trough in the Northwest will begin to lift to the
northeast on Wednesday. Moderately strong mid-level winds will
remain across the region into the northern Great Basin. With the
trough lifting away, the surface boundary in the northern Great
Basin will stall. A lee trough will develop in the northern and
central High Plains leading to strong southerly winds in those
regions.

...Central/northern Sierra...
Remnant mid-level winds and a adequate surface pressure gradient
will help drive 15-20 mph winds in the immediate lee of the terrain.
10-15% RH appears probable during the afternoon. Given some terrain
augmented winds, areas of near critical to locally critical fire
weather may occur. However, most areas will see elevated concerns.

...Central High Plains...
Winds are expected to reach 20-25 mph across the region. The primary
uncertainty will be how low RH will fall and for how broad an area.
Given the fairly persistent southerly surface winds the last several
days, it would seem that the typically dry model solutions may too
aggressive in the amount of drying/mixing. Furthermore, there is
expected to be increasing moisture throughout the profile. Given
that moisture and the cloud cover that is expected to occur with it,
locally elevated conditions are currently all that is expected. The
primary area for this would likely be along the Kansas/Colorado
border. No highlights will be added this outlook.

300 AM EDT Tue Aug 31 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Sep 03 2021 - 12Z Tue Sep 07 2021

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles offer a reasonably similar larger scale upper
flow pattern evolution through much of the medium range, but offer
more rampant embedded system and local weather focus variance from
run to run that may be best addressed with increased reliance of
more steady ensemble mean guidance, especially from the weekend
into next week. Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite
was primarily derived from a GFS/ECMWF and ensemble mean composite
day 3/Fri before switching to primarily the ECMWF ensemble mean
and the National Blend of Models onward for days 4-7. This
maintains best WPC continuity.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ida is forecast by WPC to become a well organized post-tropical
cyclone that will be lifting/exiting offshore New England Friday.
Uncertain interaction from northern stream energies may alter
Ida's track and development as a maritime hazard as collaborated
with OPC. Ida is expected to be absorbed into a well organized
northern stream low over the Canadian Maritimes whose wrapping
rains may prove slow to exit northern New England into Saturday
given closed low/upper trough support and proximity. A moderating
trailing front will settle down into the Southeast.

Upstream, a continued series of northern stream upper troughs will
force several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out
though the north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next
week into the east-central U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced convection from the central Plains to Upper Midwest
Friday, with more modest potential downstream into the
east-central U.S. in the wake of Ida.

Meanwhile, lingering deepened moisture from Nora may fuel some
locally heavy downpours as enhanced by terrain over the southern
Rockies Friday into Saturday around the western periphery of a
potent south-central U.S. upper ridge. The ridge shifts slowly
westward over the Southwest forcing a modest monsoonal channel
back into southern NM/AZ/CA to the east of an upper trough off CA
into next week. Meanwhile, the breakthrough approach of northeast
Pacific systems into western Canada and the Northwest U.S. will
foster advent of a periodically wet pattern into western WA from
this weekend into next week.

...Tropical Depression IDA is forecast to slowly weaken while
moving northeastward with a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall
from Southern Appalachians/Tennessee Valley and Ohio
Valley/Central Appalachians through Wednesday morning...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall associated with
IDA over the Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Wednesday
into Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast into the Southern Appalachians and over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday morning...

...There is a Sight Risk of excessive rainfall over the Southwest
into the Central/Southern Rockies as former T. C. NORA=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDS
moisture moves over the region through Thursday morning...

Tropical Depression IDA is forecast to slowly weaken and become a
Post-Tropical Cyclone as the system continues to move
northeastward into parts of the Mid-Atlantic by Thursday morning.
However, IDA will continue to produce heavy rain along the path
into Thursday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall from Southern Appalachians/Tennessee Valley and
Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians through Wednesday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers along the track.

Furthermore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast into the Southern
Appalachians through Wednesday morning.  The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

As IDA moves into the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, Heavy rain will
develop over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into the Northeast.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall from Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast from
Wednesday into Thursday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Moreover, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers along the
system=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs path. Additionally, the SPC has issued a Slight R=
isk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday
into Thursday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Meanwhile, a quasi-stationary front extending from the
Mid-Atlantic westward to the Middle Mississippi Valley, then
northwestward into the Northern High Plains, will have pooling
moisture and upper-level impulses flow along the boundary on
Tuesday.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday
morning unrelated to IDA.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition, showers and
thunderstorms will develop along the Gulf Coast with the very
moist air in place from Tuesday into Thursday morning.

Elsewhere, moisture associated with what was once Tropical Cyclone
NORA will move over the Southwest into parts of the Great Basin
and Central Rockies on Tuesday into Thursday, producing
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Thursday morning.

The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the
most vulnerable Tuesday into Thursday morning.  Additionally, the
fire weather threat increases over Northern California into parts
of Idaho and Wyoming as Red Flag Warnings have been issued in
these areas. Air Quality Alerts have also been published over much
of the Pacific Northwest and California as well as parts of
Wyoming and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.

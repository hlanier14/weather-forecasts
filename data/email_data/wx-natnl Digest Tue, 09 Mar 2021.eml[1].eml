Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1013 AM CST Mon Mar 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

Much of the previous forecast remains largely on track. Mid-level
clouds are present across the southern Rockies and are currently
overspreading portions of the southern High Plains. These clouds are
expected to limit surface heating/boundary-layer mixing to a degree.
Nonetheless, at least low-end Elevated conditions are still expected
across portions of the central/southern High Plains and southern
Arizona/New Mexico as limited boundary-layer heating and downslope
flow encourages patchy 20% RH amidst sustained winds over 15 mph by
mid afternoon.

Farther east however, visible satellite indicates clear skies, with
METAR observations indicating RH dropping to 35-40%. While the
ambient low-level airmass is not quite as dry as yesterday,
continued heating should promote enough boundary-layer mixing to
support RH dropping to near 25% in spots. Given multiple hours of
sustained 15-25 mph southwesterly surface winds and fuels receptive
to fire spread, an Elevated area has been maintained.

Lastly, with surface high pressure persisting across the eastern
U.S., much of the southeast towards the Mid Atlantic are expected to
see widespread 25-35% RH by afternoon peak heating. Fire weather
highlights have been withheld given the lack of stronger winds.
However, localized wildfire concerns exist given the low RH and
presence of drying finer fuels.

..Squitieri.. 03/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CST Mon Mar 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active fire weather pattern will begin today and is expected to
persist well into the middle of the work week. This will mainly be
driven by persistent upper-level troughing over the West Coast with
strong mid and upper-level west/southwesterly flow across the
Southwest into the southern High Plains. Consequently, surface
pressure falls over the inter-mountain West and along the lee of the
Rockies will help augment regional surface pressure gradients and
downslope flow. For today, areas of elevated fire weather conditions
are expected, particularly for southeast AZ into the
southern/central High Plains and eastern Kansas.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
The latest surface observations show winds already increasing to
around 15 mph across the TX/OK Panhandles in response to the onset
of lee troughing across eastern CO. This trend will continue through
the day as upper-level flow increases over the Rockies (likely aided
by an embedded shortwave impulse noted over southern CA). While
modest moisture return is ongoing across the TX Panhandle, 15-25 mph
downslope flow should allow 15-25% RH to overspread northeast NM
into eastern CO and adjacent areas of the TX/OK Panhandles and KS.
Elevated fire weather conditions appear likely, and brief critical
conditions are possible. Additionally, elevated conditions may
extend as far north as northeast CO and southeast WY, but confidence
in RH reductions diminishes this far north.

...Southwest...
Dry conditions have been noted across much of AZ over the past few
days with afternoon RH in the teens and low 20s. Minimal moisture
return into the region will result in another day of dry conditions
with similar RH reductions. A weak surface low, noted over central
NV, will deepen as it moves to the northeast, resulting in
strengthening surface winds up to 25 mph across northern AZ and
southern UT. While elevated meteorological conditions are expected,
fuels remain below critical thresholds for the majority of the
region. To the south, fuels are more receptive and will support an
elevated fire weather concern. Relative humidity values will likely
fall into the low teens and single digits. However, this region will
be on the periphery of the stronger mid-level flow and displaced
from the tighter surface pressure gradient, suggesting that 15-20
mph winds will be more common.

...Eastern Kansas...
Another day of breezy conditions is expected across OK and KS due to
lee troughing to the west with a persistent surface high to the
east. While the strongest gradient winds will likely reside across
central/western KS (where modest moisture advection is expected),
sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely for eastern KS.
Regional 00 UTC soundings reveal dry boundary layers with minimal
moisture improvements upstream from eastern KS (across OK and TX).
Observed relative humidity values were lower yesterday (Saturday)
than forecast by most guidance, and a similar trend is possible
today given a similar synoptic regime. With receptive fuels already
in place, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Southeast and the Carolinas...
Dry conditions will continue across the Southeast for today with
afternoon RH values falling well into the 20s, and possibly high
teens, from central AL into the western Carolinas. A few locations
have cured fuels that could support a wildfire threat, but surface
high pressure will limit wind speeds and the overall fire weather
concern.

...Record high temperatures possible Tuesday across portions of
the Northern and Central Plains into the Upper Mississippi
Valley...

...Much above average temperatures likely Tuesday and Wednesday
across much of the central and eastern U.S., while below average
temperatures expected from the west coast into the Great Basin...

...Much needed precipitation on tap along the west coast from
Oregon into California...

...Heavy snows likely Tuesday night into early Wednesday across
portions of the Central Rockies into portions of the Northern High
Plains...

Spring like temperatures expected across much of the central to
eastern U.S. over the next two days.  Temperatures across these
regions are forecast to be much above average with highs in the
60s and 70s across many areas.  The greatest departures from
average expected over portions of the Central to Northern Plains
into the Upper Mississippi Valley where high temperatures are
expected to be 30 to 40 degrees above average.  Across these areas
there is the potential for record high minimum temperatures
Tuesday morning and record high maximum temperatures Tuesday
afternoon.

In contrast, temperatures are expected to be below average over
the next few days along the west coast, inland into the Great
Basin.  However, these temperatures will not be as anomalous as
the warmth across the middle section of the nation.  More
importantly for the west coast, much needed precipitation is
expected from coastal Oregon, southward through much of
California, with snow totals of 1 to 2 feet through the Sierra
into the northwest California coastal mountains and lower
elevation rains.  Much of this region is in moderate to extreme
drought with precipiation much below average over the past several
months.

A storm system pushing through the Central Rockies into the
Northern High Plains Tuesday night into Wednesday morning is
expected to produce heavy snows from the mountains of Utah and
Wyoming, eastward into the high plains of Wyoming, far southwest
South Dakota and northwest Nebraska.  This snow will be falling
across areas that are forecast to have much above average
temperatures both Monday and Tuesday.

...Late week through weekend heavy rain threat from the
south-central Plains to the Lower Ohio Valley/Mid-South...
...Late week/weekend heavy snow threat over the central Rockies
and High Plains...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A vigorous upper trough with embedded closed low expected to track
rather slowly from California/Nevada through the Southwest and
into the Plains will be a prominent focus of the forecast late
this week into the start of next week. This system will initially
support areas of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow over
southern California and portions of the Great Basin. Then a
favorable system track, deformation, and possibly a couple days of
fairly strong upslope flow suggest increasing potential for a
significant heavy snow event over the central Rockies and High
Plains.  This system has decent confidence into at least the first
part of the weekend. However rapidly increasing model/ensemble
spread for evolution of energy within an upstream Pacific trough
lowers confidence in how much upper troughing (and associated
precipitation coverage/amounts) may ultimately reach the West late
in the period. This issue in turn begins to affect the evolution
of the Southwest system once it reaches the Plains. Farther east a
departing Upper Great Lakes wave will anchor a cold front that
crosses the eastern U.S. (with support from amplified northern
stream upper trough passage) but settles into the central
Plains/Southeast. Interaction of this front with Gulf moisture and
instability--and then reinforcement as the Southwest system tracks
into the Plains--will likely promote a multi-day threat for
locally enhanced rainfall and training convection. Ahead of the
cold front, upper ridging will support much above normal
temperatures for the East into later this week.

The updated forecast for the Southwest into Plains system is
generally a mere refinement incorporating the best consensus of
latest data. Recent GFS/GEFS trends have generally been more in
favor of the slower ECMWF/ECMWF mean but the GEFS mean component
favored the 00Z cycle as the 06Z version returned to a somewhat
faster timing. Model/ensemble spread and recent behavior leads to
rather low confidence for how flow with the approaching Pacific
trough may separate and thus what the resulting shortwave
(possibly upper low) looks like as it heads into the West late in
the period. GFS/GEFS solutions have tended to favor bringing a
deeper and more amplified trough into the West while ECMWF/ECMWF
ensembles have been more inconsistent. It take some time to see
whether it is mere coincidence that the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF have
ended up with an evolution similar to latest GFS runs. Given the
uncertainty, the favored blend reflects only a portion of the
deepening trend for the incoming Pacific trough--which also leads
to a northward nudge for the Plains system late in the period
(furthered in the 12Z GFS/ECMWF). For an alternative
Pacific/western U.S. evolution, the past couple CMC runs pull off
so much energy over the Pacific that the West stays under an upper
ridge.

Model consensus at the start of the period fairly quickly phased
out 00Z CMC/UKMET input due to developing differences over the
Pacific and elsewhere, leading into a 06Z GFS/00Z GEFS and 00Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean blend that also added a little 12Z/07 ECMWF late
in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The system tracking through the Southwest and into the Plains
should produce the heaviest snow over the central Rockies and High
Plains toward the end of the week through the weekend, after first
producing areas of locally enhanced to possibly heavy rain/higher
elevation snow over the Great Basin/Southwest late this week.
Typical guidance errors 4-5 days out in time suggest some ongoing
uncertainty for exact track of the system and location of highest
totals but in general the guidance signals are getting stronger
for the potential of a significant central Rockies/High Plains
heavy snow event. Some snow may extend farther northeastward over
the central U.S. from late weekend into early next week depending
on system evolution and track. Confidence for this latter part of
the forecast is much lower though.

Model/ensemble consensus is highlighting an area from the
south-central Plains into and perhaps somewhat south of the Lower
Ohio Valley for highest five-day rainfall totals during the
period. Late this week into the weekend there will be a persistent
flow of Gulf moisture into a front that stalls over the
south-central Plains/Mississippi Valley while the rest of the
front crosses the East. Arrival of height falls aloft from the
Southwest and associated surface system will provide reinforcement
for heavy rainfall potential later in the weekend/early next week.
Meanwhile the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the threat for
severe thunderstorms over and a little east of the Southern
Plains. Check the latest outlooks for more information as severe
weather details come into clearer focus.

Expect the Northwest to see an increase of rain/mountain snow and
a cooling trend by the weekend into early next week with the
arrival of an upper trough and cold front. The details of timing,
coverage, and amounts are uncertain at this time given guidance
spread for specifics of the upper trough.

The warm sector ahead of the Plains into eastern U.S. front late
this week will contain much above normal temperatures.  The Great
Lakes/Northeast may see plus 15-25F anomalies for daytime highs on
Thursday while a broader northeast-southwest band of plus 20-30F
anomalies for morning lows may exist Thursday-Friday.  Daily
records will likely be more numerous for morning lows (where they
hold as the min through the end of the calendar day) than for
daytime highs.  Meanwhile the system tracking from the Southwest
into the Plains will drop highs to as much as 10-20F below normal
from about the southern half of the West into the central
Rockies/High Plains.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Small adjustments to
the Critical and two Elevated delineations have been made based on
the latest guidance consensus. Questions remain regarding how well
the boundary layer will mix during the afternoon across portions of
the Critical delineation and points south/southwestward given the
potential for increasing mid-level cloud cover. Some of the latest
guidance suggests that RH minima may struggle to reach 15-20% by
afternoon peak heating. While Critical surface meteorological
conditions may be on the low end, 25+ mph sustained southwesterly
winds coinciding with fuels that are at least modestly receptive to
fire spread suggest that the current fire weather highlights are
still warranted. Otherwise, areas of 25-40% surface RH are still
expected by afternoon peak heating across portions of the eastern
U.S., though no fire weather highlights have been introduced given
the lack of stronger surface winds.

..Squitieri.. 03/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CST Mon Mar 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level flow is forecast to increase over the southern and
central Rockies over the next 48 hours. As this occurs, a lee
trough/surface low will likely develop over eastern CO and may begin
to shift into the central Plains. Southwesterly winds behind the
trailing surface trough will support downslope warming and drying
across the southern High Plains and southern AZ/NM. Additionally, a
weak cold front will likely begin pushing southeastward behind the
surface low across SD and NE. Breezy post-frontal conditions will
introduce fire weather concerns across a region that has seen
warm/dry conditions in recent days.

...Southern High Plains and southern Arizona/New Mexico...
Recent guidance continues to show reasonable agreement in the
potential for elevated to critical fire weather conditions from the
greater Panhandles region southwestward into southern AZ and NM. The
strongest mid-level flow is currently expected across eastern NM
into the OK/TX Panhandles. Deep boundary-layer mixing by late
afternoon should capitalize on the stronger flow and support
sustained winds near or above 20 mph with frequent gusts up to 30
mph (perhaps up to 40 mph). This will also help relative humidity
values fall into the low teens. Localized critical conditions will
be possible elsewhere within the broader elevated risk area where
15-20% RH will be common. Fuel reports from this region indicate
that fuels are either already receptive or are curing, which should
support a fire weather concern.

...Nebraska...
Breezy and dry post-frontal conditions appear likely in the wake of
a cold front Tuesday afternoon across southwest SD into northwest
NE. Weakness of cold advection behind the front should allow
temperatures to warm sufficiently by late afternoon for relative
humidity values to fall into the low 20s and perhaps teens. After a
few days of warm and dry conditions, fine fuels across this region
have cured with 10-hour fuel moisture values in the 5-10% range.
This should be sufficient to support an elevated fire weather
concern.

...Southeast...
Persistent surface high pressure will continue to limit winds across
much of the Southeast for Tuesday. While weak winds will mitigate
the fire weather concern, minimal moisture return into the region
and mostly clear skies will continue to cure already drying fuels
and allow RH values to fall into the 20s (and perhaps upper teens)
again during the afternoon.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is likely to promote below normal
temperatures
and elevate chances for hazardous cold across portions of the Rockies, and the
Central and Southern Plains during early week-2. Surface low development may
trigger heavy precipitation over parts of the southeastern lower-48. Over
Alaska, above-normal precipitation is favored over the western Mainland during
week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Rockies,
Central
and Southern Plains, and Missouri and Arkansas, Tue-Fri, Mar 16-19.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi, Ohio
and
Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeast, Wed-Fri, Mar
17-19.

Flooding possible for portions of the Ohio River Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 11 - MONDAY MARCH 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pRDhVd5G_-zJKBegIvjiMKY2cxtdE542OjEPj8VpfIdgRSGcpb8LCk7wGlFfxETc2LPUVuP-$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 16 - MONDAY MARCH 22: There has been good run-to-run
continuity and agreement in the GEFS and ECWMF ensemble means which feature a
mid-level shortwave trough moving over the Central and Southern Plains and a
rapid weakening of anomalous ridging over the eastern CONUS during late
week-1.
As the shortwave trough is forecast to lift out by the beginning of the
outlook
period, differences become more apparent between the GEFS and the ECMWF
ensemble mean mid-level height anomalies. The 0z and 6z GEFS favor the
development of a more amplified tough over the western CONUS with widespread
negative height departures depicted across much of the western two thirds of
the CONUS. The 0z ECMWF is less robust with this development, with weaker
negative height departures that are limited over portions of the Plains and
north-central CONUS during early to mid-week-2. The 0z ECMWF also features
more
amplified mid-level troughing shifting eastward over the east Pacific, which
increases concerns for precipitation related hazards over the West Coast later
in the outlook period.



These differences in the mid-level height anomalies lead to some uncertainty
relative to the strength and extent of anomalous cold air expected over parts
of the western and central U.S.  This morning's reforecast guidance is
reflective of this, as the GEFS reforecast tool depicts a large coverage of
elevated probabilities (>20%) of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile and below freezing, with higher chances (>40%) focused over the
Southern Plains during early week-2. Probabilities for hazardous cold in the
ECMWF reforecast tool are less widespread than the GEFS, however, elevated
chances are also depicted mainly across the Central and Southern Plains during
the early to middle portion of week-2. Thus, a slight risk of much below
normal
temperatures is issued from Mar 16 to 19 for the region, along with adjacent
areas of the Rockies. Temperatures are expected to moderate later in the
period
as the anomalous troughing aloft is anticipated to weaken.



Anomalous mid-level troughing forecast to be in place across the West is
likely
to result in one or more areas of surface low pressure ejecting out of the
Rockies during week-2. There remains much uncertainty regarding the track and
strength of these lows, however, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles point to
above-normal precipitation mainly across the southeastern CONUS associated
with
return flow advecting low-level moisture into the region. While the GEFS
reforecast tool is less supportive of heavy precipitation early in the period,
the raw ECMWF ensembles and ECMWF reforecast tool indicate elevated chances
for
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch. A slight
risk of heavy precipitation is posted for Mar 17 to 19. River flooding in
parts
of the Ohio Valley continues to be a concern, as precipitation is forecast to
be well above-average over the Middle Mississippi Valley and into the western
Ohio Valley during week-1. Although slightly drier conditions are expected
during week-2, any increase in precipitation during week-2 may exacerbate
river
levels and a possible flooding area remains issued in the region.



Farther west, elevated signals for heavy precipitation are evidenced across
portions of central and northern California by the middle portion of week-2.
In
particular, the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts increased chances for
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch during the
middle
of the outlook period. However, given some of the disparities relative to
evolution and strength of mid-level troughing over the eastern Pacific between
the GEFS and the ECMWF ensembles, as well as uncertainty at this lead, no
precipitation hazards are posted but this region will be monitored in upcoming
outlooks.



Over Alaska, both the GEFS and ECMWF favor anomalous troughing over the
northern Mainland to weaken, with positive height departures overspreading
over
the North Pacific to help promote above-normal temperatures throughout much of
the state during week-2. Continued storm activity is anticipated to increase
chances for above-normal precipitation particularly for the western Mainland.
Reforecast tools indicate elevated chances for 3-day precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile, though precipitation amounts are
not expected to exceed hazards criteria and no corresponding hazard is issued.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon March 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 14 - 18 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across most of North America during the 6-10 day period. The ensemble
mean solutions from the GEFS, Canadian, and ECMWF model suites depict an
amplified mean trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies over
the
North Polar region with associated below normal heights extending southward to
northwestern Alaska. Farther to the south, anomalous ridging is forecast over
the North Pacific, leading to anticipated above normal heights across southern
Alaska. Over the CONUS, a southern stream trough is predicted across the
Southwest, resulting in anticipated below normal heights extending from much
of
the western CONUS eastward to the Great Plains and Mississippi Valleys.
Ridging
and above normal heights are expected over parts of the eastern CONUS.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures in much of the CONUS are
associated with mean cyclonic flow and near to below normal mid-level heights,
with the highest (70%) probability over the central Plains. Conversely,
amplified ridging favors enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures
across the Florida Peninsula. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts
of northern and western Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, consistent with the
autoblend outlook tool.

Enhanced flow from the Bering Sea is anticipated across much of Alaska,
favoring above normal precipitation for most of the state, except the Alaska
Panhandle where near to below normal precipitation is favored consistent with
the consolidation forecast tool. Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation
for much of the western CONUS and Northern Plains, and parts of the Southern
Plains, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Mean troughing
centered over the west-central CONUS and the potential for enhanced moisture
advection from the Gulf of Mexico increase probabilities of above normal
precipitation from parts of the central Plains eastward to much of the eastern
CONUS.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 15% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
model agreement on an amplified pattern across much of North America, offset
by
differences among the dynamical precipitation and temperature outlook tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 16 - 22 2021

During the week-2 period, a transitional period is likely as the overall
pattern is forecast to de-amplify and model uncertainty increases. The most
anomalous features predicted by the models across the Northern Hemisphere
include a ridge over the North Pacific, a closed mid-level low north of
Siberia, and troughing over northeastern Canada. The week-2 official 500-hPa
height blend depicts near to below normal heights across the western and
central CONUS. Weak cyclonic flow is forecast near the Great Lakes, and
ridging
is anticipated farther to the south across the Southeast and Gulf Coast. Above
normal heights are anticipated across much of southwestern Alaska. Near to
below normal heights are likely for the remainder of Alaska, associated with
the trough forecast north of Siberia.

Persistent negative height anomalies anticipated over the western and central
CONUS favor enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures from the
Rockies eastward to the Mid-Atlantic. Conversely, ridging enhances odds of
above normal temperatures across the southern Florida Peninsula. Near to above
normal temperatures are favored for northern Mainland Alaska, ahead of a mean
trough forecast over eastern Siberia.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored for much of the western and
central CONUS, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Conversely,
above normal precipitation is likely for parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic, supported by dynamical forecast tools. Above normal
precipitation
is likely for most of northern and central Mainland Alaska, consistent with
most of the dynamical forecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 15% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a predicted transitional pattern across much of the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Late week through weekend heavy rain threat from the
south-central Plains to the Lower Ohio Valley/Mid-South...
...Late week/weekend heavy snow threat over the central Rockies
and High Plains...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A vigorous upper trough with embedded closed low expected to track
rather slowly from California/Nevada through the Southwest and
into the Plains will be a prominent focus of the forecast late
this week into the start of next week. This system will initially
support areas of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow over
southern California and portions of the Great Basin. Then a
favorable system track, deformation, and possibly a couple days of
fairly strong upslope flow suggest increasing potential for a
significant heavy snow event over the central Rockies and High
Plains.  This system has decent confidence into at least the first
part of the weekend. However rapidly increasing model/ensemble
spread for evolution of energy within an upstream Pacific trough
lowers confidence in how much upper troughing (and associated
precipitation coverage/amounts) may ultimately reach the West late
in the period. This issue in turn begins to affect the evolution
of the Southwest system once it reaches the Plains. Farther east a
departing Upper Great Lakes wave will anchor a cold front that
crosses the eastern U.S. (with support from amplified northern
stream upper trough passage) but settles into the central
Plains/Southeast. Interaction of this front with Gulf moisture and
instability--and then reinforcement as the Southwest system tracks
into the Plains--will likely promote a multi-day threat for
locally enhanced rainfall and training convection. Ahead of the
cold front, upper ridging will support much above normal
temperatures for the East into later this week.

The updated forecast for the Southwest into Plains system is
generally a mere refinement incorporating the best consensus of
latest data. Recent GFS/GEFS trends have generally been more in
favor of the slower ECMWF/ECMWF mean but the GEFS mean component
favored the 00Z cycle as the 06Z version returned to a somewhat
faster timing. Model/ensemble spread and recent behavior leads to
rather low confidence for how flow with the approaching Pacific
trough may separate and thus what the resulting shortwave
(possibly upper low) looks like as it heads into the West late in
the period. GFS/GEFS solutions have tended to favor bringing a
deeper and more amplified trough into the West while ECMWF/ECMWF
ensembles have been more inconsistent. It take some time to see
whether it is mere coincidence that the 00Z and new 12Z ECMWF have
ended up with an evolution similar to latest GFS runs. Given the
uncertainty, the favored blend reflects only a portion of the
deepening trend for the incoming Pacific trough--which also leads
to a northward nudge for the Plains system late in the period
(furthered in the 12Z GFS/ECMWF). For an alternative
Pacific/western U.S. evolution, the past couple CMC runs pull off
so much energy over the Pacific that the West stays under an upper
ridge.

Model consensus at the start of the period fairly quickly phased
out 00Z CMC/UKMET input due to developing differences over the
Pacific and elsewhere, leading into a 06Z GFS/00Z GEFS and 00Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean blend that also added a little 12Z/07 ECMWF late
in the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The system tracking through the Southwest and into the Plains
should produce the heaviest snow over the central Rockies and High
Plains toward the end of the week through the weekend, after first
producing areas of locally enhanced to possibly heavy rain/higher
elevation snow over the Great Basin/Southwest late this week.
Typical guidance errors 4-5 days out in time suggest some ongoing
uncertainty for exact track of the system and location of highest
totals but in general the guidance signals are getting stronger
for the potential of a significant central Rockies/High Plains
heavy snow event. Some snow may extend farther northeastward over
the central U.S. from late weekend into early next week depending
on system evolution and track. Confidence for this latter part of
the forecast is much lower though.

Model/ensemble consensus is highlighting an area from the
south-central Plains into and perhaps somewhat south of the Lower
Ohio Valley for highest five-day rainfall totals during the
period. Late this week into the weekend there will be a persistent
flow of Gulf moisture into a front that stalls over the
south-central Plains/Mississippi Valley while the rest of the
front crosses the East. Arrival of height falls aloft from the
Southwest and associated surface system will provide reinforcement
for heavy rainfall potential later in the weekend/early next week.
Meanwhile the Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the threat for
severe thunderstorms over and a little east of the Southern
Plains. Check the latest outlooks for more information as severe
weather details come into clearer focus.

Expect the Northwest to see an increase of rain/mountain snow and
a cooling trend by the weekend into early next week with the
arrival of an upper trough and cold front. The details of timing,
coverage, and amounts are uncertain at this time given guidance
spread for specifics of the upper trough.

The warm sector ahead of the Plains into eastern U.S. front late
this week will contain much above normal temperatures.  The Great
Lakes/Northeast may see plus 15-25F anomalies for daytime highs on
Thursday while a broader northeast-southwest band of plus 20-30F
anomalies for morning lows may exist Thursday-Friday.  Daily
records will likely be more numerous for morning lows (where they
hold as the min through the end of the calendar day) than for
daytime highs.  Meanwhile the system tracking from the Southwest
into the Plains will drop highs to as much as 10-20F below normal
from about the southern half of the West into the central
Rockies/High Plains.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN PANHANDLES REGION...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows a broad longwave trough off
the West Coast with an embedded shortwave approaching the southern
CA coast. This feature will progress eastward through the day and
eject out over the southern/central High Plains this afternoon. As a
result, lee troughing/cyclogenesis is expected and will increase
southwesterly downslope winds off the southern Rockies. The
combination of increasing winds and warm, dry conditions will
support elevated to critical fire weather concerns for the southern
High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Breezy conditions are noted in recent surface observations across
west TX and eastern NM along a diffuse lee trough axis. Winds will
likely strengthen to 15-25 mph along the southern High Plains by mid
afternoon as increasing zonal flow aloft promotes further surface
pressure falls. Diurnal heating/boundary-layer mixing should allow
downward transport of stronger mid-level flow and wind gusts up to
30-40 mph where skies can remain sufficiently clear (though the
spatial extent of cloud cover is somewhat uncertain). Recent
guidance has trended towards slightly higher humidity across
east-central NM, which may be due to higher dewpoints across this
region and immediately upstream. As such, the northern critical risk
area has been reduced in southern extent to mainly the greater
OK/north TX Panhandles region where drier conditions are observed
and confidence in RH near or below 15% is highest.

To the south, 00Z EPZ and TUS soundings show very dry boundary
layers with surface relative humidity near 10%. Recent guidance has
also trended towards stronger mid-level flow over southern NM, which
will support a higher probability of winds over 20 mph. Critical
conditions appear likely for at least a few hours across this
region, but may be conditional on at least partly cloudy (or
clearer) skies to allow for sufficient boundary-layer heating and
mixing to realize the stronger flow aloft.

...Nebraska...
Elevated conditions remain likely behind a surface trough/weak
cold-frontal passage this afternoon across far southern SD and
western NE. Weak cold advection will likely be offset by diurnal
heating and allow RH values to fall into the low 20s. Meanwhile, a
tightening pressure gradient in the vicinity of the deepening low
should allow for winds in the 15-20 mph range. Dry fine fuels across
the region will help support the fire weather potential.

...Southeast and Carolinas...
The latest fuel analyses continue to show a drying trend in 10-hour
and 100-hour fuels across portions of the Southeast and western
Carolinas. Afternoon RH will likely fall into the low 20s (and
perhaps upper teens) once again this afternoon. However, persistent
surface high pressure and weak winds will mitigate most fire weather
concerns.

...Late week/weekend heavy rain threat from the south-central
Plains to the Lower Ohio Valley...
...Late week/weekend heavy snow threat over the central Rockies
and High Plains...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

A robust upper trough with embedded closed low will track slowly
through the Southwest and into the Plains and be a prominent focus
of the forecast late this week into the start of next week. This
system will support areas of enhanced rain and higher elevation
snow over the southern Great Basin/Southwest and a favorable
system track, deformation, and several days of fairly strong
upslope flow suggest increasing potential for a significant heavy
snow event with focus over the central Rockies and High Plains.
This system offers good forecast confidence and continuity into
the weekend.

However, rapidly increasing model/ensemble spread for evolution of
energy within an upstream Pacific trough lowers confidence in how
much upper troughing (and associated precipitation
coverage/amounts) may ultimately reach the West late in the
period. This issue in turn begins to affect the evolution of the
Southwest system once it reaches the Plains. Guidance is all over
the place with ejection and lifting of this main feature over the
central U.S. and continuity is not well maintained days 6-7.
Model/ensemble spread and recent behavior leads to rather low
confidence for how flow with the approaching Pacific trough may
separate and thus what the resulting shortwave (possibly upper
low) looks like as it heads into the West late in the period.
Given the uncertainty, the WPC favored blend reflects only a
portion of the deepening trend for the incoming Pacific trough.
This still leads to a northward lift for the Plains system into
next week. However, the WPC solution leaned increasingly toward
the ECENS mean that does not bring the Plains system as quickly
northward as the 12/18 GFS or the 12 UTC ECMWF. The 00 UTC GFS has
trended a bit slower, but the 00 UTC ECMWF is now a lot slower.

Farther east a departing Upper Great Lakes wave will anchor a cold
front that crosses the eastern U.S. (with support from amplified
northern stream upper trough passage) but settles into the central
Plains/Southeast. Interaction of this front with Gulf moisture and
instability, and then reinforcement as the Southwest system tracks
into the Plains, will likely promote a multi-day threat for
locally enhanced rainfall and training convection.

Overall, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived
from a composite blend of best clustered guidance from the 18 UTC
GEFS mean, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models Friday into Sunday before shifting blend
emphasis increasingly toward the 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean by
early next week.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The system tracking through the Southwest and into the Plains
should produce the heaviest snow over the central Rockies and High
Plains toward the end of the week through the weekend, after first
producing areas of locally enhanced to possibly heavy rain/higher
elevation snow over the Great Basin/Southwest late this week.
Typical guidance errors 4-5 days out in time suggest some ongoing
uncertainty for exact track of the system and location of highest
totals but in general the guidance signals are getting stronger
for the potential of a significant central Rockies/High Plains
heavy snow event. Some snow may extend farther northeastward over
the north-central U.S. and Midwest from late weekend into early
next week depending on system evolution and track. Confidence for
this latter part of the forecast is much lower though.

Model/ensemble consensus is highlighting an area from the
south-central Plains into the Lower Ohio Valley for highest
five-day rainfall totals during the period. Late this week into
the weekend there will be a persistent flow of Gulf moisture into
a front that stalls over the south-central Plains/Mississippi
Valley while the rest of the front crosses the East. Arrival of
height falls aloft from the Southwest and associated surface
system will provide reinforcement for heavy rainfall potential
later in the weekend/early next week. Meanwhile the Storm
Prediction Center is monitoring the threat for severe
thunderstorms over and a little east of the Southern Plains. Check
the latest outlooks for more information as severe weather details
come into clearer focus.

Expect the Northwest to see an increase of rain/mountain snow and
a cooling trend by the weekend into early next week with the
arrival of an upper trough and cold front. The details of timing,
coverage, and amounts are uncertain at this time given guidance
spread for specifics of the upper trough.

0151 AM CST Tue Mar 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A belt of stronger 60-85 mph upper-level flow is forecast to
overspread the southern Rockies/High Plains Wednesday as a broad
upper-level trough, currently situated off the West Coast,
progresses inland. While the residual lee trough from Tuesday may
migrate eastward early in the day, surface pressure falls along the
lee of the Rockies will anchor the trough over the CO/KS border
southward along the TX/NM border. Strengthening winds along this
axis will promote widespread elevated to critical fire weather
conditions over a region with dry fine fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical fire weather conditions remain likely from
southwest NM into eastern NM and the OK/TX Panhandles.
Guidance continues to show high probabilities of widespread
southwesterly winds between 20-30 mph across this region with wind
gusts upwards of 40-45 mph possible amid strong mid-level flow
within a deeply mixed boundary layer. Relative Humidity values
between 10-15% remain likely and may fall as low as the single
digits for portions of eastern NM. Nocturnal RH values in the teens
observed upstream across southern AZ, as well as expected low-level
trajectories emanating from the southern Rockies, give credence to
this forecast. Elevated conditions are expected on the periphery of
the critical risk area, and are possible as far north/northeast as
east-central CO and western KS in the wake of the departing surface
low, though confidence in the RH forecast is somewhat low for this
region. Although larger fuels are only modestly receptive per recent
fuel analyses, several grass fires in recent days across this region
confirm that fine fuels are receptive and will support a wildfire
threat.

...Record high temperatures possible Tuesday across portions of
the Northern and Central Plains into the Upper Mississippi
Valley...

...Much above-average temperatures likely Tuesday and Wednesday
across much of the central and eastern U.S....

...Much needed precipitation on tap along the West Coast from
Oregon into California...

...Heavy snows likely Tuesday night into early Wednesday across
portions of the Central Rockies into portions of the Northern High
Plains...

A front extending from the Northern Plains southwestward to the
Great Basin will slowly move eastward to the Upper Great Lakes
roughly southwestward to the Southern High Plains by Thursday.
The system will produce snow over parts of the Northern
Intermountain Region into parts of the Northern Rockies/Great
Basin on Tuesday.  Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will
start to stream northward over the Plains to the Upper Midwest,
intersecting the boundary and producing rain and thunderstorms
over parts of the Upper Great Lakes into the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday morning.  By Wednesday evening,
the rain will continue over the Upper Great Lakes/Middle
Mississippi Valley.  Furthermore, the associated surface low will
draw cold air southward over the Upper Mississippi Valley as the
rain changes over to snow.  Along the rain/snow line, areas of
freezing rain will develop.  By Thursday morning, rain and snow
will continue over parts of the Upper Midwest.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along the front from the Ohio Valley
southwestward into the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, upper-level energy will move onshore over
the West Coast, advancing to the Upper Midwest by Wednesday
evening.  Coastal rain and higher elevation snow will spread
inland over the West Coast by Tuesday evening.  Overnight Tuesday,
snow will develop over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies and
emerge onto parts of the Northern/Central Plains.  On Wednesday,
more upper-level energy will move onshore over the West Coast that
will allow the mountain snow and lower elevation rain to pick-up
over the West Coast into the Great Basin into the Northern/Central
Rockies.  Additionally, snow and rain will move into parts of the
Southwest late Wednesday afternoon into Thursday.  By Thursday
morning, the rain and snow over the West Coast will start to wane.
 Snowfall totals of 1 to 2 feet are expected over the Sierra
Nevada into the Northwest California coastal mountains.

Moreover, ahead of the front, spring-like temperatures are
expected across much of the central to the eastern U.S. on Tuesday
into Wednesday.  Temperatures across these regions will be much
above average, with highs in the 60s and 70s across many areas.
The greatest departures from average expected over portions of the
Central to Northern Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley,
where high temperatures are expected to be 30 to 40 degrees above
average.  Across these areas, there is the potential for record
high minimum temperatures Tuesday morning and record high maximum
temperatures Tuesday afternoon.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
The strong mid-level anticyclone that has been centered over
southwest Canada for the past week will undergo weakening on Friday,
with mid-level flow becoming more westerly across the Pacific
Northwest. A weak mid-level trough will move through this westerly
flow and into the the northern High Plains, and in its wake a broad
mid-level ridge will begin to build northward from the Southwest.

... Interior Pacific Northwest ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible across much of the
interior portions of the western United States on Friday as strong
diurnal heating combines with a relatively moist airmass
(precipitable water values approaching 1 inch in places). Given the
relatively moist airmass, thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than
dry, with the most likely area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be
across portions of northern California northeast into far southwest
Montana. Here, the combination of slightly lower precipitable water
values, faster mid-level flow, and a drier sub-cloud layer will
yield at least isolated dry thunderstorm potential. Elsewhere, dry,
receptive fuels will pose at least some risk for lightning-induced
fire starts, especially with lightning strikes occurring outside
precipitation cores.

... Eastern Montana ...

Ahead of the aforementioned weak mid-level trough, gusty
southeasterly flow will persist through the morning on Friday,
before the surface-pressure gradient begins to weaken later in the
day as the mid-level trough passes. The result will be the potential
for a couple of hours of elevated fire weather conditions as surface
winds in the 10-20 mph range may overlap relative humidity around 20
percent.

Valid 12Z Fri Jul 02 2021 - 12Z Sun Jul 04 2021

...Excessive heat continues across interior sections of the
Northwest, the Northern Rockies, and the Northern High Plains...

...Locally heavy rainfall likely along a cold front from the
Eastern U.S. to the Deep South and back into the Southern Plains...

...Monsoonal moisture will bring wet weather and daily storm
chances to the Southwest into the weekend...

With an upper level ridge parked over the Western U.S., excessive
heat is expected to continue into the holiday weekend from the
interior Northwest to the Northern High Plains. Well above normal
temperatures will continue through the period, with highs into the
90s and 100s for many locations. A handful of daily records are
possible across parts of the Northern Plains and Northern Great
Basin. The heat has moderated somewhat since earlier in the week,
however conditions remain oppressive just given the prolonged heat
wave and ongoing heat stress with little relief expected
overnight. Widespread excessive heat warnings and heat advisories
remain in effect for much of the region.

Showers and thunderstorms are likely along a cold front as it
moves slowly east and southward through the Eastern U.S. and the
South. The greatest chance for heavy rain on Friday should be
across eastern portions of the Carolinas where WPC has highlighted
a slight risk for excessive rainfall. Elsewhere, moderate to heavy
rainfall and localized flooding are possible on Friday from parts
of the Northeast, into the Deep South and the Southern Plains.
Rain threats continue across the South this weekend as the frontal
boundary settles along the Gulf Coast, with some showers also
continuing across portions of the Northeast as a cyclone deepens
offshore. The frontal passage should bring temperatures to near or
below normal into this weekend, especially for parts of the
northeast and central High Plains where daytime highs on Friday
could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal.

Monsoonal moisture into the Southwest will bring daily and
diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms from Arizona into the
southern Rockies/high Plains. Moderate to locally heavy rainfall
is possible, with concerns for flash flooding, mainly on Friday
across portions of southern Arizona and eastern New Mexico into
western Texas. WPC has highlighted marginal to slight risks for
excessive rains in these regions. Farther north, spotty showers
are likely across parts of the central and northern plains along a
nearly stationary and weak frontal boundary.

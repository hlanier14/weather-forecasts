...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes necessary to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 09/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Sat Sep 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper trough across the Great Lakes will continue to deepen
as it moves eastward into the northeastern US and southeastern
Canada today. To the west, weak ridging is forecast to become
established within the northern branch of split mid-level flow
across the northern and central Rockies. At the same time, a closed
low will meander eastward off Baja California, as a strong trough
approaches the Pacific Northwest. The increase in mid-level ridging
will support warm and dry conditions across the central Rockies.

...Montana and Wyoming...
Beneath the aforementioned ridge, warm temperatures and dry
conditions are expected across much of Montana and Wyoming through
the afternoon. The dry airmass will support surface relative
humidity values below 20% in the lee of the Rockies. Although,
locally higher RH appears likely over western Montana where
temperatures are expected to be cooler. With relatively weak
mid-level flow in place due to the shortwave ridging, surface winds
are not expected to support of widespread fire weather conditions.
However, local enhancement to near 20 mph from terrain and the
development of a weak lee trough may support a few hours of locally
elevated fire weather conditions across portions of Wyoming and
Montana.

...Southern Plains...
Broad but weak high pressure over the southern half of the CONUS
will support warm and dry conditions across much of the southern
Plains this afternoon/evening. Widespread surface humidity values
below 20% are expected across portions of western Oklahoma, Kansas
and into the Texas Panhandle. Here, fuels remain dry and favorable
for fire spread. However, winds generally below 15 mph should limit
the spatial extent of any sustained fire weather conditions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 PM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 28 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021

...Overview...

Guidance agrees upon an amplified upper pattern during the period.
Expect a strong mean ridge to become established over the
east-central U.S. and north/northeast into Canada while a
downstream trough settles over or near the East Coast. Another
mean trough over the West will consist of multiple pieces of
energy and generally become more diffuse with time as a deeper
trough reaches the Northeast Pacific. The most prominent forecast
issues involve details of a potential southwestern U.S. upper low
whose interaction with a Plains front could produce heavy rainfall
over the southern Rockies/High Plains toward the end of the week,
as well as specifics of an upper low likely to be embedded within
the East Coast trough.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Confidence remains in the lower half of the spectrum for details
of an upper low which most operational models suggest will be
within the East Coast trough. Through the 00Z run, ECMWF runs over
the past couple days have trended dramatically
northward/northeastward for the upper low center while the GFS has
adjusted northward from prior runs but from a less extreme
starting point. The earlier ECMWF runs that had an upper low
reaching the Southeast led to some 500mb height anomalies reaching
3-4 standard deviations below normal. Latest CMC runs are showing
the low over New England, which is where the ECMWF mean has
finally started to close off a low. GEFS means are lagging a bit
as it took until the 06Z/12Z runs to provide at least a hint at a
closed low and with a position north/northeast of the ECMWF mean
and operational models. The new 12Z UKMET is now farthest south
(close to Cape Hatteras by early Friday) which reflects the ideas
from some earlier runs of other models. The new 12Z ECMWF actually
ejects the Thursday New England upper low and then digs trailing
trough energy into another farther south upper low whose center
also reaches near Cape Hatteras by Saturday.

There is general agreement that a shortwave moving into the West
through midweek will separate, with an upper low closing off near
the western U.S.-Mexico border and remaining energy continuing
into the Northern Plains and southern Canada. Model/ensemble mean
clustering for the upper low is decent, with typical spread for
exact strength/track but models vary considerably for the details
of the northern energy. The relatively small scale of the latter
keeps predictability low. Another shortwave will likely reach the
Northwest by Friday but it should be fairly weak to start with and
then weaken further.

The updated forecast started with a 00Z/06Z model composite during
the first half of the period. This blend reflected the improving
signal for an upper low to reach at least into New England, along
with refinement of the western trough separation that should occur
by early Thursday. With detail uncertainties rapidly increasing
after early day 5 Thursday the forecast quickly trended to a
nearly half model (06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF/00Z CMC) / half mean (06Z
GEFS/00Z ECens) blend for days 6-7 Friday-Saturday. Ensemble input
tilted more toward the ECens due to its better
depiction/persistence of the New England upper low versus the GEFS.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Through at least midweek the central U.S. will see an expanding
area of showers and thunderstorms as shortwave energy ejects
northward from the southern Rockies/High Plains and low level flow
brings in Gulf moisture that will interact with a front moving
from the West into the Plains. Best potential for some locally
moderate to heavy rainfall will be over parts of the central and
southern Plains. Then expect rainfall to become heavier and more
focused over and near the southern High Plains by Friday-Saturday
with an upper low currently forecast to track over the
Southwest/Four Corners region and low level flow continuing to
bring moisture into a stationary front. There will be periods of
lighter precipitation early-mid period over parts of the
Southwest, eastern Great Basin, and southern Rockies. Over the
Northwest expect light to moderate precipitation on Tuesday with
snow possible over high elevations followed by a brief episode of
rain over the Pacific Northwest around Thursday. Highest totals
with the latter event should be confined to the Olympics. Much of
the East will tend to be dry most of the period but a front
dropping south through the region early in the period could
produce some areas of light rain and the upper low/trough near the
East Coast could produce some scattered rain, most likely over the
Northeast.

The upper ridge settling over east-central North America will
bring the most persistent warmth to the Northern Plains and
Upper/Mid Mississippi Valley through the period. The Northern
Plains in particular may see some plus 20-25F or so anomalies for
daytime highs on Tuesday and morning lows on Wednesday. Otherwise
temperatures will generally be 5-15F above normal. Meanwhile upper
troughing should bring below normal temperatures across much of
the West, with greatest coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies for
highs likely to be from the Northwest and parts of California into
the Great Basin and north-central Rockies Tuesday-Wednesday. By
late week into the weekend the West Coast states and Great Basin
will see a moderating trend while below normal highs focus over
and just west of the southern Rockies. Central/southern parts of
the East will see above normal temperatures Tuesday-Wednesday
ahead of an advancing cold front. Cooler air behind the front will
bring highs down to near normal, and perhaps slightly below normal
along parts of the East Coast.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 PM EDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 28 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 02 2021

...Overview...

Guidance agrees upon an amplified upper pattern during the period.
Expect a strong mean ridge to become established over the
east-central U.S. and north/northeast into Canada while a
downstream trough settles over or near the East Coast. Another
mean trough over the West will consist of multiple pieces of
energy and generally become more diffuse with time as a deeper
trough reaches the Northeast Pacific. The most prominent forecast
issues involve details of a potential southwestern U.S. upper low
whose interaction with a Plains front could produce heavy rainfall
over the southern Rockies/High Plains toward the end of the week,
as well as specifics of an upper low likely to be embedded within
the East Coast trough.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Confidence remains in the lower half of the spectrum for details
of an upper low which most operational models suggest will be
within the East Coast trough. Through the 00Z run, ECMWF runs over
the past couple days have trended dramatically
northward/northeastward for the upper low center while the GFS has
adjusted northward from prior runs but from a less extreme
starting point. The earlier ECMWF runs that had an upper low
reaching the Southeast led to some 500mb height anomalies reaching
3-4 standard deviations below normal. Latest CMC runs are showing
the low over New England, which is where the ECMWF mean has
finally started to close off a low. GEFS means are lagging a bit
as it took until the 06Z/12Z runs to provide at least a hint at a
closed low and with a position north/northeast of the ECMWF mean
and operational models. The new 12Z UKMET is now farthest south
(close to Cape Hatteras by early Friday) which reflects the ideas
from some earlier runs of other models. The new 12Z ECMWF actually
ejects the Thursday New England upper low and then digs trailing
trough energy into another farther south upper low whose center
also reaches near Cape Hatteras by Saturday.

There is general agreement that a shortwave moving into the West
through midweek will separate, with an upper low closing off near
the western U.S.-Mexico border and remaining energy continuing
into the Northern Plains and southern Canada. Model/ensemble mean
clustering for the upper low is decent, with typical spread for
exact strength/track but models vary considerably for the details
of the northern energy. The relatively small scale of the latter
keeps predictability low. Another shortwave will likely reach the
Northwest by Friday but it should be fairly weak to start with and
then weaken further.

The updated forecast started with a 00Z/06Z model composite during
the first half of the period. This blend reflected the improving
signal for an upper low to reach at least into New England, along
with refinement of the western trough separation that should occur
by early Thursday. With detail uncertainties rapidly increasing
after early day 5 Thursday the forecast quickly trended to a
nearly half model (06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF/00Z CMC) / half mean (06Z
GEFS/00Z ECens) blend for days 6-7 Friday-Saturday. Ensemble input
tilted more toward the ECens due to its better
depiction/persistence of the New England upper low versus the GEFS.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Through at least midweek the central U.S. will see an expanding
area of showers and thunderstorms as shortwave energy ejects
northward from the southern Rockies/High Plains and low level flow
brings in Gulf moisture that will interact with a front moving
from the West into the Plains. Best potential for some locally
moderate to heavy rainfall will be over parts of the central and
southern Plains. Then expect rainfall to become heavier and more
focused over and near the southern High Plains by Friday-Saturday
with an upper low currently forecast to track over the
Southwest/Four Corners region and low level flow continuing to
bring moisture into a stationary front. There will be periods of
lighter precipitation early-mid period over parts of the
Southwest, eastern Great Basin, and southern Rockies. Over the
Northwest expect light to moderate precipitation on Tuesday with
snow possible over high elevations followed by a brief episode of
rain over the Pacific Northwest around Thursday. Highest totals
with the latter event should be confined to the Olympics. Much of
the East will tend to be dry most of the period but a front
dropping south through the region early in the period could
produce some areas of light rain and the upper low/trough near the
East Coast could produce some scattered rain, most likely over the
Northeast.

The upper ridge settling over east-central North America will
bring the most persistent warmth to the Northern Plains and
Upper/Mid Mississippi Valley through the period. The Northern
Plains in particular may see some plus 20-25F or so anomalies for
daytime highs on Tuesday and morning lows on Wednesday. Otherwise
temperatures will generally be 5-15F above normal. Meanwhile upper
troughing should bring below normal temperatures across much of
the West, with greatest coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies for
highs likely to be from the Northwest and parts of California into
the Great Basin and north-central Rockies Tuesday-Wednesday. By
late week into the weekend the West Coast states and Great Basin
will see a moderating trend while below normal highs focus over
and just west of the southern Rockies. Central/southern parts of
the East will see above normal temperatures Tuesday-Wednesday
ahead of an advancing cold front. Cooler air behind the front will

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Sat Sep 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA INTO
SOUTH-CENTRAL KANSAS...

Critical fire weather appears likely from northwestern Oklahoma into
south-central Kansas. Above normal temperatures into the 90s F will
support RH of 15-20% in some areas along with the expected strong
winds. The northeastward and southwestward extent of critical
meteorological conditions has some uncertainty. Some guidance does
show similar conditions into northeast Kansas and the Texas
Panhandle. Mid-level clouds are increasing and less receptive fuels
in the Panhandle and marginal RH in northeastern Kansas will keep
concerns elevated. The forecast remains unchanged elsewhere.

..Wendt.. 09/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Sat Sep 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Across the western US, southwesterly mid-level flow will begin to
increase ahead of a strong Pacific trough moving onshore across the
Northwest. To the south, a cutoff low will move eastward, rejoining
broad westerly flow across the Southwest. At the surface, a lee low
will move southeastward across the central Plains, trailing a weak
cold front. Dry and windy conditions are expected ahead of the low
through much of the southern Plains and across the Great Basin where
fuels are dry.

...Southern Plains...
As the previously mentioned lee low develops and moves southeastward
across the Plains early Sunday, increasing surface pressure
gradients will bolster low-level southwesterly flow across portions
of the southern Plains. Aided by the development of a low-level jet,
widespread surface winds of 20-25 mph are expected with higher gusts
possible nearer the low in eastern Kansas. Model soundings show a
dry airmass in place with surface RH below 20% likely across western
Oklahoma and portions of the Texas Panhandle. Increasing cloud cover
and greater surface moisture in eastern Kansas will favor slightly
higher humidity values generally below 30%. With regional fuels near
the 80th percentile of dryness, widespread elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions appear likely. More widespread
critical conditions may develop should the corridor of stronger
winds become better aligned with drier surface conditions across
portions of Oklahoma and Texas.

...Northern Great Basin...
As southwesterly flow from the approaching Pacific trough begins to
spread inland, low-level winds are projected to increase to near
15-20 mph across portions of northern California and northwestern
Nevada. Here, persistent warm and dry conditions with surface RH
below 15%, along with mostly dry fuels will support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat September 25 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southwest and the Northeast through Sunday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains, Great Basin, and Northern
Rockies...

A front extending from the parts of the Northeast to Florida will
remain quasi-stationary until Sunday when upper-level energy aid
invigorates the boundary while moving eastward off the Northeast
Coast. The moisture axis associated with the front will also move
eastward over the Atlantic Sunday evening. Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front through
Sunday morning.  There is an isolated threat of excessive rainfall
with these storms through Sunday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Northeast
through Sunday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create
localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience
rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Meanwhile, upper-level low and moisture over the Southwest will
aid in producing widely scattered showers and thunderstorms over
the area through Monday. Some of the thunderstorms will produce
heavy rain, but this will be isolated.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southwest through Monday morning.  The associated heavy rain will
create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that
experience rapid runoff with heavy rain. However, the excessive
rainfall threat is minimal yet will continue over the region
through Monday.

Furthermore, another front over the Lower Great Lakes roughly
southwestward to the Southern High Plains will move eastward to
the Northeast on Sunday and dissipate. Showers will develop along
and ahead of the boundary over parts of the Lower Great Lakes into
the Central Appalachians/Ohio Valley through Saturday evening.
The rain will move into the Northeast on Sunday and weaken.

Additionally, upper-level ridging over the Northern Rockies and
weak high pressure at the surface over California will create
light wind over the San Joaquin Valley provide stagnant airflow.
Therefore, Air Quality alerts are over parts of California due to
wildfire smoke through Monday. In the meantime, temperatures will
be 10 to 20 degrees above average over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains, Great Basin, and Northern Rockies.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
252 AM EDT Sun Sep 26 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Sep 29 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 03 2021

...Overview...

An amplified upper pattern is expected especially early in the
medium range period, as ridging in the east-central U.S. separates
a likely closed low over the Northeast and mean troughing over the
West. Southern stream troughing/energy over the Four Corners
states and moist inflow will lead to heavy rainfall potential over
southern portions of the Rockies and Plains toward the end of the
week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance from the 12/18Z cycle begins the medium range
period Wednesday fairly well clustered with the pattern described
above, and has trended more agreeable than earlier model cycles
with the formation and placement of a closed low in the East
around Wednesday-Thursday. Most deterministic guidance produces
the closed low over the Northeast U.S., continuing the general
northward trend. The main outlier by early Friday was the 12Z
UKMET, which splits the energy and closes off the low centered
around Cape Hatteras, while other recent guidance has trended away
from the placement that far south. On Friday and beyond, quite a
bit of model variability arises quickly with the upper/low trough
feature. Trough energy moving southward spins southwest in the 12Z
ECMWF, creating a farther south (around Cape Hatteras) upper low
by the weekend, but spins southeastward in the GFS runs while
keeping the core of the upper low to the north. Meanwhile the 12Z
CMC maintains most of its energy within the low rather than
splitting it off. Hurricane Sam may also be a factor to consider
as it moves northward through the Atlantic late in the week.
Overall confidence is low with the upper low placement and
evolution by the weekend. At this point the WPC forecast tried to
take a middle ground approach, with upper low placement around
Downeast Maine on day 6/Saturday as a compromise center point.
Ensemble mean guidance was only somewhat helpful as the
differences in the upper low position in the ensemble members led
to more of an open trough than individual models. Overall
preferred the 12Z ECens mean compared to the GEFS means as the
former maintained a closed low at least through Friday.

Meanwhile in the West, an upper trough with shortwaves moving
through for midweek has general agreement along the guidance.
Models show shortwave energy splitting with some moving into the
north-central U.S./south-central Canada, and some forming a
southern stream trough or potential closed low centered in the
Desert Southwest around Thursday. Some differences in the exact
track and magnitude of both these features remain. But guidance
all has similar ideas in lifting the Southwest energy
northeastward through the Four Corners states for the end of the
week that a model blend worked well to depict the feature.

The WPC forecast began with a 12/18Z deterministic model composite
blend, eliminating the 12Z UKMET by Friday, and incorporating the
GEFS and especially the EC mean guidance for the latter part of
the period and increasing the weight of the means by the weekend
to minimize individual model differences.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Central parts of the Plains will see showers and thunderstorms
around midweek as moisture pools ahead of a shortwave and frontal
boundary, and some rain could spread to the Upper Midwest on
Thursday and Friday. But the greater chance for multi-day
accumulations of multiple inches of rain will be across the
southern High Plains beginning Thursday and lasting into the
weekend, as the upper low in the Southwest provides moist inflow
from both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico. The Pacific
Northwest can expect precipitation on Wednesday into Thursday,
with the highest totals in the Olympics and Cascades, and some
snow possible at the highest elevations. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms are expected across southern Florida as a couple of
fronts move across, while areas of light rain are possible across
the Eastern Seaboard due to the upper low/trough, mostly likely
over the Northeast.

Warmer than average conditions are forecast underneath the upper
ridge from the Dakotas into the Upper Midwest through the period.
Temperatures 10-20F above average will mean highs in the 70s and
80s there. Meanwhile, much of the West should see below normal
temperatures given the upper trough. The most anomalous
temperatures of 10-20F below normal are forecast in the Great
Basin on Wednesday, while shifting east and slightly moderating as
the week progresses. Cool high temperatures could linger in the
Four Corners states into the weekend. Near to slightly below
average highs are forecast for the East.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow is expected across the western and central US
as a strong shortwave trough moves onshore across portions of the
Pacific Northwest. At the same time, a weak upper low across the
Southwest will meander northward and re-enter the stronger mid-level
westerlies near the Four Corners. At the surface, a lee low will
move southeastward, supporting dry and windy conditions across the
southern Plains, while shower and thunderstorm chances increase
across the Southwest.

...Southern Plains...
Ahead of the area of low pressure moving southeastward across the
Great Plains, hot, dry and gusty southwesterly winds are expected
across portions of the Texas Panhandle, western Oklahoma and
southern Kansas. Surface temperatures near 90F (10-15 deg above
normal) will likely support widespread surface RH of 10-20% across
portions of Texas and Oklahoma through peak heating. A robust
morning low-level jet should linger through the day, enhancing
low-level winds to 20-25 mph in the afternoon.

Slightly stronger flow and somewhat higher gusts may persist farther
northeast near the low and trailing surface trough across portions
of eastern Kansas. Here, surface RH is expected to be higher due to
increasing low-level moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico. By
mid afternoon, surface RH of 20-25% and winds of 20-30 mph will
likely develop over mostly dry fuels.

Persistent hot and dry conditions combined with little recent
rainfall suggest fuels remain mostly supportive of fire spread
across the southern Plains. However, some guidance depicts a greater
increase in mid and high cloud cover early in the forecast period
across portions of Texas and western Oklahoma. This casts some
uncertainty on diurnal RH minimums and curing of fine fuels. Despite
these concerns, model agreement is strong on the development of
gusty winds across much of the southern Plains supportive of
widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...Northern Great Basin...
On the southern fringes of the approaching upper trough, stronger
mid-level flow is forecast to cross the Sierra and move into
portions of the northern Great Basin. Downslope winds of 15-20 mph
are expected to overlap warm and dry surface conditions with RH of
10-15%. Local fuels remain receptive to fire spread suggesting
elevated fire weather conditions are likely from portions of
northern California, into northwestern Nevada and southern Oregon.

...Portions of the northern/central Rockies...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the Pacific Northwest trough,
dry downslope flow should gradually develop across much of the
Intermountain west. Synoptic forcing remains rather broad,
suggesting portions of eastern Idaho, central Montana and southern
Wyoming, may experience stronger wind gusts and accompanying dry
fuels/surface conditions supporting local fire weather potential.
Terrain enhancement will likely support surface winds of 15-20 mph
with RH near 15-20%. In areas of dry fuels, locally elevated to
critical fire weather conditions can be expected for a few hours in
the afternoon and evening.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
A strong Pacific trough is forecast to continue inland across the
West Coast early Monday, bringing an increase in southwesterly flow
to much of the Great Basin and western US. At the surface, a dry
cold front across Oregon will move south, bringing an increase in
low-level winds and the potential for critical fire weather
conditions across portions of the Sierra and Great Basin.

...Northern Great Basin...
As the strong Pacific trough continues to move eastward through the
day, a 70-80 kt mid-level jet streak will begin to overspread
northern California and the Great Basin by midday. The increase in
strong southwesterly flow will support deep mixing and bolster
low-level winds to 20-30 mph through the afternoon. Dry downslope
trajectories off the High Sierra and a persistent warm and dry
airmass across much of the region will favor low humidity values of
10-15% from northern California, through northern Nevada and into
portions of southern Oregon. Fuels remain receptive to spread
suggesting widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions
are likely.

A cold front will approach later in the afternoon and evening as the
trough ejects northeastward. Little precipitation is expected along
the front, but locally gusty winds and a change in direction
associated with the frontal passage may increase potential for
short-term fire weather concerns later in the forecast period. The
fire weather threat should gradually diminish behind the front after
dark, as a cooler and more moist airmass moves in.

Locally elevated fire weather conditions may also briefly develop
ahead of the cold front across portions of eastern Idaho and
southwestern Montana. Here, strong wind gusts of 20-25 mph appear
likely through the afternoon. However, confidence in widespread low
humidity is lacking. Nonetheless, fuels mostly support fire spread
suggesting some fire-weather threat before frontal passage in the
late afternoon/evening.

...Additional rounds of showers and thunderstorms may produce
isolated instances of flash flooding across portions of Maine and
the Southwest...

...Unsettled weather found across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Great Basin...

...Dry and unseasonably warm throughout the Great Plains and
Midwest...

A tranquil end of the weekend and start of a new week is on the
way for the majority of nation, with precipiation chances confined
to only a few sections of the country. Starting in the east, one
more day of heavy rain chances will be found across Maine as a low
pressure system passes by to the east. The primary concern with
these showers and thunderstorms will be the potential for
downpours and isolated flash flooding. Additional scattered
showers are possible across New England on Monday as the next cold
front enters the region. Meanwhile, an upper-level low lifting
into the Desert Southwest will be responsible for thunderstorm
chances over the next couple of days across Arizona, New Mexico,
and the Four Corners region. A few severe thunderstorms are not
out of the question today across southern Arizona and southwestern
New Mexico, with isolated flash flood concerns found throughout
much of the Southwest and Four Corners through Tuesday morning.

Elsewhere, a potent storm system and associated cold front are
forecast to deliver damp and dreary weather to the Pacific
Northwest today and eventually make it into the northern Great
Basin by Monday evening. Overall rainfall amounts of 1 to 2 inches
can be expected across western Oregon and Washington, with higher
amounts found in the Olympic and Cascade mountains. Gusty winds
ahead of the cold front could produce elevated to critical fire
weather across the northern and central Great Basin today and
Monday. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches have been
issued across parts of southern Oregon, northwest Nevada and the
northern/central Sierra Nevada.

Autumn is taking an early vacation throughout the central U.S.
over the next couple of days as high temperatures soar well above
average. Widespread highs into the upper 80s and low 90s will be
found throughout the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest under a
building upper-level ridge. This equates to around 10 to 20
degrees above average. Combined with the warm temperatures, low
relative humidity and gusty winds could lead to critical fire
weather across part of the central and southern Plains. In order
to highlight the concern, Red Flag Warnings have been issued for
parts of south-central Kansas and north-central Oklahoma.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CST Tue Jan 18 2022

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The potential for robust fire weather concerns appears low across
the central and southern High Plains where fuels are currently the
driest. Fire weather threats will be mitigated largely due to the
passage of a southward-surging cold front through the morning hours
Wednesday. While breezy northerly winds are likely, falling
temperatures behind the front will keep RH values above elevated
thresholds. Further south across southwest TX, westerly winds ahead
of the cold front may support enough downslope warming/drying for RH
reductions into the 20-30% range. Dry pockets may overlap with winds
near 15 mph and support a couple hours of patchy elevated
conditions. However, the duration and coverage of such conditions
remains uncertain and will be determined by the southward
progression of the cold front.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EST Tue Jan 18 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 18 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 20 2022

...Heavy snow for parts of the Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern High Plains on Tuesday...

...There is a Risk of rain/freezing rain over parts of the
Southern Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley on Wednesday...

Low pressure over the Northern Plains will move eastward across
the Great Lakes overnight Tuesday and into Ontario, Canada, by
Wednesday morning, then into the Canadian Maritimes by Thursday.
By Thursday, the associated front will move eastward to just off
the Northeast Coast and across the Mid-Atlantic to the Central
Gulf Coast. The system will produce heavy snow across parts of
Upper Mississippi Valley, near Lake Superior and Michigan s Upper
Peninsula, on Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Light snow will move
into the Lower Great Lakes overnight Tuesday and into Northern New
England on Wednesday into Thursday morning. In the wake of the
system, lake effect snow will develop downwind from the Great
Lakes.

Meanwhile, warm air ahead of the boundary will produce
temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts of the
Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday. Additionally, the warm
temperatures, gusty wind, and dry fuels have led to an area of
Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the Southern High
Plains.

In the meantime, the western portion of the front will produce
light snow over parts of the Northern Rockies into the Northern
Plains on Tuesday. In addition, overnight Tuesday, moisture from
the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to pool along the boundary
over the eastern portion of the front, developing rain over parts
of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley. However, light snow will develop over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley starting late Wednesday afternoon. Along the
rain/snow line, areas of light rain/freezing rain will develop
over parts of the Southern Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley on Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning.
Overnight Wednesday, the snow will expand into parts of the Ohio
Valley into parts of the Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic.
Furthermore, the rain over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee
Valleys moves into parts of the Southern Appalachians and parts of
the Mid-Atlantic by Thursday morning.

Furthermore, weak onshore flow will produce light rain over parts
of the Pacific Northwest and some snow at the higher elevations
into late Tuesday night. Energy moving across the Southwest into
the Southern Plains will aid in producing light snow over parts of
the Central Rockies on Tuesday and Wednesday, with the light snow
moving into parts of the Southern Rockies on Wednesday evening
into Thursday morning.

Lastly, in the wake of the winter storm to impact the Mid-Atlantic
to the Northeast, light snow will linger over parts of the Central
Appalachians into parts of the Northeast that will end by Tuesday
evening.

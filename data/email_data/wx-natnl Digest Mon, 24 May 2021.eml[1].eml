Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1020 AM CDT Sun May 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on morning observations and recent MRMS rainfall estimates.
Morning water-vapor imagery shows an embedded impulse tracking
across the Southwest with a trailing region of subsidence over
southern AZ. This feature should move into southwest/central NM
(where RH values in the low teens are noted) by the afternoon hours.
Elevated, to briefly critical, conditions remain likely - especially
across central NM where the best overlap of dry conditions and
stronger mid-level flow is expected. See the previous discussion
below for additional details.

..Moore.. 05/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Sun May 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will move northeastward today and
eventually emerge onto the central and northern Plains late in the
afternoon. The strongest lee troughing will be ahead of the main
synoptic wave in the northern Plains, though a weaker surface trough
will extend into the Trans-Pecos. Fire weather concerns are expected
to be maximized in parts of southwestern and central New Mexico
where a belt of stronger mid-level flow will exist during the
afternoon. Downward momentum transfer and a surface trough to the
east will promote 15-20 mph winds within a dry airmass (5-15% RH)
bringing elevated fire weather during the afternoon. Locally
critical conditions are possible in central New Mexico. Strong winds
and dry conditions will extend into northeast New Mexico and
southeast Colorado. However, these areas have less receptive fuels
and also observed rainfall on Saturday.

Locally elevated conditions are possible in portions of southeastern
Utah. These conditions are likely to be tied more to terrain-favored
locations given weaker flow aloft and a less favorable surface
pattern than Saturday. Furthermore, precipitation from Saturday will
have impacted some of the dry fuels there.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1239 PM EDT Sun May 23 2021

Valid 12Z Wed May 26 2021 - 12Z Sun May 30 2021

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic
Wednesday...

17Z Update:  The latest deterministic guidance is in very good
agreement through the first half of the forecast period.  The 00Z
CMC remains faster than the consensus with the shortwave and
surface low crossing the north-central U.S. through the end of the
week.  By next weekend, more noteworthy timing differences are
evident with a faster GFS solution with the trough near the East
Coast, and the ECMWF farther back across the Ohio Valley region,
so a blend of those two models along with their respective
ensemble means should provide a decent compromise.  The previous
forecast discussion is appended below. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper pattern will feature quasi-zonal flow with relative lower
amplitude waves in a trough/ridge orientation over the West/East,
respectively. This will favor well above normal temperatures in
parts of the East/Southeast and cooler than normal temperatures
for parts of the High Plains to the Upper Midwest. In between,
rainfall will be focused around a wavy frontal boundary.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Aside from the 12Z Canadian, the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET offered
reasonable clustering near their ensemble means with the first
half of the forecast. In question has been upstream flow south of
Alaska into the Pacific Northwest, but this uncertainty has
narrowed in recent runs. By next weekend, ensemble spread
increased (as expected) but was within typical limits. The
GFS/GEFS were generally quicker than the ECMWF/ECMWF ensembles and
Canadian ensembles in the West but were not unreasonable given the
flow. However, favored the slower ECMWF/ECMWF and Canadian
ensembles by about 3:1 to the GEFS with a tendency for some
individual systems to lag behind despite the overall progressive
pattern.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period will likely be over
the central Plains to the Midwest and Great Lakes along a wavy
frontal boundary. Parts of the northern Rockies and High Plains
will see some light rain and high mountain snow with the Wednesday
system. As low pressure moves through the Central Plains on
Thursday, an area of organized and moderate to heavy rain could
shift through the northern/central Plains into the Midwest. The
cold front may touch off light to modest showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms in the warm air mass or just north of the frontal
zone. Some rainfall amounts have the potential to be locally heavy
in some convectively enhanced areas (generally over the
southern/central Plains). Areas in the East may see some light
showers as the front ebbs and flows.

Temperatures will be cool in the High Plains to Upper Midwest
Wed-Fri, warm/hot in the East (Wed) and Southeast (Wed-Fri), and
within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest anomalies of
about 5 to 15 degrees below normal will be centered from eastern
Montana to northern Minnesota Wed-Thu. In the East temperatures
may climb to 10-20F above normal which will bring 80s/90s into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over the Southeast on
Wednesday. Record highs are likely in some areas along the I-95
corridor (Georgia to New Jersey). Heat indices may be kept in
check by dew points in the 50s/60s through the week. Temperatures
will cool back toward more typical late May values for Fri-Sun
(Memorial Day weekend) but along with increased rain chances.

...Late-season snow lingering across the northern Rockies today
with well above normal temperatures across the northern Plains
into the Great Lakes through Tuesday...

...Scattered Thunderstorms through the Plains will produce locally
heavy rains, isolated Flash Flooding and an Enhanced Risk of
Severe Weather...

...Hot weather across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic today
(Sunday) will get a short break on Monday before building back on
Tuesday...

The mid to upper level highly amplified pattern will be starting
to break down as the deep closed low across the Great Basin will
lift north-northeast into south-central Canada.  As such,
anomalously cold air across the Northern Rockies will support
another round of late season snows from Western Montana into
Northwest Wyoming.  A strong surface cyclone will roll out of
Wyoming today pulling very warm (10-15 degrees above normal) and
moist air across the northern Plains and will support an Enhanced
Risk of severe weather per Storm Prediction Center with large hail
and strong winds expected across across much of the northern High
Plains, with best tornado prospects across northeast Colorado to
Western South Dakota.  This line of strong storms may produce a
quick burst of heavy rain that may lead to widely scattered
flooding concerns as the Weather Prediction Center highlights the
similar area with a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall.   Slower
moving cells overnight Sunday into Monday also pose a Marginal
Risk of Excessive Rainfall across southeast Minnesota into much of
Wisconsin; while grounds have been in drought, the quick heavy
nature is not likely to soak into the ground with much running off
leading to highly localized flooding concerns especially in urban
settings.

Monday into Tuesday, the storm will migrate into south-central
Canada but the warm front will surge north across the Great Lakes
and lead to high temperatures to surge into the high 80s and
possible low 90s by Tuesday over the central Great Lakes, but even
high 70s across far northern MN and the U.P. of Michigan too.  The
strong ridge over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the South will
support anomalously high temperatures too, with some highs into
the high 90s by Tuesday across AL, GA and SC.  Across the
Northeast, a cold front will drop through later today and bring a
break to the Northeast and coastal Mid-Atlantic with highs below
average on Monday.  In the crossroads between the Great
Lakes/Northeast, there is a threat for repeat overnight
thunderstorms that may bring excessive rainfall and potential for
scattered flash flooding concerns across the Allegheny Plateau and
Allegheny Mountains, where complex/rolling terrain channels water
toward flooding concerns faster.  Similar stormy conditions will
expand into southern Mid-Atlantic and North Carolina Monday into
Tuesday.

The deep tropical moisture feed/atmospheric river along the
southwest portion of the strong Eastern U.S. Ridge remains
directed at the central Texas coast, but it appears to be reducing
toward Tuesday and later in the week.  Still, threat of scattered
thunderstorms across saturated grounds, still poses a Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall across the Central Texas Coast today, but a
Marginal Risk remains for Monday.  If there is one benefit of the
deeper moisture; is the cloud cover reducing overall temperatures
to near or slightly below normal across much of the Southern
Plains.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 PM CDT Sun May 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Localized elevated conditions remain likely for southwest NM, but
recent guidance continues to show low potential for a more robust,
widespread fire weather concern. See the discussion below for
additional details.

..Moore.. 05/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Sun May 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough over the central/northern Plains will continue
to lift northeastward during the day. Weaker, zonal flow will exist
over much of the Southwestern U.S. A weak lee trough may induce
locally elevated conditions in parts of New Mexico during the
afternoon, but conditions should be spatially limited. Dry
conditions will remain in the remainder of the Southwest and
southern Great Basin. Flow at the surface and aloft will be too weak
for fire weather concerns in these regions.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 23 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

over the weekend, favoring troughing over California and in the
East, but with near to above normal height CONUS-wide. Rainfall
will be focused around a wavy frontal boundary from the central
Plains to the East Coast.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance cycle, the latest deterministic
models showed reasonable clustering for the Thu-Sat period as low
pressure along the front moves from the Plains to the Ohio Valley
to the Mid-Atlantic. By then, uncertainty increases with a
southern stream shortwave through Texas/lower MS Valley as well as
the unfolding western trough and possible low pressure development
just off the East Coast. With lackluster continuity in the models,
trended toward a majority ensemble blend of the three systems
(GEFS/Canadian/European) with a small weighting of the
GFS/ECMWF/Canadian deterministic runs to offer just a bit of
detail where appropriate. 00Z/01Z National Blend of Models
informed most of the sensible weather grids with additional
weighting to the ECMWF ensemble mean for temperatures/PoPs but a
multi-model/ensemble blend for the QPFs.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall during the period will likely be over
the central Plains to the Corn Belt eastward to the central
Appalachians along a wavy frontal boundary. As low pressure moves
through the Central Plains on Thursday, an area of organized and
moderate to heavy rain could shift through the Mississippi Valley
into the Ohio Valley. Some rainfall amounts have the potential to
be locally heavy in some convectively-enhanced areas. Areas in the
East may see some light/modest showers as the front ebbs and flows
in the Mid-Atlantic.

For Thu-Fri, temperatures will be cool in the northern Plains to
Upper Midwest, warm in the Southeast, and within several degrees
of normal in between. For the Memorial Day weekend forecast,
expect near to slightly below normal temperatures for many
northern areas but near to slightly above normal temperatures for
many southern areas. The Pacific Northwest may see temperatures
more than 10 degrees above normal by next Monday. Rainfall may be
scattered in many areas east of the Rockies and focused on one or
two days over the central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic (where little
rain has fallen this month).

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough will continue to lift northeast into the
northern Plains and southern Canada. Upper-level winds will be much
weaker over areas with dry fuels today. Locally elevated fire
weather conditions do appear possible in parts of New Mexico. A weak
shortwave trough may help to boost surface winds in central and
northeastern portions of the state. Fuels in northeastern New Mexico
are not receptive and conditions appear too brief in
central/southern areas.

Dry conditions will remain across the Florida Peninsula, given how
dry fuels are, even light winds may pose a elevated threat for
wildfire spread. However, the overall synoptic pattern suggests
areas of 10-15 mph winds will be localized and brief.

There is some potential for lightning in portions of Oregon. Fuel
conditions are generally marginal and so the overall risk for
lightning ignitions appears low at this time.

0142 AM CDT Mon May 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Modest mid-level winds will overspread the western/southern Great
Basin during the afternoon on Tuesday. A surface trough will deepen
in southern Nevada into western Utah. A very dry airmass is expected
to be in place during the afternoon with 5-15% RH probable. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected with some higher gusts given very deep
boundary layer mixing. Elevated to near critical conditions may
occur in southern Nevada into adjacent southwest Utah and northwest
Arizona. Given only 20-25 mph flow in the lowest 1-3 km and a weak
surface trough, any critical conditions are expected to be
terrain-driven or brief.

...Late-season snow across the northern Rockies slowly winding
down today but resuming Tuesday night...

...Scattered thunderstorms through the Plains could produce
locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding with possible severe
weather...

Another round of mountain snow is currently in progress across the
northern Rockies as a low pressure system intensifies over the
northern Plains and lifts quickly northward into the Canadian
prairies today.  Strong to severe thunderstorms will accompany the
sharp trailing cold front across the northern and central Plains
early this morning.  But as the main energy of the low pressure
system lifts into Canada, there is a tendency for the
thunderstorms to become weaker during the next couple of days.
However, the stream of tropical moisture from the Gulf remains
open for the next couple of days.  Scattered thunderstorms could
still produce locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding with
possible severe weather over parts of the central and southern
Plains into Wednesday morning.

On the cold side of the system, more mountain snow is falling
today over the northern Rockies.
Monday into Tuesday, the storm will migrate into south-central
Canada but the warm front will surge north across the Great Lakes
and lead to high temperatures to surge into the high 80s and
possible low 90s by Tuesday over the central Great Lakes, but even
high 70s across far northern MN and the U.P. of Michigan too.  The
strong ridge over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the South will
support anomalously high temperatures too, with some highs into
the high 90s by Tuesday across AL, GA and SC.  Across the
Northeast, a cold front will drop through later today and bring a
break to the Northeast and coastal Mid-Atlantic with highs below
average on Monday.  In the crossroads between the Great
Lakes/Northeast, there is a threat for repeat overnight
thunderstorms that may bring excessive rainfall and potential for
scattered flash flooding concerns across the Allegheny Plateau and
Allegheny Mountains, where complex/rolling terrain channels water
toward flooding concerns faster.  Similar stormy conditions will
expand into southern Mid-Atlantic and North Carolina Monday into
Tuesday.

The deep tropical moisture feed/atmospheric river along the
southwest portion of the strong Eastern U.S. Ridge remains
directed at the central Texas coast, but it appears to be reducing
toward Tuesday and later in the week.  Still, threat of scattered
thunderstorms across saturated grounds, still poses a Slight Risk
of Excessive Rainfall across the Central Texas Coast today, but a
Marginal Risk remains for Monday.  If there is one benefit of the
deeper moisture; is the cloud cover reducing overall temperatures
to near or slightly below normal across much of the Southern
Plains.

still produce locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding with
possible severe weather over parts of the central and southern
Plains into Wednesday morning.  The plentiful cloud cover will
keep temperatures near or slightly below normal across much of the
Southern Plains.

On the cold side of the system, the mountain snow over the
northern Rockies should slowly wind down later today as the storm
will begin to move eastward tonight across south-central Canada
and intensify further.  This will bring gusty winds across the
northern Plains into tonight.  Over the Great Lakes, a warm front
will push warm and humid air into the region.  Meanwhile, cooler
air from New England will push southward through the Mid-Atlantic
states today behind a back-door cold front.  Some thunderstorms
could develop across the Mid-Atlantic today as a low pressure wave
moves along the frontal boundary.  By Tuesday night, warm air will
try to sneak back in across New England behind a warm front.

Meanwhile, moisture from the next system in the Pacific is
expected to push into the Pacific Northwest today.  This system
could help organize another round of wet snow across the northern
Rockies by late Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

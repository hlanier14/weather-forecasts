Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1116 AM CDT Fri May 27 2022

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEVADA AND SOUTHWEST
UTAH...

No changes to the previous forecast.

..Wendt.. 05/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Fri May 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, moderate southwesterly flow is forecast to
overspread much of the Great Basin and Southwestern US through
Friday and into early Saturday. A subtle shortwave trough within the
flow is forecast to move across the southern Great Basin, reaching
the central Rockies late this evening. A weak surface cold front
associated with the wave will move east, enhancing low-level winds
along and to its south. This stronger surface flow, along with warm
and dry surface conditions, will support widespread elevated and
critical fire weather conditions across much of the Southwest.

...Southern Great Basin, Southwest, and southern High Plains...
Beneath the strengthening southwesterly flow aloft, warm and dry
conditions are forecast across much of the Desert Southwest and
southern High Plains. 15-20 mph surface winds are expected to
overlap with afternoon humidity values below 15%, supporting
widespread elevated to locally critical conditions across portions
of the southern High Plains, much of NM and into the Four Corners.
Farther to the north and west, stronger mid-level flow beneath the
passing shortwave will likely enhance surface winds to 20-25 mph
south of the weak cold front across southern NV and southwestern UT.
Here, the stronger surface winds and similar/15% surface humidity
will support sustained critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the southern Great Basin where fuels are quite dry.

300 PM EDT May 27 2022

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, areas of mid-level low pressure are forecast alo=
ng
the West Coast of the Contiguous U.S. (CONUS), and over the eastern CONUS.
These features increase the chances for high winds over parts of the wester=
n
CONUS and High Plains, and also favor unseasonably cool temperatures over
parts
of the Midwest and eastern CONUS. The prevailing mid-level flow pattern fav=
ors
increased tropical moisture over Florida, with increasing signals for tropi=
cal
cyclone development emerging over the Gulf of Mexico. By the middle of the
period, the pattern is forecast to become less amplified, although there ar=
e
indications of increased mid-level high pressure developing over the
south-central CONUS, with excessive heat concerns emerging across parts of =
the
Southern Plains. Flooding risks remain elevated across the Red River of the
North and northern Minnesota.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Florida Peninsula,
Sat-Tue, Jun 4-7.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the western CONUS and the Central
and
Southern High Plains, Sat-Sun, Jun 4-5.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Southern Plains, Sat-Fri,
Jun
4-10.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North and northern
Minnesota.

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 04 - FRIDAY JUNE 10: At the beginning of week-2, mid-leve=
l
troughing is predicted across the eastern CONUS. The 0z and 6z GEFS are mor=
e
amplified with this trough compared to the 0z ECMWF ensemble, in addition t=
o
depicting a more pronounced negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) patte=
rn
at the higher latitudes. While both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools dep=
ict
some areas of the East having at least a 40 percent chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th climatological percentile, actual
temperatures are not expected to reach hazards criteria heading into the ea=
rly
part of June. The reforecast tools, particularly the GEFS, indicate elevate=
d
chances (20-40 percent) for temperatures falling below 40 deg F across part=
s
of
the northern Great Lakes and interior Northeast. However, uncalibrated
deterministic guidance from the 0z and 6z GFS, and the 0z ECMWF, along with
their ensemble means, generally keep overnight temperatures above 40 deg F
over
the aforementioned areas. Given this relatively warmer uncalibrated guidanc=
e,
and lack of agreement in terms of the magnitude of the trough between the
ECMWF
and GEFS, a much below normal temperature hazard is not posted in today=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
outlook. While not necessarily hazardous, a period of unseasonably cool
weather
is possible across the eastern CONUS, which will be a big change from the v=
ery
warm temperatures forecast in week-1 over these areas.



The aforementioned troughing over the East is forecast to promote an increa=
se
in tropical moisture flow across the southeastern CONUS. Both the GEFS and
ECMWF favor the heaviest rainfall over south Florida (week-2 total rainfall
greater than 3 inches). The weaker amplitude of troughing in the East depic=
ted
in the ECMWF results in a less progressive cold front, favoring week-2 tota=
l
rainfall of 1.5-3 inches throughout the remainder of the Florida Peninsula,
while the GEFS is drier across the northern half of the peninsula. Both the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance of 3-=
day
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 1 inc=
h
through the middle of the period over parts of Florida, with the ECMWF
extending the elevated probabilities further north than the GEFS. Therefore=
, a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted across much of the Florid=
a
Peninsula from Jun 4-7. The last few runs of the deterministic GFS and ECMW=
F,
along with their ensemble members, indicate potential for tropical cyclone
development, although there is still large uncertainty in terms of exact
location and timing. The GFS suite favors a quicker system, being picked up=
 by
the trough over the eastern CONUS, while the ECMWF solutions are generally
slower and more focused over the Gulf of Mexico.



The mid-level trough located near the West Coast of the CONUS supports
elevated
chances for high winds along parts of the western CONUS and the Central and
Southern High Plains. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at least a 20 perce=
nt
chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20-mph across these
areas, thus a slight risk of high winds is posted for Jun 4-5. Increased wi=
nd
speeds over regions with severe and, in some cases, exceptional drought
conditions may increase the potential for wildfires. The forecast weakening=
 of
the trough favors decreasing probabilities for high winds by the middle of =
the
period.



Downstream of this mid-level troughing, ridging is predicted to develop,
resulting in positive temperature anomalies increasing over the south-centr=
al
CONUS. The uncalibrated GEFS depicts temperatures roughly 10 deg F warmer
(near
or exceeding 100 deg F) than the ECMWF ensemble (closer to 90 deg F) over
parts
of eastern Texas resulting in some increased uncertainty compared to
yesterday.
The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20 percent chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 deg F (100 deg F across
southwestern Texas) during all of week-2, with the the ECMWF reforecast too=
l
not indicating these elevated probabilities until day-10 (Jun 6). While the=
re
are some differences between the GEFS and ECMWF, especially early in the
period, the unclibrated ECMWF/GEFS composite heat probabilistic tool depict=
s
parts of Texas having increased potential (20-40 percent chance) for heat
indices reaching 105-110 deg F during week-2, supporting the slight risk fo=
r
excessive heat for the entire period. The dry soils across most of Texas al=
so
favor higher temperatures. The GEFS heat tool expands some of these elevate=
d
chances of excessive heat eastward into the Lower Mississippi Valley, but t=
he
hazard is not extended at this time due to the relatively cooler ECMWF
guidance
and lower magnitude negative soil moisture anomalies.



River flooding is ongoing across areas along the Red River of the North and
Northern Minnesota. Heavy rain is forecast over these areas during the week=
-1
period, which favors the flooding risks to persist into week-2.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FOUR CORNERS INTO THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

The primary change to the outlook was to expand the Critical area
into southeast Colorado and parts of the western combined
Panhandles. Updated local fuel information suggests that long-term
drought-impacted fuels have not moistened enough after recent
rainfall to reduce fire weather risk. See the previous forecast for
more details.

..Wendt.. 05/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Fri May 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
Moderate southwesterly flow already established over much of the
Great Basin and Southwest is forecast to intensify ahead of a
stronger trough and mid-level jet streak moving onshore across the
West Coast Saturday. At the surface, ascent from the approaching
trough will intensify a pair of surface cyclones across the southern
Great Basin and lee of the central Rockies respectively. Enhanced by
the deepening lows and strong flow aloft, surface winds across much
of the Great Basin, Southwest and southern High Plains will likely
reach 20-30 mph. In combination with surface humidity below 15% and
dry fuels, widespread critical fire weather conditions appear
likely.

...Southwest and Four Corners...
By mid morning, low-level southwesterly winds are forecast to
increase across much of the Southwest and southern Great Basin. This
trend should continue through the afternoon in response to the
deepening surface cyclone and approaching mid-level trough. Area
model soundings show deep and well-mixed profiles, with 20-30 mph
surface winds and humidity below 10% through much of the afternoon
and into the early evening. With ongoing drought, abundant dry fuels
will support widespread critical fire weather concerns. Localized
pockets of sub 10% RH and winds near 30 mph may also support
localized extremely critical conditions for a couple of hours across
portions of eastern NM and the Four Corners.

...Southern High Plains...
Farther to the east across the southern High Plains, strong
southwesterly winds and downsloping flow are expected to increase
south of the strengthening lee low. Widespread winds of 20-25 mph
appear possible along with warm temperatures and afternoon humidity
of 8-15%. While meteorological conditions appear quite conducive to
widespread fire weather concerns, considerable uncertainty exists in
the state of area fuels after multiple days of moderate to heavy
rain. Though some drying is forecast to take place, it remains
unclear if fuels will support critical concerns at this time.
Additional expansion of the Elevated/Critical Risk areas may be
needed in subsequent outlooks should greater confidence in critical
fuels develop.

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward through the Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with a rather amplified
upper level pattern for late May, consisting of an anomalously
deep trough with embedded low in the West and ridging over much of
the East (though suppressed in the Northeast by an eastern Canada
upper low). This configuration will allow for potentially heavy
precipitation to spread from the northern Rockies into the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Higher elevation snow is
possible in the Rockies while heavy rain and severe weather are
threats in the Plains to Midwest along with warmer than normal
temperatures. As next week progresses, the mean flow aloft should
flatten quickly as the main western upper low lifts into
south-central Canada and consolidates with separate central Canada
energy to yield a fairly deep upper low. The highest precipitation
chances should shift into the central/southern Plains and across
the East along and ahead of the cold front that pushes eastward
from the Plains. Toward the end of next week an upper trough may
bring a front and some associated moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles has generally followed
through on recent trends toward faster ejection of the main
western U.S. upper low through the northern tier and then stronger
interaction with central Canada energy to yield a rather deep
upper low and vigorous surface system just southwest of Hudson Bay
by midweek. The deeper evolution ultimately leads to somewhat
faster progression of the front that begins to push eastward from
the Plains. Even with the faster trend, other 12Z models suggest
the new GFS may be too fast with the northern U.S./southern Canada
system by early Tuesday. Details of a separate weaker northwestern
U.S. upper low shearing out as the mean pattern rapidly flattens
continue to be somewhat ambiguous, and will affect frontal
wave/rainfall specifics to the east of the Rockies. Outside of the
UKMET, new 12Z models have trended stronger with this feature
through Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile there is decent agreement in
principle that energy underneath the eastern U.S. upper ridge may
try to consolidate into a closed low somewhere near the Southeast
coast/Florida/northern Bahamas by midweek. However by day 7 Friday
recent GFS/GEFS mean runs have developed a deeper and more
expansive trough covering the Southeast U.S. and eastern Gulf
relative to most other guidance. The 12Z GEFS mean trended a bit
weaker with its day 7 upper trough though.  On the northern side
of the eastern ridge, guidance is gradually consolidating toward
an episode of fairly strong cyclonic flow around a far eastern
Canada upper low. This leads to increasing potential for the
associated cold front reaching New England early in the week to
push as far south as the northern Mid-Atlantic as a backdoor front
before eventually returning north as a warm front. Consensus is
reasonable for upper ridging to retrograde from the
East/Mississippi Valley and then settle over the southern
Plains/northern Mexico, connecting with the ridge that builds over
the Interior West/Rockies. For the upper trough approaching the
West Coast late in the week, GFS runs show a little more
southeastward amplitude versus the majority at times but
ultimately model/mean differences are within typical error ranges
for forecasts that far out in time. Guidance comparisons led to
using a 00Z/06Z model blend early in the period followed by
transitioning to a model/mean mix, with slightly more weight to
the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean versus the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean (with
lingering 00Z CMC input) due to aforementioned issues over/near
the Southeast.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Early next week, the upper low emerging from the West along with
areas of low level upslope flow should combine to generate
moderate to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High
Plains. Higher elevations of the northern Rockies particularly in
southern Montana to northern Wyoming could see significant late
season snow as the anomalously deep system leads to colder than
average conditions. Farther east, rain and thunderstorms are
threats across the northern Plains into the Midwest along a wavy
front that should initially be slow to move. Along this front, a
fairly strong surface system developing over the northern tier
into southern Canada during the first half of the week may help to
focus rainfall as well. Severe weather and heavy rain are both
possibilities with this convection. As the upper pattern flattens,
lower amplitude troughing will likely move slowly eastward across
northern parts of the central and eastern U.S. and push a cold
front ahead of it into the East back into the central/southern
Plains. This front will serve as a focus for convection as it
presses east across the Ohio Valley to the Eastern Seaboard and
south across the Plains and Mississippi Valley for the latter half
of the workweek. Some moderate to heavy rainfall is possible
especially across parts of the central U.S. but still with lower
than average confidence for the areal details and amounts.
Elsewhere, Florida can expect some scattered diurnally favored
convection, aided by energy aloft to the south of the eastern U.S.
upper ridge. This convection may become more widespread by late
week. Also the Northeast may see mostly light rainfall along a
backdoor front for the first half of the workweek before the
better focus for rainfall around Thursday just ahead of the main
cold front. A front expected to push into the Northwest late in
the week may bring areas of light rainfall.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F from the Plains to the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Monday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through northern
Plains early in the week with highs forecast to be 10-20F or below
normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the initial Plains
cold front eastward while leading to a moderating trend for below
normal temperatures over the central U.S., with mostly
single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday. The East will
see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures after Wednesday. The
West Coast and into the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than
normal temperatures by around 5-10F Wednesday and beyond, followed
by modest cooler trend on Friday along the immediate West Coast
with the arrival of a Pacific front.

Plains early in the week with highs forecast to be 10-20F or below
normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the initial Plains
cold front eastward while leading to a moderating trend for below
normal temperatures over the central U.S., with mostly
single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday. The East will
see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures after Wednesday. The
West Coast and into the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than
normal temperatures by around 5-10F Wednesday and beyond, followed
by modest cooler trend on Friday along the immediate West Coast
with the arrival of a Pacific front.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 27 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 02 - 06 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the forecast mid-level
circulation pattern across the North American region. A trough is forecast
over
the southern Aleutians expanding eastward to near the West Coast with below
normal 500-hPa heights over parts of the western Aleutians and West Coast.
Downstream, a mean ridge is forecast over the Rockies northwestward to
northwestern Canada and eastern Mainland Alaska with slightly above normal
500-hPa heights over western Mainland Alaska.

Above normal temperatures are favored over Alaska under near to above norma=
l
500-hPa heights. Below normal temperatures are likely for parts of the Paci=
fic
Northwest under near to below normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal
temperatures
are likely for parts of the northern Rockies, Great Basin, and Southwest
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored over most of the north-central CONUS due to foreca=
st
near to below normal 500-hPa heights and low-level northerly flow. Above
normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi
Valley due to forecast low-level southerly flow over the region.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of eastern Mainlan=
d
Alaska, consistent with dynamical model precipitation tools. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies
ahead of a forecast trough. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts=
 of
the southern Rockies and Central Plains due to forecast low-level southerly
moisture flow and shortwave systems moving across the region. Below normal
precipitation is likely for parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississi=
ppi
Valley northward to much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region, while above
normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the Southeast and Mid
Atlantic, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=
's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools and increased model spread later in the period=
.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 04 - 10 2022

The predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period persists into the
week-2, however 500-hPa height anomalies are further weakened in the week-2
ensemble means and the manual blend due to a significant increase in
uncertainty. Weak troughing is forecast over the West Coast and eastern CON=
US.
A weak ridge persists over much of the north-central CONUS. Near average
mid-level heights are forecast over much of the forecast domain.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska consistent with t=
he
consolidation forecast tool. Below normal temperatures are favored for part=
s
of
the Pacific Northwest consistent with temperature reforecast tools. Above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Great Basin, Southwest,
Rockies, Southern Plains and parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, consist=
ent
with the temperature consolidation tool. Below normal temperatures are favo=
red
for much of the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for eastern Mainland Alaska,
while below normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of western
Alaska, consistent with the dynamical model forecasts. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the western CONUS eastward to the
Northern
Rockies and parts of the Northern Plains, ahead of a predicted mean trough.
Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the southern Fo=
ur
Corners region, supported by dynamical model precipitation tools. Below nor=
mal
precipitation is favored for parts of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi
Valley northward towards the Great Lakes, consistent with the precipitation
consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Florida Peninsula, as moisture flow is drawn northward into the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to predicted very weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the foreca=
st
domain and weak and conflicting signals in the temperature and precipitatio=
n
tools over most regions.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe storms over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast and the Northern High Plains through
Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe storms over parts of the
Northern/Central Plains from Saturday to Sunday morning...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest/Southern Rockies...

On Friday night, a front extending from the Lower Great Lakes to
the Southeast/Central Gulf Coast will slowly move off the
Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic Coast by Sunday morning. Showers
and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the boundary
through Saturday. In addition, the front and moisture pooling
along the boundary will destabilize the atmosphere. Therefore, the
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast through Saturday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, showers and thunderstorms develop along the boundary
from the Northeast to the Southeast. Therefore, the WPC has issued
a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over the Mid-Atlantic through
Saturday morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable. On Saturday, the front
continues to advance eastward. As a result, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over the Northeast, the Mid-Atlantic
Coast, and the Florida Peninsula, coming to an end overnight
Saturday.

Meanwhile, there is a complicated series of fronts moving across
the Northern High Plains to the Northern Plains by Saturday
morning. The boundaries will aid in producing light rain over
parts of the Pacific Northwest and moving into the Northern
Intermountain Region by Saturday morning. In addition, the front
will destabilize the atmosphere over the Northern High Plains.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern High Plains through
Saturday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a minimal threat of tornadoes.

The severe thunderstorm threat continues on Saturday. Therefore,
the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Northern/Central Plains from Saturday through Sunday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
minimal threat of tornadoes.

In the meantime, a third front moves onshore over the Pacific
Northwest and advances to the Northern Plains by Sunday. Light
rain will return to the Pacific Northwest by late Saturday morning
and expand into the Northern Intermountain Region by late Saturday
afternoon. Overnight Saturday, the snow levels will lower over
parts of the higher elevations. Therefore, the highest elevations
of the Cascades and Northern Rockies will get light wet snow. As
the front moves out of the Rockies onto the Plains, The threat of
severe thunderstorms returns to the Northern/Central Plains on
Sunday.

Lastly, a Critical Risk of fire weather returns to the Southwest
and the Southern Rockies on Saturday. The threat is due to strong
gusty winds, dry fuels, and low humidity.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
432 PM EDT Fri May 27 2022

Valid 12Z Mon May 30 2022 - 12Z Fri Jun 03 2022

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward through the Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with a rather amplified
upper level pattern for late May, consisting of an anomalously
deep trough with embedded low in the West and ridging over much of
the East (though suppressed in the Northeast by an eastern Canada
upper low). This configuration will allow for potentially heavy
precipitation to spread from the northern Rockies into the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Higher elevation snow is
possible in the Rockies while heavy rain and severe weather are
threats in the Plains to Midwest along with warmer than normal
temperatures. As next week progresses, the mean flow aloft should
flatten quickly as the main western upper low lifts into
south-central Canada and consolidates with separate central Canada
energy to yield a fairly deep upper low. The highest precipitation
chances should shift into the central/southern Plains and across
the East along and ahead of the cold front that pushes eastward
from the Plains. Toward the end of next week an upper trough may
bring a front and some associated moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles has generally followed
through on recent trends toward faster ejection of the main
western U.S. upper low through the northern tier and then stronger
interaction with central Canada energy to yield a rather deep
upper low and vigorous surface system just southwest of Hudson Bay
by midweek. The deeper evolution ultimately leads to somewhat
faster progression of the front that begins to push eastward from
the Plains. Even with the faster trend, other 12Z models suggest
the new GFS may be too fast with the northern U.S./southern Canada
system by early Tuesday. Details of a separate weaker northwestern
U.S. upper low shearing out as the mean pattern rapidly flattens
continue to be somewhat ambiguous, and will affect frontal
wave/rainfall specifics to the east of the Rockies. Outside of the
UKMET, new 12Z models have trended stronger with this feature
through Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile there is decent agreement in
principle that energy underneath the eastern U.S. upper ridge may
try to consolidate into a closed low somewhere near the Southeast
coast/Florida/northern Bahamas by midweek. However by day 7 Friday
recent GFS/GEFS mean runs have developed a deeper and more
expansive trough covering the Southeast U.S. and eastern Gulf
relative to most other guidance. The 12Z GEFS mean trended a bit
weaker with its day 7 upper trough though.  On the northern side
of the eastern ridge, guidance is gradually consolidating toward
an episode of fairly strong cyclonic flow around a far eastern
Canada upper low. This leads to increasing potential for the
associated cold front reaching New England early in the week to
push as far south as the northern Mid-Atlantic as a backdoor front
before eventually returning north as a warm front. Consensus is
reasonable for upper ridging to retrograde from the
East/Mississippi Valley and then settle over the southern
Plains/northern Mexico, connecting with the ridge that builds over
the Interior West/Rockies. For the upper trough approaching the
West Coast late in the week, GFS runs show a little more
southeastward amplitude versus the majority at times but
ultimately model/mean differences are within typical error ranges
for forecasts that far out in time. Guidance comparisons led to
using a 00Z/06Z model blend early in the period followed by
transitioning to a model/mean mix, with slightly more weight to
the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean versus the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean (with
lingering 00Z CMC input) due to aforementioned issues over/near
the Southeast.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Early next week, the upper low emerging from the West along with
areas of low level upslope flow should combine to generate
moderate to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High
Plains. Higher elevations of the northern Rockies particularly in
southern Montana to northern Wyoming could see significant late
season snow as the anomalously deep system leads to colder than
average conditions. Farther east, rain and thunderstorms are
threats across the northern Plains into the Midwest along a wavy
front that should initially be slow to move. Along this front, a
fairly strong surface system developing over the northern tier
into southern Canada during the first half of the week may help to
focus rainfall as well. Severe weather and heavy rain are both
possibilities with this convection. As the upper pattern flattens,
lower amplitude troughing will likely move slowly eastward across
northern parts of the central and eastern U.S. and push a cold
front ahead of it into the East back into the central/southern
Plains. This front will serve as a focus for convection as it
presses east across the Ohio Valley to the Eastern Seaboard and
south across the Plains and Mississippi Valley for the latter half
of the workweek. Some moderate to heavy rainfall is possible
especially across parts of the central U.S. but still with lower
than average confidence for the areal details and amounts.
Elsewhere, Florida can expect some scattered diurnally favored
convection, aided by energy aloft to the south of the eastern U.S.
upper ridge. This convection may become more widespread by late
week. Also the Northeast may see mostly light rainfall along a
backdoor front for the first half of the workweek before the
better focus for rainfall around Thursday just ahead of the main
cold front. A front expected to push into the Northwest late in
the week may bring areas of light rainfall.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F from the Plains to the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Monday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through northern
Plains early in the week with highs forecast to be 10-20F or below
normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the initial Plains
cold front eastward while leading to a moderating trend for below
normal temperatures over the central U.S., with mostly
single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday. The East will
see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures after Wednesday. The
West Coast and into the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than
normal temperatures by around 5-10F Wednesday and beyond, followed
by modest cooler trend on Friday along the immediate West Coast
with the arrival of a Pacific front.

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward through the Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with a rather amplified
upper level pattern for late May, consisting of an anomalously
deep trough with embedded low in the West and ridging over much of
the East (though suppressed in the Northeast by an eastern Canada
upper low). This configuration will allow for potentially heavy
precipitation to spread from the northern Rockies into the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Higher elevation snow is
possible in the Rockies while heavy rain and severe weather are
threats in the Plains to Midwest along with warmer than normal
temperatures. As next week progresses, the mean flow aloft should
flatten quickly as the main western upper low lifts into
south-central Canada and consolidates with separate central Canada
energy to yield a fairly deep upper low. The highest precipitation
chances should shift into the central/southern Plains and across
the East along and ahead of the cold front that pushes eastward
from the Plains. Toward the end of next week an upper trough may
bring a front and some associated moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Latest guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles has generally followed
through on recent trends toward faster ejection of the main
western U.S. upper low through the northern tier and then stronger
interaction with central Canada energy to yield a rather deep
upper low and vigorous surface system just southwest of Hudson Bay
by midweek. The deeper evolution ultimately leads to somewhat
faster progression of the front that begins to push eastward from
the Plains. Even with the faster trend, other 12Z models suggest
the new GFS may be too fast with the northern U.S./southern Canada
system by early Tuesday. Details of a separate weaker northwestern
U.S. upper low shearing out as the mean pattern rapidly flattens
continue to be somewhat ambiguous, and will affect frontal
wave/rainfall specifics to the east of the Rockies. Outside of the
UKMET, new 12Z models have trended stronger with this feature
through Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile there is decent agreement in
principle that energy underneath the eastern U.S. upper ridge may
try to consolidate into a closed low somewhere near the Southeast
coast/Florida/northern Bahamas by midweek. However by day 7 Friday
recent GFS/GEFS mean runs have developed a deeper and more
expansive trough covering the Southeast U.S. and eastern Gulf
relative to most other guidance. The 12Z GEFS mean trended a bit
weaker with its day 7 upper trough though.  On the northern side
of the eastern ridge, guidance is gradually consolidating toward
an episode of fairly strong cyclonic flow around a far eastern
Canada upper low. This leads to increasing potential for the
associated cold front reaching New England early in the week to
push as far south as the northern Mid-Atlantic as a backdoor front
before eventually returning north as a warm front. Consensus is
reasonable for upper ridging to retrograde from the
East/Mississippi Valley and then settle over the southern
Plains/northern Mexico, connecting with the ridge that builds over
the Interior West/Rockies. For the upper trough approaching the
West Coast late in the week, GFS runs show a little more
southeastward amplitude versus the majority at times but
ultimately model/mean differences are within typical error ranges
for forecasts that far out in time. Guidance comparisons led to
using a 00Z/06Z model blend early in the period followed by
transitioning to a model/mean mix, with slightly more weight to
the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean versus the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean (with
lingering 00Z CMC input) due to aforementioned issues over/near
the Southeast.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Early next week, the upper low emerging from the West along with
areas of low level upslope flow should combine to generate
moderate to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High
Plains. Higher elevations of the northern Rockies particularly in
southern Montana to northern Wyoming could see significant late
season snow as the anomalously deep system leads to colder than
average conditions. Farther east, rain and thunderstorms are
threats across the northern Plains into the Midwest along a wavy
front that should initially be slow to move. Along this front, a
fairly strong surface system developing over the northern tier
into southern Canada during the first half of the week may help to
focus rainfall as well. Severe weather and heavy rain are both
possibilities with this convection. As the upper pattern flattens,
lower amplitude troughing will likely move slowly eastward across
northern parts of the central and eastern U.S. and push a cold
front ahead of it into the East back into the central/southern
Plains. This front will serve as a focus for convection as it
presses east across the Ohio Valley to the Eastern Seaboard and
south across the Plains and Mississippi Valley for the latter half
of the workweek. Some moderate to heavy rainfall is possible
especially across parts of the central U.S. but still with lower
than average confidence for the areal details and amounts.
Elsewhere, Florida can expect some scattered diurnally favored
convection, aided by energy aloft to the south of the eastern U.S.
upper ridge. This convection may become more widespread by late
week. Also the Northeast may see mostly light rainfall along a
backdoor front for the first half of the workweek before the
better focus for rainfall around Thursday just ahead of the main
cold front. A front expected to push into the Northwest late in
the week may bring areas of light rainfall.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F from the Plains to the Midwest/Ohio
Valley and the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Monday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through northern
Plains early in the week with highs forecast to be 10-20F or below
normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the initial Plains
cold front eastward while leading to a moderating trend for below
normal temperatures over the central U.S., with mostly
single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday. The East will
see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures after Wednesday. The
West Coast and into the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than
normal temperatures by around 5-10F Wednesday and beyond, followed
by modest cooler trend on Friday along the immediate West Coast
with the arrival of a Pacific front.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
Moderate southwesterly flow aloft over much of the western US is
forecast to intensify ahead of a deepening mid-level trough and jet
streak across the West Coast. A pair of surface cyclones will
intensify west and east of the Rockies, supporting strong surface
winds through much of the day. Warm temperatures and low humidity
will continue to keep fuels dry and receptive to fire spread. The
favorable overlap of a warm, dry and windy conditions will support
widespread critical fire weather concerns across the Southwest and
southern High plains Saturday.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains.
Low-level winds are forecast to gradually increase through the
morning in response to strong surface heating/mixing and deepening
low pressure over the southern Great Basin. By midday, flow aloft is
forecast to strengthen as the main western US trough approaches,
bolstering southwesterly low-level flow to 20-30 mph across much of
the Four Corners and Southwest. The deep mixing/warm temperatures
will also support dry conditions with widespread surface RH of
10-15%. The overlap of strong and gusty surface winds should easily
support widespread critical fire weather concerns across much of the
southern Great Basin, Four Corners and Southwest Saturday.

Farther to the east across the southern High Plains, strong
downslope winds are expected to increase south of the strengthening
lee low. Widespread winds of 20-25 mph appear possible along with
warm temperatures and afternoon humidity of 8-15%. Widespread
critical conditions are expected within drying fuels. Localized
high-end critical and extremely critical conditions may also develop
for a few hours across portions of northeastern NM, where surface
gusts aided by local terrain and a subtle mid-level jet may reach
30+ mph.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN GREAT
BASIN...SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
Western US troughing will continue to amplify across the Southwest
as a significant shortwave feature within this broader southwesterly
flow ejects eastward. Forecast to reach the Rockies late Sunday,
lift from the trough will deepen a lee cyclone across the High
Plains as a cold front stalls across central Great Basin. Widespread
strong surface winds are expected ahead of the trough from the
southern Great Basin to the High Plains. The strong winds will
overlap with a warm and very dry airmass supporting widespread
critical fire weather conditions Sunday.

...Southern Great Basin and Southeast...
40-50 kt mid-level flow and a deepening lee cyclone will once again
promote a significant diurnal increase in southwesterly low-level
flow across much of the Southwest. 20-25 mph surface winds,
strongest along and south of a stalled front across the southern
Great Basin, will overlap with a very dry and warm surface airmass
characterized by 10-15% RH. Widespread critical fire weather
conditions are again expected within very dry and drought-stressed
fuels. Localized extremely critical conditions may also develop
across portions of northwestern NM immediately ahead of the
mid-level southwesterly jet. Aided by downward momentum transfer and
terrain influences, hi-res ensemble guidance shows some potential
for surface winds greater than 30 mph overlapping with sub 10%
surface humidity. While limited in spatial and temporal overlap,
strong winds and volatile fuel states suggest higher-end fire
weather concerns are possible.

...Southern High Plains...
With ascent from the aforementioned mid-level wave moving over the
Rockies, a strengthening lee low and surface dryline will promote
strong southwesterly surface winds across much of the southern and
central High Plains. Downslope winds and warm surface temperatures
should easily support widespread elevated and critical fire weather
conditions from eastern NM, through the Panhandles and into
southeastern CO where fuels remain quite dry. Stronger gusts aided
by terrain may also support localized extremely critical conditions,
though coverage is uncertain.

Farther north, surface winds of 15-20 mph and RH of 15-20% should
support elevated fire weather conditions across northern and central
CO. Moisture return moving west toward the higher terrain may also
support a few high-based thunderstorms later in the afternoon. While
not expected to reach coverage requirements for Isolated Dry Thunder
Area, a few lightning strikes will be possible within dry fuels near
the cold front.

...Multiple rounds of heavy rainfall are expected across
central/southern parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley next
week...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Tuesday with an amplified pattern
consisting of troughing over the West and an upper low across the
central U.S. while ridging prevails across the Gulf Coast states
into the East, with the exception of the Northeast where the ridge
is suppressed by an eastern Canada upper low. The upper pattern
should flatten across the lower 48 as energy consolidates into a
fairly deep upper low across central Canada, but troughing
extending from the low will shift a cold front southeastward as
next week progresses, providing a focus for rain especially over
the central/southern Plains and the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley where multiple rounds of convection are likely.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

On day 3/Tuesday as the period begins, there are already some
differences with the details of energy within the western to
north-central U.S. trough. The 12Z and newer 00Z ECMWF/UKMET as
well as the 12Z EC ensemble mean agree with the existence and
position of a closed upper low near the North Dakota/Minnesota
border Tuesday morning, and CMC runs are similar though not quite
a closed low (depending on the contour interval). However GFS runs
seem to be the outliers with more strung out upper energy in the
area in the 18Z and 00Z runs, while the 12Z showed a closed low
but to the northeast of consensus, and the surface lows showed the
same fast/northeast position. So favored the non-NCEP consensus
early in the period, but by day 4/Wednesday models including the
GFS generally come to better agreement with a consolidated low in
central Canada. There are still some questions with additional
upstream energy Tuesday-Wednesday around the Great Basin to
central Rockies as to whether there could be an additional small
closed low and how long the energy will last before getting
absorbed into the mean flow. A multi-model blend seemed reasonable
though there is variety in the details.

Elsewhere, model guidance is agreeable with initial ridging from
the south-central to eastern U.S. before an upper high/ridge
retrogrades toward the southern Plains/northern Mexico, connecting
with the ridge that builds over the Interior West/Rockies.
Meanwhile upper energy looks to slowly drift west across the
western Atlantic toward Florida Wednesday-Thursday, but with
uncertainty in its strength, and then questions as to whether it
could merge with troughing across the East. GFS runs show this
trough merge more than other guidance, likely because it also
combines with energy stemming from what is currently Tropical
Depression One-E in the eastern Pacific. There is ample
uncertainty with the potential for any redevelopment of the
feature and its track and timing, but if any energy or a feature
does persist or redevelop, a track as fast as the GFS runs seems
unlikely as other guidance is much slower. Then troughing is
expected to come into the Northwest late week stemming from an
upper low in the eastern Pacific, with about average confidence
and a trend toward a farther south upper low in the newer 00Z
guidance.

Thus the WPC medium range forecast utilized a multi-model
deterministic blend early in the period favoring the ECMWF, then
phasing in the GEFS and EC ensemble means to half by the end of
the period to reduce the influence of individual model runs.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The surface low pressure system lifting into central Canada
beginning Tuesday will send a cold front across the north-central
U.S. and across the northeastern quadrant through the latter part
of the workweek. Rain is possible first across North Dakota and
the Upper Midwest to Great Lakes along this front Tuesday and then
shifting eastward across the Ohio Valley and into the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic by Thursday, after some initial showers in
parts of the Northeast Tuesday-Wednesday near a backdoor front.
However, the back end of the main front is forecast to move more
slowly through central and southern parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley, and will provide a focus for rain and
thunderstorms for multiple days around Tuesday-Thursday. Flash
flooding is possible especially where storms repeat over the same
area, which at this point appears most likely to occur around
Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, but with uncertainty in the
details beyond that.

Elsewhere, Florida could see a showery pattern next week as weak
upper-level energy passes through, with diurnally favored
convection. This may increase by late next week as there is
potential for moisture and energy associated with what is
currently Tropical Depression One-E in the eastern Pacific to lift
into the Gulf of Mexico. There is ample uncertainty with the
potential for any redevelopment of the feature and its track and
timing, but regardless it could enhance moisture and rainfall
potential over Florida. The Northwest can expect increasing
precipitation (most likely rain) chances later in the week as a
front pushes through the region.

The eastern U.S./Mississippi Valley upper ridge will promote above
average temperatures by 10-20F over the Midwest/Ohio Valley and
parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Tuesday-Wednesday, with some
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures possible. The
backdoor front reaching New England and possibly as far south as
the northern Mid-Atlantic would bring a cooler trend to these
areas though. Meanwhile upper troughing will bring very cool
temperatures to areas from the Intermountain West through
northern/central Plains through midweek with highs forecast to be
10-20F or below normal. The flattening pattern aloft will push the
initial Plains cold front eastward while leading to a moderating
trend for below normal temperatures over the central U.S., with
mostly single-digit negative anomalies by Thursday-Friday, though
around 10F below normal in rain-cooled Kansas and Oklahoma. The
East should see shrinking coverage of warm temperatures on
Thursday and especially Friday-Saturday. The West Coast and into
the Great Basin could flip back to warmer than normal temperatures
by around 5-15F Wednesday and beyond, followed by a modest cooler
trend on Friday-Saturday along the immediate West Coast with the
arrival of a Pacific front.

...There will be locally a threat of heavy rain and some strong
thunderstorms across parts of the Northeast today...

...Much colder and unsettled weather will arrive across the
Intermountain West this weekend which will include a threat of
heavy snowfall for the higher elevations of the Northern Rockies...

...Severe weather will be possible across portions of the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest through the weekend...

...Critical fire weather concerns continue across much of the
Southwest and through the Southern Rockies...

A cold front will be very slowly advancing toward the East Coast
today and then offshore on Sunday as high pressure builds in from
the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. However, multiple waves of low
pressure will be impacting the Northeast today and there should be
areas of showers thunderstorms impacting parts of the northern
Mid-Atlantic and New England which will result in some areas of
locally heavy rainfall. An isolated threat of flash flooding will
be possible and some of the thunderstorms may be strong and
capable of producing gusty winds. Drier and more tranquil weather
will follow on Sunday and linger through early next week.

Meanwhile, a series of cold fronts and waves of low pressure will
continue to move inland off the Pacific Ocean and will be
traversing the Intermountain West through the weekend which will
bring much colder temperatures and unsettled weather. This will
especially be the case for the Pacific Northwest, the northern
Great Basin, and the northern Rockies where widespread shower
activity and some locally heavy rainfall is expected. As an
upper-level trough deepens over the West this weekend and early
next week, the snow levels will be dropping, and rain is expected
to change over to heavy snow for the higher terrain of the
northern Rockies. In fact, some of the higher terrain of the
Sawtooth, Absoroka, and Big Horn mountains will see locally
significant snowfall. The heaviest amounts will likely be over the
Absoroka range involving areas of southwest Montana where as much
as 2 to 3 feet of snow appears likely. All of the rain and snow
that does impact the West this weekend will be very beneficial
given the widespread and long-term drought conditions that
continue for many areas. Temperatures this weekend behind the
frontal passages will be below normal, and some parts of northern
Great Basin will likely see high temperatures as much as
15 to 25 degrees below normal by Sunday.

Gradually the energy crossing the Intermountain West will also
eject out across the northern Plains and the upper Midwest through
the end of the weekend and into Monday, and this will yield a
concern for severe weather. Multiple rounds of heavy showers and
thunderstorms are expected, and some of the thunderstorms over the
next couple of days will be capable of producing damaging winds
and large hail. On Sunday and Sunday night, the severe weather
threat will be more focused and concentrated from eastern Nebraska
through southwest Minnesota and the Storm Prediction Center has
highlighted this area under an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms which will include a concern for a few tornadoes.

Ahead of the much colder weather across the West, hot and dry
conditions will be expected across areas of the central and
southern Plains where high temperatures will warm well into the
90s and will locally exceed 100 degrees today. Some of these
temperatures will be as much as 20 to 25 degrees above average.
The hot and dry weather will also be a key player in driving
elevated to critical fire weather concerns. In fact, the wildfire
danger will encompass a rather large area again with an emphasis
on the southern Rockies and through much of the Southwest U.S.
going through the weekend. Very low relative humidity and gusty
winds will be in place and these conditions will be conducive for
locally driving a high threat of wildfire activity.

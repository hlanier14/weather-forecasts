Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO...

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed.
Morning surface observations across central to eastern NM show a
gradient in low-level moisture with dewpoints in the low 30s noted
across the eastern plains of NM. This moisture has reduced
confidence in the eastern extent of critical wind/RH conditions this
afternoon with most morning guidance showing RH reductions into the
15-20% range for the eastern plains. To the west across central NM
and AZ, RH values are already falling into the 20s, and should
continue to fall through the afternoon as winds increase and drier
boundary-layer air (noted in the 12 UTC ABQ and FGZ soundings) mixes
to the surface. See the previous discussion below for additional
details.

..Moore.. 05/03/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1246 AM CDT Tue May 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough within the Great Basin will move into the
central Rockies today. A deep surface low will develop in eastern
Colorado and slowly shift into eastern New Mexico through the day.
Mid-level winds will strengthen as the trough approaches and the
strong surface pressure gradient will drive westerly/southwesterly
winds across much of Arizona and New Mexico. A Pacific front will
move through the Great Basin and into Arizona.

...Southwest...
Critical fire weather is expected during the afternoon. Surface
winds will reach 20-25 mph from northwest Arizona into western and
central New Mexico. Some higher speeds are possible locally. Dry air
will remain across the region. As the trough moves in, some
higher-level moisture may be brought northward. This will mean an
increase in high-level clouds which could impact afternoon RH. Even
with some cloud cover potential, values of 10-15% are still
expected. Elevated conditions are expected within southeast Arizona
and eastern New Mexico where winds will be 15-20 mph with 15-20% RH.

...Southern Nevada...
Strong northerly winds behind the cold front will develop relatively
early in the day. The post-front airmass will remain dry and
humidity could fall to near 20% early and to near 10% later in the
day. The strongest winds (20 mph) are expected earlier in the day
and may not overlap much with critically low RH. Elevated fire
weather is expected.

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TO NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast remains generally on track with only minor
adjustments needed based on latest guidance. There is some
uncertainty regarding the eastern extent of the fire weather concern
behind a sharpening dryline across western TX. This feature is
currently expected to be roughly along the I-27 corridor, but the
exact longitudinal placement by peak heating remains somewhat
uncertain. Furthermore, early morning rain and afternoon
thunderstorms in proximity to this boundary may mitigate fuel
receptiveness on the eastern extent of the outlook area. Further
refinements are possible as confidence in the dryline placement and
rainfall forecast increase.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Tue May 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough over the Rockies will eventually eject into the
central Plains on Wednesday. Stronger mid-level flow will exist more
broadly across the Southwest. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen
in eastern New Mexico and drive downslope flow across the state.

...New Mexico...
Fire weather concerns will be focused across southern, central and
eastern portions of the state. As compared to Tuesday, mid-level
winds will be stronger over a broader area, particularly in the
south. Surface winds will also be more westerly and favor drier
conditions. Afternoon RH is expected to fall to 5-15%. Winds of
20-25 mph are also expected. Some of the higher elevation areas in
the Critical highlights may only see Elevated conditions due to
slightly higher RH values.

...Enhanced rainfall threat with closed low track into
Friday/Saturday from the Ohio Valley to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday into next week...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking from the central to eastern U.S. this period, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the better
clustered and slower recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean solutions. The WPC forecast continues to lean
towards the slower side of the forecast envelope, given
continuity, but also the general nature of a separated southern
stream flow with an embedded closed system.

The 06z GFS/GEFS continues a pattern of more progressive and
amplified troughing in the central and eastern portion of the
country early in the medium range period. A blend of 00z
EC/ECE/CMC/UK seems to mitigate the timing and intensity issues
caused by the GFS/GEFS through D4 at which point the Midwest-East
coast system should have pushed out to sea. A 00z EC/ECE/CMC blend
is utilized from D5-D7 due to the continued progressive nature of
a western trough in the 06z GFS/GEFS.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains/lower
Mississippi Valley Friday to the Ohio Valley then
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic over the weekend. Strong storms are
possible into the weekend with the slow/steady downstream track of
the system. Upper diffluence, ample moisture inflow, and
instability will also offer a threat for enhanced comma head and
wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall focus from the mid-lower
Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West this period as an amplified
mean upper trough and wavy/well defined frontal systems become
established over the region Friday into next week. This will
support significant cooling and bring a widespread precipitation
focus from the Northwest through the north-central Great
Basin/Rockies to include a substantial and lingering threat for
heavy terrain focusing snows. These troughs will support
temperatures as much as 10-20 degrees below normal across a large
portion of the West. Upper dynamics and slow wavy frontal
translation should also support an emerging convection/rainfall
pattern with local runoff concerns across the north-central U.S.
by later weekend/early next week, albeit with less certain system
details at these longer time frames. The Storm Prediction Center
has highlighted areas of concern for Severe Weather over portions
of the Central Plains and Middle Mississppii Valley between Sunday
and Monday. Localized heavy rainfall could lead to runoff issues
as the region has experienced quite a bit of rain in April.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 03 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 09 - 13 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in predicting an amplified
500-hPa height pattern across much of North America early in the period. A
strong, anomalous trough is forecast over the western CONUS on day 6, with
anomalous downstream ridging predicted over eastern Canada. A trough is
forecast farther to the east, off the east coast of the CONUS, which would
promote anomalous onshore flow across much of the Mid-Atlantic region and t=
he
coastal Southeast. As the period progresses, model solutions are slower in
de-amplifying the overall pattern relative to yesterday, with the
ECMWF/Canadian ensemble means persisting a distinct trough-ridge pattern
across
the CONUS through day 10. The GEFS is more progressive in moving the trough
eastward to the Plains by the end of the period. Regardless of differences =
in
progressiveness, models generally agree in weakening the trough towards the
end
of the 6-10 day period, but at a slower pace relative to yesterday. In
response
to the trough in the West, the ECMWF/Canadian solutions maintain strong
ridging
in eastern Canada throughout the period while the GEFS is generally weaker
with
this feature. Farther to the north, models are in good agreement in
maintaining
mean troughing over most of Mainland Alaska, ahead of a strong ridge foreca=
st
over the Aleutians.

Predicted strong troughing (particularly early in the period), leads to
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures across most of the west=
ern
CONUS.  Increased southerly flow ahead of this trough favors enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures across much of the Southern Plai=
ns,
east-central CONUS, and Northeast. Below normal temperatures are slightly
favored for parts of the Mid-Atlantic coast, due to the potential for a
prolonged period of anomalous onshore flow. Below normal temperature
probabilities are enhanced for most of central and southern Mainland Alaska=
 as
well as the Panhandle, due to mean troughing forecast across much of the
state.

An active pattern is favored for much of the central CONUS, due to the
likelihood of anomalous southerly flow and associated moisture advection ah=
ead
of the deep trough predicted over the western CONUS. Therefore, probabiliti=
es
of above normal precipitation are enhanced for most of the Plains, Upper an=
d
Middle Mississippi Valley, and much of the Central and Northern Rockies. A
drying trend is possible behind the mean trough axis in the West, but with
models now slower in weakening the trough over the western CONUS relative t=
o
yesterday, there is greater uncertainty as to how quickly this will occur.
Therefore, enhanced probabilities of near normal precipitation is indicated
along the West Coast owing to this increased uncertainty. Ridging over east=
ern
North America leads to elevated chances of below normal precipitation for m=
ost
of the eastern third of the CONUS. However, the potential for enhanced onsh=
ore
flow results in increased probabilities for near to above normal precipitat=
ion
for the coastal Southeast. Near to above normal precipitation is favored fo=
r
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to mean troughing. Conversely, near t=
o
below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the Aleutians due to
predicted ridging.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, a=
nd
30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on an amplified pattern persisting through much of the
period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 11 - 17 2022

During week-2, the overall 500-hPa flow is forecast to transition to a less
amplified pattern across much of North America. However, this transition is
generally forecast to be slower relative to yesterday. Residual anomalous
troughing over the western CONUS is generally predicted to persist through =
the
middle of the period with transition to a more zonal pattern occurring towa=
rd
the end of week-2. In response, negative height anomalies in the West and
positive height anomalies over eastern North America are forecast to gradua=
lly
weaken with time. Mean troughing is likely to persist over Mainland Alaska
throughout the period but with only modest height anomalies. More significa=
nt
height anomalies are predicted across the Aleutians as above normal heights
are
forecast in association with mean ridging.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the western CONUS due to
residual troughing forecast through the middle of the period. Probabilities=
 of
above normal temperatures are elevated for most of the eastern third of the
CONUS as well as much of the Southern Plains. Probabilities of below in the
West and above across much of the East are generally higher than yesterday,
corresponding to the model trend of a slower pattern de-amplification relat=
ive
to yesterday. Enhanced onshore flow reduces probabilities of above normal
temperatures for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast coastal regions.
Persistent troughing leads to elevated chances of near to below normal
temperatures across Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle.

Chances of above normal precipitation are elevated for much of the Northern
and
Central Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley, ahead of the trough foreca=
st
over the western CONUS. Conversely, below normal precipitation is most like=
ly
for most of California and the Southwest, due to predicted ridging offshore=
 of
the West Coast. Below normal precipitation is favored for much of the
Northeast, in association with anomalous ridging predicted over eastern
Canada.
Conversely, there is a slight tilt toward above normal precipitation for pa=
rts
of the Florida Peninsula due to predicted mean troughing in the vicinity.
Above
normal precipitation is also favored for most of Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, as troughing is forecast to persist ahead of mean ridging foreca=
st
over the Aleutians. Near to below normal precipitation is likely for the
Aleutians, near the center of the predicted mean ridging.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 40=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
fairly amplified pattern predicted early in the period offset by a gradual
transition to a lower amplitude pattern by the end of week-2.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Enhanced rainfall threat with closed low track into
Friday/Saturday from the Ohio Valley to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday into next week...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking from the central to eastern U.S. this period, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the better
clustered and slower recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean solutions. The WPC forecast continues to lean
towards the slower side of the forecast envelope, given
continuity, but also the general nature of a separated southern
stream flow with an embedded closed system.

The 06z GFS/GEFS continues a pattern of more progressive and
amplified troughing in the central and eastern portion of the
country early in the medium range period. A blend of 00z
EC/ECE/CMC/UK seems to mitigate the timing and intensity issues
caused by the GFS/GEFS through D4 at which point the Midwest-East
coast system should have pushed out to sea. A 00z EC/ECE/CMC blend
is utilized from D5-D7 due to the continued progressive nature of
a western trough in the 06z GFS/GEFS.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains/lower
Mississippi Valley Friday to the Ohio Valley then
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic over the weekend. Strong storms are
possible into the weekend with the slow/steady downstream track of
the system. Upper diffluence, ample moisture inflow, and
instability will also offer a threat for enhanced comma head and
wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall focus from the mid-lower
Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West this period as an amplified
mean upper trough and wavy/well defined frontal systems become
established over the region Friday into next week. This will
support significant cooling and bring a widespread precipitation
focus from the Northwest through the north-central Great
Basin/Rockies to include a substantial and lingering threat for
heavy terrain focusing snows. These troughs will support
temperatures as much as 10-20 degrees below normal across a large
portion of the West. Upper dynamics and slow wavy frontal
translation should also support an emerging convection/rainfall
pattern with local runoff concerns across the north-central U.S.
by later weekend/early next week, albeit with less certain system
details at these longer time frames. The Storm Prediction Center
has highlighted areas of concern for Severe Weather over portions
of the Central Plains and Middle Mississppii Valley between Sunday
and Monday. Localized heavy rainfall could lead to runoff issues
as the region has experienced quite a bit of rain in April.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 03 2022

SYNOPSIS: Week-2 starts with a strong mid-level ridge over eastern North
America, which will keep a threat for excessive heat in parts of the
Mississippi Valley and western Gulf Coast regions during the first half of =
the
period. Temperature anomalies will probably be higher from the northern Ohi=
o
Valley through the Great Lakes and Northeast, which is closer to the center=
 of
largest 500-hPa anomalies, but temperatures here will likely remain below t=
he
hazards threshold in an absolute sense. Farther west, cold air will have
settled into much of the western CONUS, and there=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs a slight chance for much
below normal temperatures in much of the western half of the country during
May
11 -12 before temperatures modify. Meanwhile, a mid-level trough and surfac=
e
storm system should be moving through the central CONUS early week-2. This
will
enhance chances for heavy precipitation in parts of the south-central and
east-central Great Plains while an episode of high winds could affect large
parts of the Plains. As week-2 progresses, the pattern becomes less amplifi=
ed,
reducing the risk for hazards for the latter half of the period. Finally, s=
now
and ice melt will continue to cause flooding near the Red River of the Nort=
h
and the James River. Central and eastern Alaska also has an enhanced risk o=
f
flooding for the same reason.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across most of the central Hi=
gh
Plains, Rockies, Intermountain West, and Great Basin, Wed-Thu, May 11-12

Slight risk of excessive heat in parts of the western Gulf Coast and the lo=
wer
Mississippi Valley, Wed-Fri, May 11-13

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the eastern and south-centr=
al
Great Plains, Wed-Thu, May 11-12

Slight risk of high winds over much of the Great Plains, Wed-Thu, May 11-12

Possible flooding along the Red River of the North and part of the James Ri=

agreement on anomalous 500-hPa ridging, there is an increased risk of
excessive
heat for the western Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures
could reach the mid-90=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs to near 100 deg. F acros=
s parts of the south-
central
CONUS early in week-2. Temperature anomalies will probably be higher farthe=
r
to
the north, from the northern Ohio Valley through the Great Lakes and
Northeast,
which is closer to the center of largest 500-hPa anomalies. But temperature=
s
will likely remain below hazards thresholds there in an absolute sense.
Farther west, the week starts with cold air over the interior western CONUS=
.
This moves eastward and modifies by mid-week, but not before much below nor=
mal
temperatures threaten much of the region early week-2. Some re-forecast too=
ls
bring temperatures below 40 deg. F south of the Mexican border May 11-12.



Between the two extremes of temperature, there is general agreement that so=
me
sort of storm will be affecting the central CONUS, increasing the likelihoo=
d
that heavy precipitation and high winds will affect parts of the central
states
early in the period. Models are slightly more clustered around this scenari=
o
than they were yesterday, though there is some continued inconsistency in t=
he
timing and strength of this storm system. But after day 9 (Thu. May 12), al=
l
models show a deamplifying pattern that will weaken the storm system as it
pushes off to the northeast, ending the hazards threat. Most models show a
de-amplifying, more-progressive pattern evolving as week-2 progresses,
lowering
the chances for storminess and hazards.



A persistent, long-lasting easterly flow will develop along parts of the

This could cause dangerously high surf, beach erosion, strong rip tides,
particularly along the southern half of the coastline. The surf could build=
 to
over 8 feet in some areas.



Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the North=
,
and extend into part of the James River basin, primarily due to melting sno=
w
and ice. Flooding is also possible through week-2 in parts of central and
eastern Alaska for the same reason.

SYNOPSIS: Week-2 starts with a strong mid-level ridge over eastern North
America, which will keep a threat for excessive heat in parts of the
Mississippi Valley and western Gulf Coast regions during the first half of =
the
period. Temperature anomalies will probably be higher from the northern Ohi=
o
Valley through the Great Lakes and Northeast, which is closer to the center=
 of
largest 500-hPa anomalies, but temperatures here will likely remain below t=
he
hazards threshold in an absolute sense. Farther west, cold air will have
settled into much of the western CONUS, and there=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs a slight chance for much
below normal temperatures in much of the western half of the country during
May
11 -12 before temperatures modify. Meanwhile, a mid-level trough and surfac=
e
storm system should be moving through the central CONUS early week-2. This
will
enhance chances for heavy precipitation in parts of the south-central and
east-central Great Plains while an episode of high winds could affect large
parts of the Plains. As week-2 progresses, the pattern becomes less amplifi=
ed,
reducing the risk for hazards for the latter half of the period. Finally, s=
now
and ice melt will continue to cause flooding near the Red River of the Nort=
h
and the James River. Central and eastern Alaska also has an enhanced risk o=
f
flooding for the same reason.

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 11 - TUESDAY MAY 17: The GEFS - an outlier yesterday - is
now
supportive of the other models to some extent, with features moving more
slowly
and remaining more amplified than indicated yesterday. Based on improved mo=
del
agreement on anomalous 500-hPa ridging, there is an increased risk of
excessive
heat for the western Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley. Temperatures
could reach the mid-90=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs to near 100 deg. F acros=
s parts of the south-
central
CONUS early in week-2. Temperature anomalies will probably be higher farthe=

the north, from the northern Ohio Valley through the Great Lakes and
Northeast,

...There is a Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms across parts
of the Central Plains on Wednesday...

...Heavy rain and potential flooding across parts of the
south-central U.S. on Wednesday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies/Southwest...

The weather pattern will remain quite active from the Rockies to
the Appalachians through Thursday as a well organized storm system
takes shape across Colorado.  This low pressure system will emerge
over the southern High Plains by Wednesday afternoon, and then
progress towards Missouri by late Thursday.  One of the hazards
from this event will be the plethora of heavy rainfall that is
forecast from northern Texas to western Missouri, with the highest
totals likely over eastern Oklahoma where a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall is in effect for Wednesday.  The potential
exists for patchy areas of 3-5 inch rainfall by Thursday evening,
and training convection with rainfall rates well over an inch per
hour in some instances could easily lead to flash flooding.
Another hazard will be the Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms
across this same general area in the warm sector of the low, with
the potential for tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.

Elsewhere across the nation, fire weather concerns will be making
weather headlines across much of New Mexico and portions of
Arizona and western Texas through midweek, with hot temperatures,
extremely low humidity, and gusty winds increasing the potential
for wildfires.  In addition, degraded air quality is likely in
some areas owing to wildfire smoke and also blowing dust.  For the
eastern U.S., scattered showers and storms are likely for tonight
and into Wednesday ahead of a cold front, and some of these storms
could also be strong to severe.  For the Pacific Northwest,
showers and high elevation snow returns on Thursday as a Pacific
storm system enters the region.

In terms of temperatures, it will remain rather cool across the
north-central U.S. and Great Lakes region, with highs running 10
to 20 degrees below average in many cases.  On the contrary, it
will remain warm and humid across the Southeast and Gulf Coast
region with the cold front not making much progress past the
southern Tennessee border through the middle of the week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough across the Four Corners and central
Rockies will move eastward into the central/southern Plains today. A
surface cyclone will deepen in eastern New Mexico. Fire weather
concerns will be focused across New Mexico.

...New Mexico into West Texas...
Strong surface winds are expected to develop behind a composite
front/dryline in West Texas. Winds of 20-25 mph are probable across
much southern, central, and northeastern New Mexico. RH of 10-15%
will be common, but locally 5-10% is possible. Critical conditions
may extend into parts of the Texas Panhandle and South Plains at
least briefly. With modest uncertainty in the dryline position and
possible South Plains precipitation this morning, Elevated
highlights will be maintained in these areas.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 AM CDT Wed May 04 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
Shortwave ridging aloft will be present across the Southwest on
Thursday. Broadly cyclonic flow will move into parts of the
Northwest. A strong mid-level jet will exist across the Sierra into
the Great Basin by late afternoon. At the surface, modest flow aloft
across the southern Rockies may deepen a surface trough in eastern
New Mexico. Similarly, weak surface troughing is expected in the
central Great Basin.

...Central New Mexico...
A spatially limited area of Elevated fire weather is possible as
surface winds increase in response to the weak lee trough. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected along with 10-15% RH. It is possible locally
Critical conditions could develop where terrain-enhanced winds
exceed 20 mph.

...Southern Nevada...
Strong heating in the region could bring temperatures into the 80s
to near 90 F. Given the weak surface trough, it is not clear how
widespread 15-20 mph winds will be. RH will likely fall to near 10%,
however. Locally elevated conditions are possible.

...North-central Great Basin/Rockies cold heavy snow threat to
contrast emerging north-central U.S. convection and record
south-central U.S to Midwest heat pattern with Omega-style block
development this weekend into next week...
...Lead Mid-Atlantic rainfall threat into Saturday with the closed
low to settle over a blocked western Atlantic next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Model and ensemble solutions still offer pesky embedded system
timing and emphasis differences, but have overall converged upon a
better clustered mid-larger scale pattern evolution highlighted by
Omega-style block development over the lower 48 and vicinity. A
composite of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS along with the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, ECMWF ensemble mean and 01 UTC National
Blend of Models seems to present a reasonable forecast basis while
tending to mitigate embedded system variance consistent with a
pattern with near normal predictability Saturday into Monday. The
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain best clustered and
in line with WPC continuity and the NBM Monday-next Wednesday.
Despite better similarities, recent run-run guidance continuity
issues offers caution with embedded feature details. Most of the
newer 00 UTC guidance maintain similar trends from earlier
guidance, but the Canadian is not as diggy over the western
Atlantic.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A leading closed upper trough and well organized surface
low/frontal system will track from the Ohio Valley through the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this weekend. Some strong storms and
locally heavy downpours are possible considering slow system track
and pooled moisture/instability. The system will then stall and
retrograde over the western Atlantic next week as part of a
developing Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West later this week into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Uncertain upper system ejections channeled between amplified
eastern Pacific upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and
amplified east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the
aforementioned Omega-style block over the lower 48 will trap a
slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging convection/rainfall pattern. This offers a
runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains soil conditions.
The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a concern for severe
weather into the eastern Central Plains for at least Sunday and
Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high tempertures over
the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth gradually building
northeastward next week through the MS/TN Valleys/Midwest under
the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the wintry conditions over
the West and moderated/cooled high pressure dammed airmass to
linger over the East on the backside of a difficult to dislodge
western Atlantic circulation.

...North-central Great Basin/Rockies cold heavy snow threat to
contrast emerging north-central U.S. convection and record
south-central U.S to Midwest heat pattern with Omega-style block
development this weekend into next week...
...Lead Mid-Atlantic rainfall threat into Saturday with the closed
low to settle over a blocked western Atlantic next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Model and ensemble solutions still offer pesky embedded system
timing and emphasis differences, but have overall converged upon a
better clustered mid-larger scale pattern evolution highlighted by
Omega-style block development over the lower 48 and vicinity. A
composite of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS along with the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, ECMWF ensemble mean and 01 UTC National
Blend of Models seems to present a reasonable forecast basis while
tending to mitigate embedded system variance consistent with a
pattern with near normal predictability Saturday into Monday. The
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means remain best clustered and
in line with WPC continuity and the NBM Monday-next Wednesday.
Despite better similarities, recent run-run guidance continuity
issues offers caution with embedded feature details. Most of the
newer 00 UTC guidance maintain similar trends from earlier
guidance, but the Canadian is not as diggy over the western
Atlantic.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A leading closed upper trough and well organized surface
low/frontal system will track from the Ohio Valley through the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic this weekend. Some strong storms and
locally heavy downpours are possible considering slow system track
and pooled moisture/instability. The system will then stall and
retrograde over the western Atlantic next week as part of a
developing Omega-style block.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West later this week into next
week as an amplified mean upper trough and wavy frontal systems
become established over the region. This will support significant
cooling to include spotty record values along with a widespread
precipitation focus from the Northwest/Sierra through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies. This will include a substantial
and lingering threat for widespread heavy snows as further
enhanced in favored terrain. Expect temperatures to range as much
as 10-20 degrees below normal.

Uncertain upper system ejections channeled between amplified
eastern Pacific upper ridging/upper troughing over the West and
amplified east-central U.S. upper ridging as part of the
aforementioned Omega-style block over the lower 48 will trap a
slow moving and wavy frontal zone over the north-central U.S. to
support an emerging convection/rainfall pattern. This offers a
runoff threat given moist ambient Northern Plains soil conditions.
The Storm Prediction Center also highlights a concern for severe
weather into the eastern Central Plains for at least Sunday and
Monday. The pattern meanwhile favors record high tempertures over
the south-central U.S., with pre-frontal warmth gradually building
northeastward next week through the MS/TN Valleys/Midwest under
the upper ridge, in stark contrast to the wintry conditions over
the West and moderated/cooled high pressure dammed airmass to
linger over the East on the backside of a difficult to dislodge
western Atlantic circulation.

On Wednesday and Thursday, heavy rain and severe thunderstorms
will develop over portions of the Central/Southern Plains and
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies...

On Wednesday, low pressure over the Lower Great Lakes will move
off the New England Coast overnight Wednesday. The associated
front will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms from
Southern New England southward over the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast. There will be a marginal risk of severe thunderstorms
over the southern Mid-Atlantic through Thursday morning. Light
rain will also develop over other parts of the Northeast through
overnight Wednesday.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, a wave of low pressure over the Southern
High Plains will slowly move to the Middle Mississippi Valley by
Friday. The low will draw moisture over the Southern/Central
Plains as the associated boundary aids in destabilizing the
atmosphere producing showers and thunderstorms over parts of the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.
Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over the Southern Plains through Thursday morning.
The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. In addition, there is an increased risk for EF2 to EF5
tornadoes and large hail, two inches or greater, over parts of the
area.

In addition, heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over parts of
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
through Thursday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may
flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.

The severe thunderstorm threat moves slightly eastward on
Thursday. As a result, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley from Thursday through Friday morning. The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.

In addition, the threat of excessive rainfall will continue,
however, at a slightly lower threshold. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains on Thursday
through Friday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams being the most vulnerable. Additionally, showers
and thunderstorms will move over parts of the Ohio Valley into The
Mid-Atlantic on Thursday into Friday morning.

Moreover, overnight Wednesday, upper-level energy will begin to
move onshore over the Pacific Northwest, producing light rain over
the Northwest. The light rain will start to move into Northern
California by late Thursday morning. Additionally, on Thursday
morning, another front will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest, moving inland and regenerating over the Northern High
Plains/Great Basin by Friday. Late Thursday afternoon, light snow
will develop over parts of the Cascades as rain and higher
elevation snow develops over parts of the Northern Intermountain
Region.

Furthermore, the SPC issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
the Southern Rockies on Wednesday. The fire weather threat is due
to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low relative humidity. On Thursday,
the threat of fire weather decreases to an Elevated Risk over a
small area of the Southern Rockies.

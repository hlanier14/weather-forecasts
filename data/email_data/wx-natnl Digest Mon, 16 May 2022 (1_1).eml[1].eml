Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Sun May 15 2022

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

An Elevated area was added over parts of the TX South Plains into
Northwest TX. Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track.

Ahead of a southward-advancing cold front currently located over the
TX Panhandle, a narrow corridor of elevated conditions will be
possible from the TX South Plains northeastward into northwest TX
early this afternoon. Here, breezy southwesterly surface winds near
15 mph will develop amid a deeply-mixed boundary layer and 10-15
percent RH.

Over parts of northern NV, RAP forecast soundings indicate a
favorable environment for isolated dry thunderstorms this afternoon
-- characterized by a deep inverted-v profile, sufficient midlevel
moisture, and around 0.4 inch PW. However, generally unreceptive
fuels across the region should limit the risk of lightning-induced
ignitions -- precluding a Dry Thunder area.

For additional details, see the previous discussion below.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Sun May 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will translate eastward across the Southwest
today. A very dry airmass is in place across the Southwest with
single digit dewpoints across most of the region. However, winds
will be light beneath this ridge which should subdue fire weather
concerns for most of the Southwest. A cold front will move southward
across the Plains Sunday afternoon with strong winds expected in the
wake of this front. Some of these strong northeasterly winds may
overlap regions with low relative humidity in the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandles into southwest Kansas and far southwest Colorado. Some
critical conditions may occur across the northwest Texas Panhandle
and the western Oklahoma Panhandle. However, the area with the best
chance for 3 or more hours of these conditions will be very
isolated. Therefore, locally critical conditions are possible, but
more widespread critical conditions are not expected.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 15 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
20060529 - 19780528 - 19620430 - 20000509 - 19860513


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:
20000508 - 19620502 - 20060528 - 20070507 - 19860513

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
302 PM EDT Sun May 15 2022

Valid 12Z Wed May 18 2022 - 12Z Sun May 22 2022

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
by the weekend...


...Overview...

Upper troughing should shift out of the Northeast as the period
begins on Wednesday, with broad ridging to zonal flow behind
across the rest of the lower 48. The pattern is expected to
amplify later in the week as upper troughing digs in the West,
yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in a round
of precipitation spreading across the Northwest. Stubborn ridging
across the South will continue to promote unseasonably hot
weather, with the most persistent and record-breaking heat
centered in Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley. Warmer than
normal temperatures are forecast to spread into the East as the
ridge amplifies ahead of the trough in the West, but the heat
should finally break by next weekend across parts of the South.
Initially the best focus for showers and thunderstorms around
midweek will be over the Ohio Valley along a quasi-stationary
front, before precipitation spreads into the north-central U.S.
around Thursday and eastward late week. Flash flooding and severe
weather are both threats with this system. Shower/thunderstorm
chances will also increase in Florida late this week given
increasing tropical moisture.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains in good agreement for generally zonal flow
with a couple of embedded shortwaves across the lower 48 to start
the medium range period Wednesday, before amplification later this
week as troughing builds in the West creating ridging downstream.
The process for building this trough stems from potent energy
initially just offshore of British Columbia spilling into the
Northwest late Wednesday into Thursday and progressing eastward.
However, some notable differences remain regarding the splitting
of this energy into multiple features or more consolidation, as
well as variation with an embedded upper low being closed at
different points/times. Recent model guidance including some of
the 00Z runs and the newer 12Z runs have trended toward showing a
closed low around Friday, separate from but eventually interacting
with a farther north Hudson Bay upper low. Namely, the 00Z/12Z
ECMWF and UKMET indicated a closed low, while the 12Z GFS and CMC
trended toward this as well after more open earlier runs. 12Z runs
are thus showing better agreement for the surface low position as
well in the Upper Midwest day 5/Friday, so hopefully frontal
positions and QPF are following suit. The southern end of the
trough's progression remains somewhat uncertain as does the
eastern side by around Saturday, with the latter issue dependent
on interactions with that northern stream low. There has been a
gradual trend toward a slower trough and thus frontal progression
in the northeastern U.S. compared to previous forecasts. The 00Z
CMC appeared to be on the faster side. The updated WPC forecast
used a blend of the 00Z/06Z deterministic guidance early in the
period, transitioning toward a near even blend of the
GFS/ECMWF/GEFS mean/EC mean by the latter part of the period.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and rising heights
farther east over the Deep South will promote a broad area of heat
across much of the southern U.S. during the period. The greatest
and most lasting anomalies through the period should be over Texas
(persisting from the short range time frame) where some locations
could see highs up to 15-25F above normal, with numerous daily
record highs likely. Parts of the Southwest into the central Great
Basin and southern/central Rockies can expect highs around 10F
above average on Wednesday before a cooling trend as the deeper
troughing presses inland, which should help moderate temperatures
in Texas by the weekend. However, warm to hot temperatures are
also forecast for the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with
potential for daily record highs, and warmer than average
temperatures by 10-20F should expand in coverage across the Ohio
Valley to Eastern Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
the week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall, though
the specifics of coverage and amounts are uncertain, but at least
a localized flood threat is likely especially if heavy rain falls
in areas that are sensitive to additional rainfall. Then organized
rainfall, heavy at times, is likely along a frontal boundary
through the north-central U.S. around Thursday with potential for
at least localized flood and flash flood threats given wet
antecedent conditions across that region. Storms that could be
severe are forecast to shift from the Upper Midwest into parts of
the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys along this front Thursday into
Friday. Additionally, tropical moisture increasing across the
Florida peninsula late this week could lead to a more rainy
pattern for the Sunshine State.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

The Isolated Dry Thunderstorm area over the southern/central High
Plains was expanded slightly northward into northeastern CO -- where
a couple lightning-induced ignitions will be possible during the
afternoon/early evening time frame. Elsewhere, the previous forecast
(see below) remains on track.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Sun May 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will start to weaken on Monday as a series of weak
shortwave troughs move through the central Rockies. As a result,
weak lee cyclogenesis is anticipated in eastern Colorado. This
strengthening pressure gradient, combined with some deeper mixing
bringing stronger mid-level flow to the surface, should lead to 15
to 25 mph winds across portions of the Southwest and
southern/central High Plains. Some critical conditions appear
likely, but a more confined region where 20+ mph winds are
anticipated is not clear at this time.

A dryline will be in place across eastern Colorado and eastern New
Mexico on Monday which will separate single digit relative humidity
to the west from 20 to 25 percent relative humidity to the east.
Thunderstorms are likely along this dryline Monday afternoon in an
airmass with PWAT values at or below 0.8 inches. Therefore, any
storms which form will likely be drier. In addition, fuels in this
region are exceptionally dry which will further exacerbate fire
weather concerns from any dry thunderstorms.

...Severe weather and flash flooding potential across the Lower
Mississippi/Ohio Valley tonight to shift into the Northeast on
Monday...

...Next system to eject into the Great Plains on Tuesday to
produce another potential round of severe weather from the central
Plains to the Mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Summer-like and record breaking heat to persist across
Southwest and southern Plains through the beginning of the week...

Spring has kicked into full gear across the country, with daily
chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding as well as
widespread summer-like temperatures. A cold front progressing
across the Ohio Valley and into the southern Plains will trigger a
continuing severe weather threat into tonight. Thunderstorms will
be capable of producing damaging wind gusts, large hail, and
tornadoes from eastern Oklahoma to northern Arkansas and southern
Missouri. Torrential rain may also accompany the storms and lead
to isolated instances of flash flooding. A few thunderstorms could
turn severe farther east into the Ohio Valley as well. By Monday,
a rapidly strengthening low pressure system along the
aforementioned cold front will swing eastward and eventually into
the Interior Northeast. As it does so, a line of potentially
severe thunderstorms is expected to develop ahead of the
approaching cold front and impact parts of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic. Damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes are the
main concern, with large hail also possible. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe
thunderstorms from Upstate New York to northern Virginia.
Additionally, flash flooding may accompany any slow-moving
thunderstorms for this region, with a slightly more elevated heavy
rain threat located in northern New York and Vermont, where a
Slight Risk (level 2/4) for excessive rainfall has been issued.
The strong spring cold front will exit into the western Atlantic
by Monday night, ushering in comfortable temperatures and
increasingly tranquil conditions for the region on Tuesday.

The next system to impact the central U.S. will eject into the
Great Plains by Tuesday. Areas of low pressure forming in the lee
of the Rockies will slowly push eastward and interact with a
nearby stationary front to focus showers and thunderstorms across
the central Plains. SPC has issued an Slight Risk (level 2/5) of
severe thunderstorms across southern Nebraska, northern Kansas,
and into parts of Iowa and Missouri. Torrential downpours and
isolated chances for flash flooding may also accompany the storms.

Elsewhere, unsettled weather located across the Northwest could
spawn scattered severe thunderstorms throughout the Interior
Pacific Northwest tonight. Terrain susceptible to rapid runoff
will also be under the risk of flash flooding, which has prompted
Flood Watches to be issued. For the Southeast and Deep South, a
warm and muggy airmass ahead of the approaching cold front will
produce an environment conducive for scattered showers and
thunderstorms over the next few days, with most storms remaining
unorganized and short-lived. However, an isolated severe storm or
two cannot be ruled out.

Outside of the Northwest, Great Lakes, and Upper Midwest, above
average temperatures will be widespread over the next few days and
could reach into record territory for portions of the southern
tier. Highs into the upper 90s and triple digits are forecast
across the Desert Southwest and southern Plains through Tuesday.
Particularly for the Lone Star State, highs nearly 20 degrees
above average on Tuesday will have the potential to break several
daily high temperature records. The continuing early-season heat
can be dangerous is proper heat safety is not followed. Residents
are urged to stay hydrated and avoid strenuous outdoor activities
during peak heating hours.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 AM CDT Mon May 16 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel ridge will begin to weaken today as a series of
upper-level shortwave troughs move across parts of the
central/southern Rockies. A weak surface low is expected to develop
across the central High Plains, with a lee trough potentially
extending southward into parts of NM and west TX.

...Parts of NM/CO into the central/southern High Plains...
Gradually increasing low/midlevel flow will support sustained winds
of 15-20 mph (locally higher) across much of NM/west TX into
southern CO and parts of the High Plains. These winds, in
conjunction with RH dropping below 15% across NM/west TX, and
potentially into the 20-25% range across southeast CO/western KS,
will support elevated to locally critical fire-weather conditions.

High-based thunderstorms are expected to develop by late afternoon
from eastern NM into southeast CO. Some locally higher precipitation
amounts are possible with the strongest storms, but widespread
wetting rainfall is not expected, and the potential for lightning
activity amid very receptive fuels continues to merit an isolated
dry-thunderstorm delineation across this area. Gusty outflow winds
may become rather widespread by early evening across the area as
well.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF WEST INTO NORTHWEST TX...

...Synopsis...
A weak upper-level trough will remain in place across much of the
western CONUS on Tuesday, as multiple embedded shortwave troughs
move from the central/southern Rockies into the High Plains. A
surface low is forecast to deepen across southeast CO, with a
dryline expected to extend southward across portions of west TX.

...Parts of NM/west TX into the southern High Plains...
While the primary Pacific cold front/dryline may remain over west TX
during the afternoon, strong heating/mixing ahead of this feature
will result in the development of a secondary dryline further east
from southwest OK into central TX. The strongest low-level flow is
expected immediately to the west of this secondary dryline,
associated with a rather strong low-level jet. Areas from the TX
South Plains into the Big Country and Permian Basin may see
sustained winds of 20-25 mph as RH drops below 15%, resulting in
critical fire-weather conditions. Near-critical conditions may
extend into portions of southeast NM, though low-level flow is
currently expected to be somewhat weaker in this area.

In addition to the critical wind/RH threat, isolated high-based
thunderstorms will be possible across parts of the southern High
Plains during the late afternoon/evening, with very limited rainfall
potential, so an isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been included
for parts of this region.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
by the weekend...


...Overview...

A digging trough over the West and rising heights across the East
late this week will result in a more amplified pattern across the
lower 48 yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in
the West and a continued hot regime for the South and East. A
closed low across the northern tier Thursday-Friday and a strong
cold front shifting East will chances for heavy rainfall and
severe weather for some from the upper Mississippi Valley/Great
Lakes into the East. The upper trough will dig into the central
and eastern U.S. next weekend as height rise again out West.
Tropical moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances
across Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance has trended stronger with a closed low across the
northern High Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley Thursday
and Friday, but show relatively good agreement on this feature,
with mainly just some minor timing differences as the low lifts
into central Canada and the amplified trough slides into the Ohio
Valley/Northeast on Saturday. For the first half of the period, a
general model compromise worked well. After this, model guidance
begins to show much more uncertainty surrounding a couple of
shortwaves through the West Sunday/Monday. The ECMWF is stronger
with an initial shortwave dropping down behind the eastern trough
tending to amplify this feature more than the other guidance
resulting in a stronger ridge over the West. Meanwhile, the GFS
and the CMC are weaker with this first shortwave which allows for
a weakness to round the top of a Pacific upper high and slide into
the West. The WPC blend trended towards the ensemble means which
seemed to side more with the GFS and CMC vs the ECMWF, but still
incorporated some minor amounts of the ECMWF and GFS for added
flow definition.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and rising heights
farther east over the Deep South will continue to promote a broad
area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the period.
The greatest and most lasting anomalies through the period should
be over Texas (persisting from the short range time frame) where
some locations could see highs up to 15-25F above normal, with
numerous daily record highs likely. The heat across Texas should
finally begin to moderate by next weekend as troughing presses
through the West. However, warm to hot temperatures are also
forecast for the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
the week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall, though
the specifics of coverage and amounts are uncertain, but at least
a localized flood threat is likely especially if heavy rain falls
in areas that are sensitive to additional rainfall. Then organized
rainfall, heavy at times, is likely along a frontal boundary
through the north-central U.S. around Thursday with potential for
at least localized flood and flash flood threats given wet
antecedent conditions across that region. Storms that could be
severe are forecast to shift from the Upper Midwest into parts of
the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys along this front Thursday into
Friday. Additionally, tropical moisture increasing across the
Florida peninsula late this week could lead to a more rainy
pattern for the Sunshine State.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

into central Canada and the amplified trough slides into the Ohio
Valley/Northeast on Saturday. For the first half of the period, a
general model compromise worked well. After this, model guidance
begins to show much more uncertainty surrounding a couple of
shortwaves through the West Sunday/Monday. The ECMWF is stronger
with an initial shortwave dropping down behind the eastern trough
tending to amplify this feature more than the other guidance
resulting in a stronger ridge over the West. Meanwhile, the GFS
and the CMC are weaker with this first shortwave which allows for
a weakness to round the top of a Pacific upper high and slide into
the West. The WPC blend trended towards the ensemble means which
seemed to side more with the GFS and CMC vs the ECMWF, but still
incorporated some minor amounts of the ECMWF and GFS for added
flow definition.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the southern Plains and rising heights
farther east over the Deep South will continue to promote a broad
area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the period.
The greatest and most lasting anomalies through the period should
be over Texas (persisting from the short range time frame) where
some locations could see highs up to 15-25F above normal, with
numerous daily record highs likely. The heat across Texas should
finally begin to moderate by next weekend as troughing presses
through the West. However, warm to hot temperatures are also
forecast for the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide a focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
the week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall, though
the specifics of coverage and amounts are uncertain, but at least
a localized flood threat is likely especially if heavy rain falls
in areas that are sensitive to additional rainfall. Then organized
rainfall, heavy at times, is likely along a frontal boundary
through the north-central U.S. around Thursday with potential for
at least localized flood and flash flood threats given wet
antecedent conditions across that region. Storms that could be
severe are forecast to shift from the Upper Midwest into parts of
the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys along this front Thursday into
Friday. Additionally, tropical moisture increasing across the
Florida peninsula late this week could lead to a more rainy
pattern for the Sunshine State.

After a couple of initial fronts crossing the Northwest, the main
well-defined front ahead of the deepening trough will bring
unseasonably cool temperatures to the Northwest and expanding into
the northern Rockies and High Plains by late week. This will also
provide support for a notable round of precipitation, with
lowering snow levels in the Cascades to Northern Rockies as the
week progresses, with some chance of snow even into northern parts
of the High Plains, though with very low confidence at this point.

...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. through this week with anomalous heat expanding into the East
this weekend...

...Heavy rainfall and flash flooding possible along a strong cold
front across the northern tier on Thursday...


...Overview...

A digging trough over the West and rising heights across the East
late this week will result in a more amplified pattern across the
lower 48 yielding cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in
the West and a continued hot regime for the South and East. A
closed low across the northern tier Thursday-Friday and a strong
cold front shifting East will chances for heavy rainfall and
severe weather for some from the upper Mississippi Valley/Great
Lakes into the East. The upper trough will dig into the central
and eastern U.S. next weekend as height rise again out West.
Tropical moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances
across Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance has trended stronger with a closed low across the
northern High Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley Thursday
and Friday, but show relatively good agreement on this feature,
with mainly just some minor timing differences as the low lifts
into central Canada and the amplified trough slides into the Ohio
Valley/Northeast on Saturday. For the first half of the period, a
general model compromise worked well. After this, model guidance
begins to show much more uncertainty surrounding a couple of
shortwaves through the West Sunday/Monday. The ECMWF is stronger
with an initial shortwave dropping down behind the eastern trough
tending to amplify this feature more than the other guidance
resulting in a stronger ridge over the West. Meanwhile, the GFS
and the CMC are weaker with this first shortwave which allows for
a weakness to round the top of a Pacific upper high and slide into
the West. The WPC blend trended towards the ensemble means which
seemed to side more with the GFS and CMC vs the ECMWF, but still
incorporated some minor amounts of the ECMWF and GFS for added
flow definition.

forecast for the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. with potential
for daily record highs, and warmer than average temperatures by
10-20F should expand in coverage across the Ohio Valley to Eastern
Seaboard by later in the week.

A warm front lifting through the Ohio Valley/Appalachians on
Thursday will continue to provide a focus for showers and storms
on Thursday, with a very localized flood threat particularly if
heavy rainfall falls in areas that are already sensitive.
Meanwhile, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is likely along a
strong cold front through the northern tier on Thursday, with
potential for flood and flash flooding given very wet antecedent
conditions across that region. Above average moisture and
instability will allow for precipitation to spread along the
frontal boundary as it pushes through the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
on Friday and into the East on Saturday. Locally heavy rainfall is
possible. The Storm Prediction Center highlights a threat for
severe weather as well across these same regions along and ahead
of the cold front Thursday and Friday. Behind this front,
unseasonably cool temperatures will slide across the
Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday into the north-central U.S.
Friday and Saturday. This is expected to lower snow levels
allowing for some light snow to fall even in northern parts of the
High Plains. Elsewhere, tropical moisture increasing across the
Florida peninsula late this week may bring a round of heavy
rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State while parts of the
West, central Great Basin, and Southwest may again warm up
underneath riding moving back into the region.

...Severe weather and flash flooding concerns shift to the East
today...

...Record warm temperatures in the South this week...

...Fire weather risk for parts of the Southwest and Southern
Plains...

Showers and thunderstorms are forecast to spread into the East
today along a cold front. Some thunderstorms in the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast, where Slight Risks (level 2/5) are in effect, may
be severe. Hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes will be the
primary threats from any severe thunderstorms, especially within
the Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) area, extending from eastern New
York into northern Virginia. Heavy rainfall may develop over parts
of the interior Northeast. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is
in effect over northeastern New York and much of Vermont as a
result. Additional severe thunderstorms are expected to move
across eastern New Mexico into the Texas Panhandle this afternoon
with the threat of large hail and severe wind gusts.

Attention shifts westward on Tuesday as a new system emerges over
the Plains. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect
over parts of the Central Plains and Missouri Valley where large
hail and damaging winds will be the primary threats. Additionally,
there's a marginal risk of heavy rainfall developing over parts of
the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley as shortwave energy rotates
through the region and a quasi-stationary front stalls out.

Upper-level ridging over the Southwest and Southern Plains will
lead to a prolonged heat wave for much of the South over the next
several days. Widespread temperature records are forecast to be
tied or broken in the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
through mid-week before parts of the Southeast get in on the
record breaking action late this week. High temperatures will be
in the 90s and 100s for consecutive days across much of Texas
which will pose a threat to those who are sensitive to heat or
have poor air ventilation where they reside. Cold air begins to
spill into the Northwest behind a powerful cold front beginning on
Wednesday.

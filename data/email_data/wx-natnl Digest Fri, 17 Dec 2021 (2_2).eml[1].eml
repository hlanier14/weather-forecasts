...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The majority of guidance suggests that an amplified mean trough
aloft over the far eastern Pacific will be the dominant feature
during the period, bringing multiple days of precipitation to
parts of the West Coast states with lesser amounts farther inland.
 To the east a southern stream shortwave tracking eastward from
the southern Plains Monday onward will support a western Gulf into
eastern Atlantic system spreading rain across the Gulf Coast and
Southeast.  Expect mostly light precipitation with one or more
northern tier waves/fronts carried along by the progressive mean
flow.  The large scale pattern will likely favor well above normal
temperatures over parts of the central/southern Plains but below
normal temperatures over the extreme northern Plains.

For about the first half of the period a composite of 12Z/18Z
operational models represented the most common ideas of guidance,
though lingering uncertainties exist in multiple places.  Latest
solutions have adjusted a bit faster than previous forecast for
the southern tier system while the models are still in the process
of resolving specifics of a couple shortwaves within the southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. stream.  There is decent agreement in
principle for the upper low off the West Coast, with latest trends
adjusting the feature a little more offshore corresponding with
the upper ridge over the Northwest/Interior West being stronger.

Around midweek a strong bundle of energy diving south from Alaska
begins to add to the forecast complexity, with recent individual
model runs and ensemble members showing considerable spread for
what happens.  Possibilities include this energy merging with the
initial upper low, forming a new upper low while ejecting energy
from the initial low eastward, or itself becoming a mere
progressive shortwave while the first upper low remains offshore
(12Z and new 00Z ECMWF).  Latest ensemble means have been
providing a good middle ground among these various options,
keeping an upper trough axis close to the West Coast into day 7
Friday--a reasonable idea based on teleconnections relative to the
upstream ridge's positive height anomaly.  Thus the forecast
transitioned toward about half ensemble means (18Z GEFS/12Z ECens)
while splitting the lingering GFS input between its 12Z/18Z runs
and eventually switching ECMWF input to the 00Z/16 run that was
slower with the West Coast trough (and keeping a little 12Z CMC).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The upper low initially offshore the West Coast and then digging
trough energy from Alaska should provide favorable ingredients for
periods of moderate to heavy precipitation over portions of the
West Coast states with lesser amounts extending inland through the
Great Basin and Rockies.  Currently northern and central
California have the best potential for seeing the highest five-day
totals, aided by slow motion of the initial offshore system, a
developing moisture plume, and favored southern/western facing
terrain enhancement.  Some guidance shows sufficiently heavy
rainfall at lower elevations that there could be some local
runoff/flooding issues while snow would be heavy over Sierra
Nevada/Shasta areas.  Confidence in the details of coverage and
intensity of precipitation after midweek decreases though.

Elsewhere, low pressure tracking from the western Gulf of Mexico
through Florida and into the Atlantic will spread rain across
portions of the South/Southeast.  Some locations over the
Southeast/Florida could see moderate to locally heavy rainfall but
there is still a fair amount of uncertainty for intensity at any
particular location as well as the northward extent of moisture.
One or more northern tier waves/fronts may spread mostly light
snow from the extreme northern Plains through the Great Lakes and
New England.

Upper ridging over the west-central U.S. will support persistently
warm temperatures over the southern two-thirds of the Plains next
week.  Expect the coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs to
expand during the first half of the week and remain broad through
Friday.  A few locations may see highs even greater than 20F above
normal.  On the other hand the extreme northern Plains should see
below normal temperatures.  Monday should be the coldest day with
highs 10-15F or so below normal over parts of Montana and North
Dakota.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CST Fri Dec 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning
over the central Great Basin is forecast to move eastward across the
central Rockies/Plains today.  At the surface, a lee trough is
expected to move eastward from the High Plains in the morning
followed by a cold front surging southward through the central
Plains during the evening hours.

...Portions of Northwestern Kansas, Southwestern Nebraska, and
Northeastern Colorado...
Despite relatively cool temperatures (highs only approaching 50 F)
across the region, dry and breezy conditions in the midst of dry
fuels (ERC values exceeding 90th percentile) should result in
elevated fire weather conditions.  Sustained afternoon northwesterly
surface winds are expected to approach 20 mph as enhanced flow aloft
is transferred downward through boundary-layer mixing.
Concurrently, afternoon RH values are expected to fall below 20%
given the very dry airmass.  Fire-weather conditions are expected to
improve by late afternoon as cooling and moistening occurs with the
cold-frontal passage.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue moving eastward across the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes Region on Saturday.  At the
surface, a low-pressure system will move northeastward from the Ohio
Valley toward the Northeast.  An associated cold front will push
eastward toward the Appalachians and southward through the southern
Plains by the evening.

In the wake of the cold-frontal passage across the southern Plains,
conditions will be cold, dry, and breezy.  Even with high
temperatures only in the 40s, RH values will still fall below 20%
from southwestern Kansas into northwestern Texas.  The best overlap
of low RH and sustained north-northeasterly surface winds over 15
mph is currently forecast to occur south of driest fuels, so no
fire-weather highlights are included at this time.

...Heavy rain and potentially severe thunderstorms near a
meandering front expected from the southern Plains to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley through Saturday morning...

...Moderate to heavy snow across northern New England later this
weekend with freezing rain over central New England...

...Showers and thunderstorms will gradually move across the Deep
South and into the East Coast during the weekend ahead of a cold
front...

The trailing cold front associated with a deep low pressure system
moving farther away into eastern Canada is forecast to meander
across the Mid-South today.  Ample moisture returning from the
Gulf of Mexico will be lifted along the front resulting in an axis
of enhanced rainfall to extend eastward through the Tennessee
Valley today where areas of heavy rain could result in flooding
issues.  In addition, instability will enhance the possibility of
severe thunderstorms to occur across portions of the southern
Plains today as a low pressure wave develops along the the
meandering front.  The front is forecast to begin moving more
steadily toward the east later tonight, pushing the rain and
thunderstorms eastward across the Deep South on Saturday and into
the East Coast Saturday night into Sunday morning.  Meanwhile, the
low pressure wave is forecast to intensify as it tracks across the
Ohio Valley on Saturday and then slide off the New England coast
early on Sunday.  With cold air in place across the Northeast,
moderate to heavy snow is forecast to spread from west to east
from upstate New York eastward through northern New England later
this weekend while a swath of freezing rain can be expected
farther south across central New England.  Well above average
temperatures from the Southern Plains to the Northeast will
gradually return to seasonal levels behind the cold front.

In the Southern High Plains modestly dry and breezy conditions are
forecast to persist over extremely dry fuels through Friday
morning, while similar conditions are expected to arise Friday
morning to Saturday morning over the Central High Plains. Given
the fact these conditions are conducive to fire spread, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather for
the Southern High Plains through tomorrow morning and the Central
High Plains Friday morning through Saturday morning. Red Flag
warnings are currently in effect for portions of southeast
Colorado.

Elsewhere, a stationary boundary meandering through the Northern
and Central Rockies will support heavy snowfall over the regions'
high elevation mountain ranges through Friday morning. The
eastward progression of shortwave instability at the surface will
guide this snowfall out of the mountains and into the Northern
Plains on Friday where light to moderate accumulations are
expected. In the Pacific Northwest, a system moving onshore
Saturday is forecast to bring rainfall to the coast and low
elevation areas, while heavy snow is expected over Olympics and
northern Washington Cascades before spreading east into the
Northern Rockies Saturday evening.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably warm record-breaking weather is
forecast to persist from the Southern Plains to the Northeast into
the weekend. With today's daily highs sitting 20 to 30 degrees
above normal, 56 daily high temperature records throughout the
eastern half of the country have already fallen. A handful of
tomorrow and Saturday's daily high temperature records will also
be put to the test as highs are forecast to reach a modest 10 to
20 degrees above normal. In stark contrast to the east,
temperatures out west have dropped moderately to 5 to 10 degrees
below normal. An even larger departure from normal is expected
over the Northern High Plains, where daily highs could drop to as
low as 20 degrees below normal on Friday.

...Showers and thunderstorms will gradually move across the Deep
South and into the East Coast during the weekend ahead of a cold
front...

The trailing cold front associated with a deep low pressure system
moving farther away into eastern Canada is forecast to meander
across the Mid-South today.  Ample moisture returning from the
Gulf of Mexico will be lifted along the front resulting in an axis
of enhanced rainfall to extend eastward from the southern Plains
through the Tennessee Valley today.  Areas of heavy rain together
with the possibility of severe thunderstorms could result in
flooding issues today across these areas as a low pressure wave
develops along the meandering front.  The front is forecast to
begin moving more steadily toward the east later tonight, pushing
the rain and thunderstorms eastward across the Deep South on
Saturday and into the East Coast Saturday night into Sunday
morning.  Meanwhile, the low pressure wave is forecast to
intensify as it tracks across the Ohio Valley on Saturday and then
slides off the New England coast early on Sunday.  With cold air
in place across the Northeast, moderate to heavy snow is forecast
to spread from west to east from upstate New York eastward through
northern New England later this weekend while a swath of freezing
rain can be expected farther south across central New England.
Farther to the south, well above average temperatures from the
Deep South to the East Coast will gradually return to seasonal
levels behind the cold front.

After a break in the precipitation today across the Pacific
Northwest, moisture from the next Pacific system is forecast to
arrive on Saturday.  Moderate to heavy rain near the coast along
with mountain snows will once again overspread the region
throughout the weekend.  Over the northern Rockies, an Alberta
clipper dipping toward the southeast will bring a round of modest
snowfall followed by a strong and gusty cold wind from the north
and northwest across the northern Rockies into the northern to
central High Plains today.  The clipper will then dissipate as it
merges with the intensifying low pressure wave over the Ohio
Valley on Saturday.  By Saturday night, another Alberta clipper is
forecast to form as snow lingers across western Montana into
northern Idaho.

Elsewhere, modestly dry and breezy conditions promoted by
downslope winds will allow elevated fire risk to continue today in
the central High Plains.

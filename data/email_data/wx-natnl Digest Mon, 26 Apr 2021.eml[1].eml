Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CDT Sun Apr 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN...THE
FOUR CORNERS REGION...AND THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected this
afternoon into this evening across a large portion of the
Southwestern United States.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
Surface analysis as of 1550Z shows pockets of elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions already ongoing across portions of
New Mexico, with sustained surface winds of 10-25 mph and RH values
near 15-25%. Widespread critical fire weather conditions are
forecast to develop by midday as diurnal mixing strengthens surface
winds and promotes low-level drying. Sustained surface winds of
20-30 mph (with 30-40+ mph wind gusts) and minimum RH values of
5-15% are likely for several hours this afternoon into the evening.

Primary change with this forecast was to expand the Critical fire
weather area along its northeastern/eastern fringes in portions of
southeast Colorado, far southwest Kansas, and the Texas Panhandle,
since the expectation is that most guidance is likely
underforecasting the extent/magnitude of low-level drying as is
often the case in these types of events.

Poor overnight RH recoveries and lingering breeziness are expected
again tonight, which will maintain at least a locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the overnight across much of the southern
High Plains.

...Great Basin/Four Corners...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected from midday into the
evening from southern Nevada into the Four Corners region as
sustained surface winds of 20-35 mph (with stronger gusts)
overspread minimum RH values of 10-20%.

Primary change with this forecast update was to extend the
Critical/Elevated fire weather areas over eastern Utah and western
Colorado farther northeastward, as the latest guidance shows drier
air penetrating farther into this area.

Poor RH recoveries and lingering breeziness over eastern Utah and
western Colorado will maintain at least locally elevated fire
weather conditions in these areas through the overnight.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information
regarding today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 04/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CDT Sun Apr 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows continued zonal flow over
the northern/central Rockies with a deepening upper-level low off
the Pacific Northwest coast. This low is forecast to gradually
deepen along the West Coast through the day while zonal flow is
maintained over the Rockies. As a result, surface pressure falls are
expected across eastern ID into central/eastern WY.  Surface winds
across the Southwest and High Plains are forecast to strengthen in
response, and will introduce fire weather concerns given dry
antecedent conditions and receptive fuels.

...Great Basin/Four Corners...
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely again today from
southern NV into the Four Corners region. Southwesterly flow off the
desert terrain of southern CA will limit any moisture return into
the region, and recent VWP observations from southern NV and
southern UT show 30-40 mph winds within the lowest 2-3 km. These
winds will remain in place as an mid-level jet develops over the
region. Despite some high-level cloud cover, diurnal heating will
help these stronger winds mix down by mid to late afternoon. This
will also support RH reductions into the low teens for most of the
region. Overall, similar wind/RH conditions are expected today as
compared to Saturday, but the coverage of 20+ mph surface winds will
likely be more widespread given the stronger pressure falls and
better upper-level wind support.

...Southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely for much of NM into
the western Panhandles region. A lee trough, noted in recent surface
pressure analyses, will continue to deepen and support widespread 20
mph winds across the central and southern High Plains this
afternoon. Recent observations from the KAMA, KDDC, and KGLD VWPs
show a strong nocturnal jet in place over the region with 50-70 mph
winds just above the surface. Although this jet is expected to
weaken through the day, diurnal boundary-layer mixing will
facilitate downward transport of the stronger winds aloft and
support widespread wind gusts into the 30-40 mph range. Despite
modest moisture return into the region early this morning,
southwesterly flow off the southern Rockies will drive downslope
warming and drying to yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens from central NM into the Panhandles. Fuels across the southern
High Plains are undergoing green-up with improving fuel moisture
with eastward extent. So while elevated to critical wind/RH
conditions may be fairly widespread, the greatest fire weather risk
will be confined to NM and the far western Panhandles were grassy
fuels are generally drier.

0118 PM CDT Sun Apr 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS AND
SOUTHERN ROCKIES...

...Southern/Central Plains and Southern Rockies...
Poor overnight RH recoveries coupled with lingering breeziness will
likely foster elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
tomorrow morning (Day 2/Monday) over portions of the
southern/central High Plains.

Widespread critical fire weather conditions are likely to develop by
midday across portions of northeastern/southeastern Arizona, nearly
all of New Mexico, southeast Colorado, southwestern Kansas, and
portions of the Texas Panhandle. Sustained surface wind speeds of
20-30 mph (stronger gusts) and minimum RH values below 15% are
likely for several hours into the evening. Pockets of sustained
winds exceeding 30 mph are also possible during the afternoon and
evening.

Less certain is the extent/magnitude of the critical/elevated fire
weather conditions across northeastern Colorado, northwestern
Kansas, and Nebraska. The HRRR/FV3 are the most aggressive (as is
usually the case for High Plains events) with forecasted critical
weather conditions extending northward into much of Nebraska, while
the other HREF members suggest elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions are more likely. HRRR/FV3 may be a bit overdone,
but are likely closer to the truth based on past performance in High
Plains events. Thus, have extended the Elevated/Critical areas
farther northward into the central Plains. Portions of this Elevated
area will be monitored closely for a possible upgrade to Critical in
future outlooks.

Please see previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Sun Apr 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest, is forecast to deepen and shift east/southeast into the
Southwest through Monday. As this occurs, a surface lee trough will
consolidate into a low over eastern CO by Monday afternoon.
Strengthening mid and upper-level flow will begin to overspread the
NM/TX region and support the potential for strong winds. Given
antecedent dry conditions, this will introduce widespread critical
fire weather concerns to the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities for
widespread 20+ mph surface winds across NM and into adjacent regions
of TX, OK, CO, and KS as winds increase in response to the deepening
surface low. Southwesterly downslope winds and strong diurnal
heating will help mix a dryline east into the eastern OK/TX
Panhandles and allow for widespread relative humidity values in the
single digits to low teens. Strong mid-level flow within a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer should allow for widespread wind gusts
between 30-40 mph. Widespread critical wind/RH conditions will
likely be met across the broader southern High Plains region;
however, spring green-up may limit the spatial extent of receptive
fuels. Fuels will be most favorable across NM and into the far
western Panhandles, but will become less receptive with eastern and
northern extent. An expansion of both the elevated and critical risk
areas may be needed if fuel guidance trends drier across the eastern
OK/TX Panhandles and western KS.

...Central High Plains...
West to southwest downslope winds off the central Rockies are
expected to overspread eastern WY and into western NE Monday
afternoon. Sustained winds between 20-25 mph appear probable, and
more aggressive guidance suggests RH reductions to 15-20% are
possible. Consequently, elevated to critical fire weather conditions
may develop by the late afternoon hours. However, ERC values near
the 50th percentile and 10-hour fuel moisture values between 5-10%
suggests fuels may not be as receptive as compared to locations
further south. As mentioned in the southern High Plains section, a
risk area may be introduced in subsequent updates pending fuel
trends.

...Northeast...
The latest fuel guidance indicates that fine fuels across portions
of the northeast are receptive with ERC values near or above the
90th percentile and 10-hour fuel moisture near 5%. Dry and breezy
conditions are possible on Monday afternoon in the wake of a
departing surface low to the east. Relative humidity values in the
25-35% range may coincide with 10-15 mph winds across central PA and
into eastern NY. However, this region is also receiving wetting
rainfall early Sunday morning, which may mitigate any fuel
readiness. Trends will continue to be monitored given the prior
state of the fuels and the potential for elevated wind/RH conditions
on Monday.

...Heavy rain threat from the Southern Plains into the Middle
Mississippi Valley around midweek...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

At least in the 00Z/06Z cycles there was momentary agreement on
what was recently an emerging trend toward more progressive
northern stream flow amplifying into the Northeast (with
developing late week/weekend New England into Canadian Maritimes
low pressure) and corresponding slower trend for an upper low that
may drift from the U.S.-Mexico border into the far southern
Plains/Gulf Coast region. Aside from typical spread and
variability for forecasts several days out in time, guidance has
been more stable with the upstream pattern that features a strong
upper ridge building over the West after midweek followed by
weakening/progression of the ridge as a Pacific shortwave arrives
by next Sunday.

A composite of the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET depicted the
consensus for significant features in the updated forecast from
day 3 Wednesday into day 5 Friday. Given the expected location of
the southern upper low as of late week and recent trends for
northern stream flow, preference remained with the GFS/ECMWF/CMC
runs through next weekend in order to maintain reasonable
definition--with the understanding of persistent uncertainty as
seen in the ensemble spread. The operational model blend ended up
close to the ensemble means for the upper trough reaching the West
late in the period.

Perhaps not surprising given recent history, new 12Z guidance is
back to offering widely divergent solutions. The UKMET becomes
slow and deep with upper troughing that amplifies into the Upper
Midwest and Great Lakes as well as more progressive with the
southern tier upper low, returning to a phased solution for which
the GFS had been the last holdout before the 00Z run. The UKMET
also becomes quite flat and progressive with eastern Pacific
shortwave energy late in its run. The ECMWF has also jumped faster
with the southern tier low and by the end of the period uses later
northern stream energy to phase with the southern feature. On the
other hand the CMC has held onto an evolution close to the 00Z
CMC/ECMWF for most features while the GFS has nudged a little
faster for the southern tier upper low but is still a member of
the slower cluster.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Early in the period the forecast is fairly consistent in depicting
a heavy rainfall event that should already be in progress as of
early Wednesday from parts of Texas and Oklahoma into the Middle
Mississippi Valley, as Gulf moisture interacts with a wavy surface
front initially extending from the Great Lakes into western Texas.
Slow movement of the wavy front around midweek could allow for
training of convection and an increased flood risk. Continue to
check Storm Prediction Center outlooks for the latest information
on severe weather potential. The ultimate evolution and
progression of this precipitation area after early Thursday is
still very uncertain in light of new guidance diverging once again
after models had reached a momentary consensus in the prior cycle.
There is still a wide range of possible outcomes, from locally
enhanced rainfall settling over Texas and the central Gulf Coast
region to faster progression and a drier trend over the Plains.
Either way some of the initial moisture should extend into parts
of the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Northeast with some meaningful
totals possible.

Most of the Northwest will be dry Wednesday-Thursday as the best
flow of moisture focuses on western British Columbia/Vancouver
island, with light amounts of precipitation possibly extending
into the Olympics and vicinity. The approach/arrival of the
Pacific shortwave and leading front will spread mostly light to
moderate precipitation from the Pacific Northwest into northern
Rockies late this week into the weekend.

The strong upper ridge building into the West after midweek will
bring a brief period of much above normal temperatures to the
region. Parts of northern California and Oregon may see highs
reach 10-20F above normal already on Wednesday and a majority of
the West should see such anomalies (with localized readings 20-25F
above normal possible) from Thursday into Saturday. Some locations
may reach daily records for highs/warm lows. The approaching
Pacific trough aloft and leading cold front will bring a
pronounced cooling trend from the Pacific Northwest
eastward/southward by next weekend, possibly bringing highs down
to slightly below normal over northern areas by Sunday. The
western warmth will extend into the northern half of so of the
Plains by Friday-Saturday with highs 10-20F or so above normal,
and sagging into the Midwest/central Plains on Sunday as a front
approaches. Farther south, the upper low forecast to drift near
the U.S.-Mexico border will lead to cool daytime highs of 10-20F
below normal for one or more days over parts of the southern
Rockies/High Plains. Expect above to well above normal
temperatures from Wednesday into early Friday ahead of a wavy
front from the Northeast/Great Lakes into southern High Plains
early Wednesday and pushing southeastward through late week.
Warmest anomalies of plus 10-20F for highs, and perhaps locally a
bit higher for morning lows, should extend from the southern
Midwest through the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic. Frontal passage will likely bring near to slightly
below normal temperatures over the East into the weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 25 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Valid 00Z Mon Apr 26 2021 - 00Z Wed Apr 28 2021

...Rain and snow are likely across much of the West, winding down
Tuesday...

...Widespread fire danger remains a concern for the southwestern
quadrant of the U.S. through Monday...

An upper-level trough coming into the West, along with multiple
pieces of upper-level energy and reinforcing cold fronts making
their way through the region, will continue to cause precipitation
and colder than average temperatures across the West over the next
couple of days. Lower elevation rain and higher elevation snow are
expected to slowly shift southeastward from the Northwest and
Central Great Basin tonight into the Southwest on Monday and the
Central/Southern Rockies on Tuesday. The snow event is ongoing in
the Sierra Nevada, with additional snow likely there, and Winter
Storm Warnings remain in effect. Higher elevations of the
Intermountain West could also see several inches of snow,
especially in the Wind River Mountains/Tetons. Then snow should
increase in the Central Rockies by Tuesday as precipitation winds
down in the Northwest.

Additionally, precipitation is expected across the north-central
U.S. north of a sharp warm front. Light mixed precipitation and
snow are possible through Monday morning in northern Minnesota,
Wisconsin, and Michigan in the cool temperatures. South of the
warm front, high temperatures that are above average by 10 to 20
degrees are forecast for much of the central U.S. Monday, shifting
toward the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley and the Eastern Seaboard by
Tuesday.

Elsewhere, light rain showers possibly changing to snow showers
are possible in northern New England through Monday given a couple
of low pressure systems in the vicinity. Rain and thunderstorms
are expected to increase in the south-central U.S. on Tuesday as
the cold front and trough move eastward from the West, and severe
weather and flash flooding are both possibilities, so stay tuned
for updates.

Dry and windy conditions are persistent across the Desert
Southwest into the Central Great Basin, Southern Rockies, and
Southern High Plains ahead of the trough, leading to continued
fire weather concerns. Widespread Red Flag Warnings are in effect
for those areas through this evening, along with a Critical Risk
of fire danger from the Storm Prediction Center. Some light
precipitation and cooler temperatures in portions of the Southwest
should positively affect that region on Monday, but another day of
fire danger is expected for eastern Arizona across New Mexico and
into central/southern portions of the High Plains, where there is
another Critical Risk outlooked.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AND THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level wave
deepening along/just off the California coast. Enhanced mid and
upper-level winds continue to shift from the Great Basin into the
Four Corners region ahead of the wave. At the surface, a broad
surface low currently over central and eastern WY will begin to
consolidate to the south across eastern CO this afternoon amid
increasing pressure falls. In response, surface winds will
strengthen across the Four Corners and southern High Plains region.
Ongoing drought conditions and recent days of very dry and windy
conditions have maintained receptive fuels across the region, which
will support another day of widespread fire weather concerns.

...Four Corners and the Southern High Plains...
Widespread critical conditions appear likely again today across most
of NM and into western KS. Recent surface observations from west TX
into the Four Corners region show poor overnight relative humidity
recovery as RH values struggle to climb out of the teens and low
20s. Although modest moisture return is possible across west TX
through noon, widespread single-digit to low teen RH values will
overspread the region again as the dryline mixes east in response to
the deepening surface low. The strengthening pressure gradient
across the region will support widespread sustained winds near 25
mph, though a few locations may see periods of 30 mph sustained
winds. Strong diurnal heating will drive deep boundary-layer mixing
by mid to late afternoon, which will support downward transfer of
35-45 mph winds. Mid and high-level cloud cover from southern NV
into eastern UT and southern WY, as well as an approaching cold
front from the west, introduce some uncertainty into the RH forecast
for this region, but strong winds between 20-25 mph appear likely.

...Central High Plains...
Guidance has come into better agreement regarding the potential for
elevated, to locally critical, fire weather conditions and westerly
downslope winds increase this afternoon. Fuel guidance trends across
this region suggest that fine fuels are in the process of drying out
in the lower elevations, and should support at least some fire
concern. Although elevated to critical wind/RH combinations are
possible further west, improving fuel conditions introduce
uncertainty in the fire weather potential.

...Northeast...
CoCoRaHs reports from the past 24 hours show 0.1 to 0.35 inches of
rainfall have fallen along the Northeast coast. While this has
helped mitigate fuel receptiveness to some degree, locations further
inland received less rainfall and likely still have receptive fuels.
Breezy northwesterly winds will usher in drier air from southeast
Ontario/Quebec through the day and support RH reductions down to
30-35%. Consequently, areas of elevated fire weather conditions are
possible across portions of MA, VT, and NH. This threat is expected
to be relatively localized, but a broader risk area may be
introduced in future updates if observations trend drier than
currently expected.

...Heavy rain threat Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys and
Central Gulf Coast mid-later week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The larger scale pattern evolution is reasonably well represented
by guidance despite split flow and uncertain progression days 3-7.
However, recent models and ensembles have been offering much less
than stellar run to run continuity through medium range time
scales with the timing and interactions of small to mid scale
systems in both the northern and southern stream flows. This has
led to erratic system trends often contrary to a particular known
bias of a given guidance source. Slower solutions are consistent
with initially amplified ridging over the West Coast, but embedded
system wavelength spacing and stream interactions tends to favor
progression. Given uncertainty and with an eye toward best
possible WPC product continuity, opted to take a middle of the
road approach with a blend of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and 12 UTC
ECMWF ensemble mean that are near the center of the full envelope
of recent model solutions. Newer 00 UTC guidance does not show a
strong common trend with the GFS/GEFS faster, the ECMWF/UKMET
slower and with only a modest change from the Canadian.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A heavy rainfall event is expected to already be in progress by
Thursday from eastern TX to the Lower MS/TN Valleys as Gulf
moisture and instability pools near a wavy surface front, albeit
with uncertain main southern stream upper trough approach. There
is still a wide range of possible outcomes in guidance, from
locally enhanced rainfall settling longer over Texas and the
central Gulf Coast region to a faster progression across The South
with a drier trend over the Plains.

Most of the Northwest will be dry Thursday as the best flow of
moisture focuses on western British Columbia/Vancouver island,
with light amounts of precipitation extending into the Olympics.
The approach/arrival of a Pacific shortwave and leading front will
spread mostly light to moderate precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest into northern Rockies late this week through the weekend.

The strong upper ridge building into the West past midweek will
spread much above normal temperatures with 15-20+F above normal
anomalies Thursday into Saturday across much of the West and High
Plains. Some locations may reach daily records for highs/warm
lows. The approaching Pacific trough aloft and leading cold front
will start a pronounced cooling trend back toward climatology by
next weekend.

0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently residing off the California coast
is forecast to deepen over Baja California by early Tuesday. Strong
southwesterly mid and upper-level flow is forecast to remain in
place from northern Mexico into the central Plains through the day,
and there are some indications in recent guidance that an embedded
impulse could bring a period of enhanced flow during the day. Broad
synoptic ascent will help anchor a surface low across southeast CO,
which will support another day of strong pressure-gradient winds at
the surface. While precipitation chances will generally increase
across the region, a narrow corridor along the southern High Plains
will likely remain dry and see elevated to critical fire weather
conditions.

...Southern High Plains...
Although recent guidance has come into somewhat better agreement
regarding the timing and placement of the main synoptic features,
regional details remain uncertain. Confidence is reasonably high in
widespread sustained 20-25 mph surface winds west of the dryline
where fuels remain receptive after several days of hot, dry, and
windy conditions. However, the approach of a cold front from the
west across NM and thunderstorm development along the dryline (along
with a potential westward retreat of the dryline during the early
evening hours) will leave a narrow spatial window for favorable
relative humidity reductions into the 10-15% range. The placement
and progression of these features through the day will likely
determine the spatial extent of the fire weather threat. Aloft, the
main jet axis should remain over the region and support another day
of 30-40 mph wind gusts. There are some indications that a weak
mid-level impulse could propagate through the region and support
higher gusts closer to 40-50 mph within the critical risk area, but
the timing of this wave may be offset from peak diurnal mixing and
confidence in this wind potential is generally low.

...Northeast...
Dry northwesterly flow is expected again on Tuesday with winds
generally between 10-15 mph. Little moisture recovery is anticipated
over the next 48 hours, which should keep fuels dry and may support
another day of localized elevated fire weather concerns. As with
Monday's fire weather potential, the spatial extent of the threat
appears confined to portions of MA, NH, possibly into western ME.
The narrow spatial extent precludes a risk area at this time, but
trends will continue to be monitored.

...Rain and snow across much of the West, winding down Tuesday...

...Widespread fire danger remains a concern for the southwestern
quadrant of the U.S. through Monday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average over parts
of the Central Plains; Temperatures will be 15 to 20 below average
over the Great Basin/Southwest...

An upper-level low will develop over the Western U. S. bringing
temperatures 15 to 20 below average over the Great
Basin/Southwest.  The upper-level low will also produce rain and
higher elevation snow across parts of the Pacific
Northwest/California to the Northern Rockies/Great Basin/Southwest
through Tuesday.  The associated front will move into the
Central/Southern Rockies produce snow and lower elevation rain
over parts of the Southwest and the Central/Southern Rockies.  The
snow and lower elevation rain will continue over the
Central/Southern Rockies through Wednesday morning.

However, dry and windy conditions are persistent across the
Southwest into the Central High Plains, Southern Rockies, and
Southern High Plains ahead of the upper-level trough, leading to
continued fire weather concerns. Widespread Red Flag Warnings are
in effect for those areas, along with a Critical Risk of fire
danger. Some light precipitation and cooler temperatures in
portions of the Southwest should positively affect that region on
Monday. Another day of fire danger is expected for eastern Arizona
across New Mexico and into Central/Southern High Plains, where
another Critical Risk is posted.

Meanwhile, a wave of low pressure over the Northern/Central Plains
will move eastward to the Upper Great Lakes by Wednesday.  The
system will produce rain and snow over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes on Monday morning, changing
over to all rain overnight Monday.  Shower and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Central Plains, Upper Mississippi
Valley, and Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday morning.  On Tuesday
afternoon, showers and thunderstorms will develop over parts of
the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley that will continue
into Wednesday morning.  Overnight Tuesday, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Central Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley.  Furthermore, temperatures will be 10
to 15 degrees above average over parts of the Central Plains on
Monday.

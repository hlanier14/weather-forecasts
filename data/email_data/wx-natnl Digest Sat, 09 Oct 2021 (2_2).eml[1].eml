Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 09 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 11 2021

...A wavy front will bring showers, gusty winds, and coastal
flooding along the Mid-Atlantic through this weekend...

...Anomalous heat across the central/southern Plains this weekend
will be followed by strong to severe thunderstorms late Sunday
into early Monday...

...A surge of cold air behind a potent cold front will set the
stage for a wintry weather event for the northern/central Rockies
on Monday...

An increasingly active weather pattern is taking shape across the
U.S. during the next few days as a rapid surge of cold air mass is
forecast to push through the western U.S. against a slow-moving
front near the East Coast while a couple of low pressure systems
are forecast to form in the mid-section of the country.  First of
all, the slow-moving regime in the eastern U.S. will continue to
allow unsettled weather to persist through the weekend and into
early next week for much of the East Coast.  Waves of low pressure
are forecast to form near a stalled front.  The National Hurricane
Center is monitoring the potential for tropical cyclone
development amid these low pressure waves near the North Carolina
coast today into early Sunday.  Regardless of development,
unsettled weather and gusty winds, along with coastal flooding,
can be expected along coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic through
the weekend.  Farther north across much of the Midwest, Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and into the southern Appalachians, a
slow-moving upper trough/low will help trigger additional clusters
of showers and thunderstorms containing locally heavy downpours.
These showers/storms should diminish on Sunday as the upper trough
finally shows signs of dissipation.

For the central and south-central U.S. mainland, a building ridge
of high pressure aloft will bring the potential of record-breaking
heat especially today as temperatures are forecast to soar well
into the 90s to near 100 across the central and southern Plains
this afternoon.  Additionally, the warm temperatures combined with
gusty winds and low relative humidity may lead to elevated fire
weather concerns.  Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches have
been issued across parts of the central to southern High Plains.

In contrast, a deep upper-level trough swinging through the
western U.S. will usher in below average temperatures and chances
for precipitation across much of the Intermountain West and
Rockies into the weekend.  In fact, snow is forecast for the
highest mountain ranges today.  Scattered showers and some
thunderstorms are also expected for the lower elevations today
across the central Rockies.  Meanwhile, a developing low pressure
system ejecting into the northern Plains will likely bring a
period of enhanced rainfall today across the region, along with
the possibility of severe thunderstorms for parts of the area into
early Sunday.  As this system begins to move into the upper Great
Lakes on Sunday, another low pressure system is forecast to
rapidly develop over the southern High Plains.  This system is
expected to bring a higher threat of severe thunderstorms into
Oklahoma on Sunday along with heavy rain.

Last but not least, another cold air mass surging behind a potent
cold front is forecast to move through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday.  This will set the stage for the first potentially
significant wintry weather event of the season for the
northern/central Rockies on Monday where a large low pressure
system is forecast to form.

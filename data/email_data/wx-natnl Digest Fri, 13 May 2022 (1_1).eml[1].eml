Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1158 AM CDT Thu May 12 2022

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS....

The previous forecast remains valid with minor updates. Morning
observations across the NE Panhandle show stratus and cooler
temperatures near and behind a cold front. While erosion of the
surface moisture appears likely across the southern half of NE
Panhandle, it appears unlikely elevated conditions will develop
farther north into the cooler air. The Elevated area was trimmed
south to better capture the elevated fire weather potential.

To the east across portions of western KS and far eastern CO,
morning storms suggests some uncertainty on the eastern extent of
elevated/critical conditions this afternoon. Wetting of fuels may
delay the onset of greater fire weather concerns despite gusty
westerly winds and very low humidity. The eastern edge of the
Elevated area was trimmed slightly westward to account for the early
morning storms. Elsewhere, the forecast remains unchanged. See the
prior discussion for more info.

..Lyons.. 05/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CDT Thu May 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the central Rockies today,
encouraging the deepening of a surface cyclone across the northern
Plains states. As such, deep-layer westerly flow over the Rockies
will encourage strong downslope flow from the Colorado Front Range
southward into eastern New Mexico during the afternoon. 25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with 5-15 percent RH by
afternoon peak heating will encourage high-end Critical fire weather
conditions along the immediate lee of the central Rockies given the
anomalously dry fuels in the area. Locally Extremely Critical
conditions may also appear in terrain-favoring areas where the
ambient winds can be channeled, as well as any location experiencing
persistent higher gusts through the afternoon.

...Heat threat for the Desert Southwest early next week while
persistent southern Plains heat intensifies and expands eastward
into the Southeast...


...Overview...

A trough-ridge-trough pattern aloft across the U.S. northern tier
is forecast to make gradual progress eastward next week, such that
the mean troughs should reach near the East and West Coasts around
Wednesday. Ridging early in the week across the southwestern to
south-central U.S. followed by rising heights over the Southeast
should lead to a broad area of unseasonably hot weather across the
southern U.S., with the most persistent record-breaking heat
centered in Texas and Louisiana. Meanwhile showers and
thunderstorms of varying intensity are possible along fronts
pushed by the mean trough crossing the eastern U.S. and with
stalling fronts across the Plains. The West should see cooling
temperatures in response to upper troughing as the week
progresses, along with lowering snow levels by midweek within
rounds of precipitation.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to be agreeable with the mean pattern,
but with lingering differences with low-predictability shortwave
details within the eastern U.S. trough as well as for shortwaves
moving through and ejecting from the Pacific trough eventually
pushing into the West. Day-to-day frontal position and thus
specifics of convective focus will be sensitive to these uncertain
medium to smaller scale aspects of the forecast that may take
until the short range to resolve. Over the past few days, CMC runs
have been generally slow and deep with the eastern trough around
Mon-Tue. This persisted in the 00Z run but to a lesser extent,
while the newer 12Z run appears even closer to consensus
fortunately. CMC runs have also been more amplified than most
other guidance with the Pacific to western U.S. troughing later
Tuesday into Wednesday-Thursday--though this feature begins
showing more spread in general by midweek onward among
deterministic models and GEFS/EC/CMC ensemble members as not only
uncertain shortwaves pivot, but as stronger energy stemming from
an initial upper low spinning just west of British Columbia could
start spilling southward. Models vary with whether energy will
consolidate into one upper low/trough feature or possibly two
upper lows/troughs, with the latter shown by the 00Z CMC and 12Z
GFS for example. For the updated WPC forecast, began with a blend
of the 00Z/06Z deterministic guidance led by the ECMWF and GFS
runs, then phased out the CMC (and the UKMET as it ends) in favor
of gradually increasing proportions of the GEFS and EC ensemble
means that were reasonably agreeable to downplay the more
uncertain details.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the Southwest and southern Plains and then
eventually rising heights farther east over the Deep South will
likely promote a broad area of heat across much of the southern
U.S. during the period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies
through the period should be over Texas (persisting from the short
range time frame) where some locations could see highs up to
15-25F above normal. The southern half or so of the West will tend
to see highs up to 10-15F above normal for the early part of the
week, followed by a slight cooling trend that reaches California
initially and extends farther eastward by next Thursday as Pacific
upper troughing arrives. Meanwhile by Tuesday or Wednesday through
Thursday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal should extend
eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Southeast. Potential for daily record highs will be most
persistent through the period over parts of the southern Plains
into Louisiana, with numerous records likely to be set.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to
decline as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the
short range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. From Sunday into Monday the best focus
for showers and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing
through the East. There may be one area of emphasis over and near
the south-central Mississippi Valley on Sunday while additional
areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may occur from the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into New England around Monday. There
could be some localized flooding impacts over New England given a
suitable environment for high rainfall rates, but dry soils and
the front being progressive may temper effects. Then from later
Monday through Thursday, the stalling of the leading front and
another one behind it over the Plains along with shortwaves aloft
will provide focus for multiple areas of showers and
thunderstorms/convective complexes across the northern half of the
Plains and Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians. Some rainfall may be heavy, with some added time
required to refine the details of coverage and timing of highest
totals.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 12 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 18 - 22 2022

Today's model solutions show a slightly amplifying mid-level 500-hPa anomaly
pattern over the forecast domain during the 6 to 10 day period. The GEFS and
European ensemble means are both more amplified than yesterday, dropping a
mid-level trough into the Pacific Northwest and Mountain West by the end of
the
period, with the largest 500-hPa height anomalies centered over the northern
Rockies. The Canadian ensemble mean remains less amplified - but does show
mid-level heights slightly lower in the Mountain West than yesterday.
Elsewhere, models generally agree that the strong mid-level ridge over the
Bering Sea and Alaska region, and a relatively zonal pattern will develop with
positive 500-hPa height anomalies across much of the central and southern
CONUS, and mid-level troughing with negative 500-hPa height anomalies in the
northern Rockies and off the northeast CONUS coast.

This forecast pattern results in enhanced chances for above-normal
temperatures
across most of the southern and central CONUS and near the northeastern CONUS
coastline. A significant early-season heat wave centered over the south-
central
CONUS should continue through most of the period, with the highest
probabilities exceeding 80% over parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast.
In
contrast, subnormal temperatures are favored in the north-central and
northwestern CONUS near the developing mid-level trough and below normal
500-hPa heights.

Elevated chances for drier than normal conditions cover much of the
southwestern quarter of the CONUS, near the 500-hPa ridge off the West Coast
and south of the developing trough in the northern Rockies. Subnormal
precipitation is also slightly favored in parts of the Northeast consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool. Meanwhile, increased chances for above
normal precipitation are indicated from the Pacific Northwest into the Great
Lakes, near or downstream from the mean mid-level trough. Slightly above
normal
precipitation is likely over parts of the Southeast due to the forecast
low-level southerly moisture flow and shortwave systems moving across the
region.

The strong ridge centered over the Bering Sea and western Mainland Alaska is
forecast, creating enhanced odds for above normal temperatures and below
normal
precipitation over much of the southwestern Alaska, with enhanced chances for
cooler, slightly wetter conditions farther north of the region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is average, 3
out of 5, because of uncertainties in the evolution of the changing pattern,
and model differences in both the Rockies and eastern CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 20 - 26 2022

There is general model agreement that a relatively zonal pattern should
dominate the forecast domain, with mid-level ridging west of the Pacific Coast
States and over the eastern CONUS. The GEFS and European ensembles continue to
favor a trough over the Mountain West with the largest 500-hPa height
anomalies
centered over the northern Rockies, while the Canadian ensembles show more
de-amplified heights here. Upstream, the forecast ridge over the Bering Sea
and
western Alaska is greatly diminished and the trough over the North Pacific
further shifts northward to the southern Aleutians.

The enhanced chances for above-normal temperatures are favored across most of
the eastern and southern-central CONUS underneath near to above normal 500-hPa
heights. An early-season heat wave centered over the south-central CONUS
should
continue through most of the period. In contrast, below normal temperatures
are
favored in the north-central and northwestern CONUS near the developing
mid-level trough and below normal 500-hPa heights.

Increased chances for above normal precipitation are indicated from the
Pacific
Northwest into the Great Lakes, near or downstream from the mean mid-level
trough. Slightly above normal precipitation is likely over parts of the Middle
and Lower Mississippi Valleys and Southeast due to the forecast low-level
southerly moisture flow and a couple of shortwave systems moving across the
region. Elevated chances for drier than normal conditions cover parts of the
southwestern quarter of the CONUS, near the 500-hPa ridge off the West Coast
and south of the developing trough in the northern Rockies. Below normal
precipitation is also slightly favored in parts of the Northeast coastline
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Mainland Alaska continues to have increased chances for warmer than normal
conditions in southwestern sections, with below normal temperatures and
slightly drier signals favored farther to the northeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is average, 3
out of 5, because of fair agreement in model forecasts, off set by model
inconsistencies and inherent uncertainties of a changing mid-level pattern.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Western Nebraska Panhandle...
Strong westerly flow will linger over the central Rockies through
much of Friday as the upper trough ejects eastward. A cold front is
forecast to move quickly through bringing cooler temperatures to
much of the High Plains. While the airmass will be cooler, dry
downslope flow of 20-25 mph may support a few hours of locally
elevated conditions across portions of the western Nebraska
Panhandle where fuels remain dry.

..Lyons.. 05/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Thu May 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
As an upper trough ejects into Canada at the start of the day
tomorrow/Friday, zonal flow aloft will prevail across the western
and central CONUS. High pressure and weaker ambient surface winds
will prevail across much of the Southwest into the southern High
Plains, serving as a reprieve from the many preceding days of
Critical wildfire-spread conditions. Nonetheless, anomalously dry
fuels will still remain across much of the Southwest into the High
Plains due to an ongoing exceptional drought. Any terrain-favoring
locations that can generate gusty conditions amid very low RH would
support localized wildfire spread.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 12 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is predicted to lead to a continued period
of
anomalous warmth and episodes of possible excessive heat conditions across the
south-central and southeastern U.S. during week-2. Amplified mid-level low
pressure favored over the northwestern contiguous U.S. elevates chances for
anomalous cold and possible much below normal temperatures, high winds, high
elevation snow, and heavy precipitation over many parts of the western and
central lower 48. Springtime flooding remains a concern along the Red River of
the North. Given the potential for below normal temperatures for central and
northern Mainland Alaska, the possible flood risk is limited to the Tanana
Basin in Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat over portions of the Southern Plains, Fri-Sat, May
20-21.

Moderate risk of excessive heat over much of the Southern Plains, Fri-Sat, May
20-21.

Slight risk of episodes of excessive heat over the south-central and
southeastern CONUS, Fri-Thu, May 20-26.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northwestern
CONUS, Fri-Sat, May 20-21.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the northwestern
CONUS, Fri-Sun, May 20-22.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Northern and
Central
Rockies, Sat-Sun, May 21-22.

Moderate risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest, Central and Southern
Rockies, and Central and Southern High Plains, Fri-Sat, May 20-21.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds for much of the central CONUS, Fri-Tue,
May 20-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for many parts of the Central and Southern
Great Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Southeast, Sun-Tue, May 22-24.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 15 - THURSDAY MAY 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!6B7zvHc1Ep8cnGMMvMqsoVgnTQ6DGqKGDlRS55I5btPBzcGYYbkAKeK05Zu9Aa9XaBnUTywPyKpf8BGNhYcYpXGVnr4$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 20 - THURSDAY MAY 26: The 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles'
500-hPa week-2 mean height forecasts are in good agreement over North America,
featuring amplified troughing throughout the western and central CONUS, and
downstream ridging east of the Mississippi River. This pattern is more
amplified in today's guidance compared to yesterday, leading to slight
expansions for many of the temperature risk areas.



With positive mid-level height departures favored to linger across the
southern
tier by the outset of week-2, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to
indicate a broad area with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperature
exceeding the 85th percentile in the region. The ECMWF reforecast tool has a
stronger, more expansive warm signal than the GEFS early in the period, even
indicating at least an 80% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile over Texas and Oklahoma on day 8 (May 20). Therefore, the high
(>60%
chance) and moderate (>40% chance) risk of excessive heat is somewhat expanded
over the Southern Plains in today's outlook compared to yesterday, and
extended
to day 8 to 9 (May 20 to 21). The broader slight risk (>20% chance) area is
highlighted over the entirety of week-2 to indicate enhanced potential for
episodes of excessive heat across south-central and southeastern CONUS,
including Tennessee given the increased heat signal in the tools. This
elevated
potential for excessive heat continues to be further supported by uncalibrated
temperature guidance, as well as the National Blend of Models analysis
depicting several locations approaching near record breaking temperatures
(>100
degrees F in parts of Texas) early in the period.



The amplifying mid-level trough, and prevailing northwesterly flow favored in
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles is expected to bring unseasonably cold
temperatures throughout much of the northwestern and north-central CONUS.
Relative to yesterday, a stronger cold trend is reflected in the GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools, with both indicating a larger and more persistent coverage
of
at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile
and below freezing. Thus, the slight (>20% chance) and moderate (>40% chance)
risk of much below normal temperatures have been expanded in coverage across
the northwestern CONUS in today's outlook for May 20 to 22 and May 20 to 21,
respectively. While the coldest temperatures (<28 degrees F) are favored for
the highest elevations, any frost and/or freezes in the lower elevations may
lead to adverse impacts as sub-freezing temperatures would be considered
fairly
late for this time of the year in the region.



Enhanced onshore flow and Pacific moisture is anticipated to bring increased
amounts of precipitation to the lee side of the amplifying trough aloft. Given
the combination of anomalously cold temperatures and above-normal
precipitation
favored during week-2, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted over the higher
elevations of the Northern and Central Rockies for May 21 to 22. This is also
supported by the GEFS snow water equivalent reforecast tool as well as some of
the latest deterministic GFS solutions and uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble
guidance
depicting locally heavy snowfall accumulations in the region next weekend.



At the base of the amplified trough early in the period, a slight risk of
episodes of high winds is posted for May 20 to 24 across the central CONUS.
This adjustment is supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools which
show a larger coverage of increased probabilities (>20%) for wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph. In addition, both the latest GEFS and
ECMWF ensembles continue to favor a sub 1000-hPa mean low forming over eastern
Colorado late next week which would induce strong pressure gradients early in
the period. Given this trend, a moderate risk of high winds is issued for
parts
of the Southwest, Central and Southern Rockies, and Central and Southern High
Plains for May 20 to 21. The continued potential for high winds is likely to
sustain an elevated wildfire risk during the outlook period across many parts
of the Four Corner region where multiple large wildfires are currently
ongoing.
The largest wildfire incident is the Calf Canyon fire located east of Santa
Fe,
which has burned over 259,000 acres (as of May 12) with less than half
containment.



With lee side cyclogenesis favored during the first several days of the
period,
there is also better ensemble support for the advection of Gulf of Mexico
moisture conducive for potentially heavy precipitation, most likely across the
south-central/southeastern CONUS tied to this surface low. A slight risk area
of heavy precipitation is posted over parts of the Central and Southern Great
Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Southeast, May 22 to 24, primarily based on the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble
and
ECMWF reforecast tool given good run to run model consistency. The ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across the highlighted area.



Across the tropics, there continues to be good model support for a
convectively
coupled Kelvin wave aloft traversing the western Hemisphere during week-2,
which is conducive for possible early season tropical cyclone formation.
Several runs of GEFS ensemble members continue to show a handful of deepening
low pressure centers tracking northward in the Caribbean, resulting in
continued enhanced precipitation signals in the ensemble mean daily totals, as
well as in the GEFS reforecast tool throughout the Caribbean and Florida
during
mid to late week-2. While this is suggestive of the first signs of tropical
cyclone development in the Atlantic for the season, no corresponding
precipitation related hazards are posted given general uncertainty at this
lead, and that these solutions remain isolated to one model. However, any
potential tropical developments and consensus among the models and
probabilistic tropical cyclone tools will be addressed in subsequent week-2
U.S. hazards outlooks.



Flooding is likely to persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the
North, and extending into part of the James River basin due to ongoing
snowmelt
and above-normal precipitation favored during week-1. The North Central River
Forecast Center indicates potential for flooding across parts of northern
Minnesota in their 5-day significant river outlook. Anticipated possible
enhanced precipitation across this region during weeks 1 and 2 could support
possible flooding across the region during week-2. This would likely be more
attributed to saturated soils than snowmelt since much of the snow has already
melted. Given uncertainty at this time of flood levels, a related hazard is
not
included at this time. Across Alaska, below-normal temperatures are
predominately favored throughout much of the Mainland. Although anomalously
cold temperatures may slow the rate of springtime snowmelt, thus the possible
flood hazard is limited to the Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska.

...Rapidly developing low pressure system will bring rounds of
heavy rain, severe thunderstorms and strong winds across the Upper
Midwest and northern Plains through tonight...

...Summer-like heat from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes
and northern New England will continue to challenge daily
records...

...Unsettled weather along the East Coast and in the Lower
Mississippi Valley into the start of the upcoming weekend...

...Cooler and damp for in the Pacific Northwest with some periods
of mountain snow this afternoon...

A busy afternoon and evening is in store throughout the Northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley as a strengthening storm
system triggers rounds of showers and thunderstorms. Some storms
will be severe with dangerous wind gusts, tornadoes, and large
hail expected. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Moderate
Risk for severe weather in parts of eastern South Dakota,
southeast North Dakota, and western Minnesota where destructive
winds could transpire within the more intense severe storms. In
addition to the severe threat, these storms will also be capable
of producing Excessive Rainfall rates. A pair of Slight Risks is
in place over portions of eastern Montana and western North
Dakota, as well as the eastern Dakotas and western Minnesota.
These areas could witness area of flooding, especially where soils
are the most saturated. On Friday, the storm system lifts north
into south-central Canada while its cold front slowly inches east
across the Midwest and central Plains. While not as significant of
a severe threat as today, there is still a Slight Risk that
stretches from northeast Oklahoma on north into the western Great
Lakes region. There is also a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall
for similar at-risk areas for severe weather on Friday. The front
makes a little more eastward progress on Saturday but still remain
a focal point for afternoon and evening clusters of showers and
thunderstorms. Storm could be severe from the Great Lakes on south
to West Texas, but it is the central Plains and Ozarks that
feature the best odds for witnessing organized severe weather.

Meanwhile, an early taste of summer continues in the Southern
Plains and throughout much of the Mississippi Valley this
afternoon, while even parts of northern New England experiences
near-record highs in the mid-upper 80s. Temperatures do moderate
some on Friday as the aforementioned cold front tracks across the
Heartland but above normal temperature anomalies on the order of
10-15 degrees is still expected. The hottest temperatures versus
normal will set up show over the Great Lakes and northern New
England where highs ranging 20-30 degrees above normal will
challenge daily record highs in the mid-upper 80s. By Saturday,
summer-esque heat arrives in the Desert Southwest where some
record heat is possible. This prolonged stretch of summer looks to
stick around in the Southern Plains throughout the weekend with
daily chances for record breaking heat. As for good news, after a
multi-day string of Critical to Extreme Risks of Fire Weather
conditions in the southern High Plains and Southwest, winds look
to relax enough to finally provide from dangerous fire weather
conditions, although more summer-like heat and dry conditions
persist.

Farther east, a wave of low pressure will meander along the
Southeast coast tomorrow and then slowly work its way up the East
Coast on Saturday. This low pressure system will provide an influx
of Atlantic moisture along the East Coast, leading to the daily
opportunities for spotty showers and thunderstorms from the
Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Locally heavy rainfall rates are
possible, most notably in the Southeast today and Friday. As the
low begins to lift north along the front positioned off the coast
Saturday afternoon, some showers and storms may pop-up across
portions of the Northeast. In the Lower Mississippi Valley, a
stalled front will help to ignite scattered thunderstorms this
afternoon. A Slight Risk for severe weather has been issued in
central Mississippi for this afternoon and evening. The front
weakens slightly on Friday but still help to spark additional
showers and storm in the Lower Mississippi Valley on Friday.

To the West, a frontal system is bringing periods of rain and
mountain snow in the Pacific Northwest. Winter Weather Advisories
were are in effect for parts of the Cascades this afternoon. This
storm system will also lead to another injection of cool Pacific
air from the Pacific Northwest to the northern High Plains.
Abnormally cool conditions look to hang around through Saturday
but rebound to seasonally warm levels by Sunday as upper level
ridging builds in aloft.

...Heat threat for the Desert Southwest early next week while
persistent southern Plains heat intensifies and expands eastward
into the Southeast...


...Overview...

A trough-ridge-trough pattern aloft across the U.S. northern tier
is forecast to make gradual progress eastward next week, such that
the mean troughs should reach near the East and West Coasts around
Wednesday. Ridging early in the week across the southwestern to
south-central U.S. followed by rising heights over the Southeast
should lead to a broad area of unseasonably hot weather across the
southern U.S., with the most persistent record-breaking heat
centered in Texas and Louisiana. Meanwhile showers and
thunderstorms of varying intensity are possible along fronts
pushed by the mean trough crossing the eastern U.S. and with
stalling fronts across the Plains. The West should see cooling
temperatures in response to upper troughing as the week
progresses, along with lowering snow levels by midweek within
rounds of precipitation.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to be agreeable with the mean pattern,
but with lingering differences with low-predictability shortwave
details within the eastern U.S. trough as well as for shortwaves
moving through and ejecting from the Pacific trough eventually
pushing into the West. Day-to-day frontal position and thus
specifics of convective focus will be sensitive to these uncertain
medium to smaller scale aspects of the forecast that may take
until the short range to resolve. Over the past few days, CMC runs
have been generally slow and deep with the eastern trough around
Mon-Tue. This persisted in the 00Z run but to a lesser extent,
while the newer 12Z run appears even closer to consensus
fortunately. CMC runs have also been more amplified than most
other guidance with the Pacific to western U.S. troughing later
Tuesday into Wednesday-Thursday--though this feature begins
showing more spread in general by midweek onward among
deterministic models and GEFS/EC/CMC ensemble members as not only
uncertain shortwaves pivot, but as stronger energy stemming from
an initial upper low spinning just west of British Columbia could
start spilling southward. Models vary with whether energy will
consolidate into one upper low/trough feature or possibly two
upper lows/troughs, with the latter shown by the 00Z CMC and 12Z
GFS for example. For the updated WPC forecast, began with a blend
of the 00Z/06Z deterministic guidance led by the ECMWF and GFS
runs, then phased out the CMC (and the UKMET as it ends) in favor
of gradually increasing proportions of the GEFS and EC ensemble
means that were reasonably agreeable to downplay the more
uncertain details.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the Southwest and southern Plains and then
eventually rising heights farther east over the Deep South will
likely promote a broad area of heat across much of the southern
U.S. during the period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies
through the period should be over Texas (persisting from the short
range time frame) where some locations could see highs up to
15-25F above normal. The southern half or so of the West will tend
to see highs up to 10-15F above normal for the early part of the
week, followed by a slight cooling trend that reaches California
initially and extends farther eastward by next Thursday as Pacific
upper troughing arrives. Meanwhile by Tuesday or Wednesday through
Thursday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal should extend
eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Southeast. Potential for daily record highs will be most
persistent through the period over parts of the southern Plains
into Louisiana, with numerous records likely to be set.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to
decline as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the
short range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. From Sunday into Monday the best focus
for showers and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing
through the East. There may be one area of emphasis over and near
the south-central Mississippi Valley on Sunday while additional
areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may occur from the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into New England around Monday. There
could be some localized flooding impacts over New England given a
suitable environment for high rainfall rates, but dry soils and
the front being progressive may temper effects. Then from later
Monday through Thursday, the stalling of the leading front and
another one behind it over the Plains along with shortwaves aloft
will provide focus for multiple areas of showers and
thunderstorms/convective complexes across the northern half of the
Plains and Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians. Some rainfall may be heavy, with some added time
required to refine the details of coverage and timing of highest
totals.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 12 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is predicted to lead to a continued period
of
anomalous warmth and episodes of possible excessive heat conditions across the
south-central and southeastern U.S. during week-2. Amplified mid-level low
pressure favored over the northwestern contiguous U.S. elevates chances for
anomalous cold and possible much below normal temperatures, high winds, high
elevation snow, and heavy precipitation over many parts of the western and
central lower 48. Springtime flooding remains a concern along the Red River of
the North. Given the potential for below normal temperatures for central and
northern Mainland Alaska, the possible flood risk is limited to the Tanana
Basin in Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat over portions of the Southern Plains, Fri-Sat, May
20-21.

Moderate risk of excessive heat over much of the Southern Plains, Fri-Sat, May
20-21.

Slight risk of episodes of excessive heat over the south-central and
southeastern CONUS, Fri-Thu, May 20-26.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northwestern
CONUS, Fri-Sat, May 20-21.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the northwestern
CONUS, Fri-Sun, May 20-22.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Northern and
Central
Rockies, Sat-Sun, May 21-22.

Moderate risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest, Central and Southern
Rockies, and Central and Southern High Plains, Fri-Sat, May 20-21.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds for much of the central CONUS, Fri-Tue,
May 20-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for many parts of the Central and Southern
Great Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Southeast, Sun-Tue, May 22-24.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 15 - THURSDAY MAY 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!47_qcMEPflvX5g32H-Xrh6VZNqxVHh60HiaJ4_yCLhKkC9HRxN8XaGmveMSUus5iUm5eW2N0Bwx2VByUJM4_caBtBuE$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 20 - THURSDAY MAY 26: The 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles'
500-hPa week-2 mean height forecasts are in good agreement over North America,
featuring amplified troughing throughout the western and central CONUS, and
downstream ridging east of the Mississippi River. This pattern is more
amplified in today's guidance compared to yesterday, leading to slight
expansions for many of the temperature risk areas.



With positive mid-level height departures favored to linger across the
southern
tier by the outset of week-2, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to
indicate a broad area with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperature
exceeding the 85th percentile in the region. The ECMWF reforecast tool has a
stronger, more expansive warm signal than the GEFS early in the period, even
indicating at least an 80% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile over Texas and Oklahoma to day 8 to 9 (May 20 to 21). Therefore,
the
high (>60% chance) and moderate (>40% chance) risk of excessive heat is
somewhat expanded over the Southern Plains in today's outlook compared to
yesterday, and extended to day 8 to 9 (May 20 to 21). The broader slight risk
(>20% chance) area is highlighted over the entirety of week-2 to indicate
enhanced potential for episodes of excessive heat across south-central and
southeastern CONUS, including Tennessee given the increased heat signal in the
tools. This elevated potential for excessive heat continues to be further
supported by uncalibrated temperature guidance, as well as the National Blend
of Models analysis depicting several locations approaching near record
breaking
temperatures (>100 degrees F in parts of Texas) early in the period.



The amplifying mid-level trough, and prevailing northwesterly flow favored in
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles is expected to bring unseasonably cold
temperatures throughout much of the northwestern and north-central CONUS.
Relative to yesterday, a stronger cold trend is reflected in the GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools, with both indicating a larger and more persistent coverage
of
at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile
and below freezing. Thus, the slight (>20% chance) and moderate (>40% chance)
risk of much below normal temperatures have been expanded in coverage across
the northwestern CONUS in today's outlook for May 20 to 22 and May 20 to 21,
respectively. While the coldest temperatures (<28 degrees F) are favored for
the highest elevations, any frost and/or freezes in the lower elevations may
lead to adverse impacts as sub-freezing temperatures would be considered
fairly
late for this time of the year in the region.



Enhanced onshore flow and Pacific moisture is anticipated to bring increased
amounts of precipitation to the lee side of the amplifying trough aloft. Given
the combination of anomalously cold temperatures and above-normal
precipitation
favored during week-2, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted over the higher
elevations of the Northern and Central Rockies for May 21 to 22. This is also
supported by the GEFS snow water equivalent reforecast tool as well as some of
the latest deterministic GFS solutions and uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble
guidance
depicting locally heavy snowfall accumulations in the region next weekend.



At the base of the amplified trough early in the period, a slight risk of
episodes of high winds is posted for May 20 to 24 across the central CONUS.
The
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to show increased probabilities
(>20%)
for wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph. In addition, both the
latest GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to favor a sub 1000-hPa mean low
forming over eastern Colorado late next week which would induce strong
pressure
gradients early in the period. Given this trend, a moderate risk of high winds
is issued for parts of the Southwest, Central and Southern Rockies, and
Central
and Southern High Plains for May 20 to 21. The continued potential for high
winds is likely to sustain an elevated wildfire risk during the outlook period
across many parts of the Four Corner region where multiple large wildfires are
currently ongoing. The largest wildfire incident is the Calf Canyon fire
located east of Santa Fe, which has burned over 259,000 acres (as of May 12)
with less than half containment.



With lee side cyclogenesis favored during the first several days of the
period,
there is also better ensemble support for the advection of Gulf of Mexico
moisture conducive for potentially heavy precipitation, most likely across the
south-central/southeastern CONUS tied to this surface low. A slight risk area
of heavy precipitation is posted over parts of the Central and Southern Great
Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Southeast, May 22 to 24, primarily based on the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble
and
ECMWF reforecast tool given good run to run model consistency. The ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across the highlighted area.



Across the tropics, there continues to be good model support for a
convectively
coupled Kelvin wave aloft traversing the western Hemisphere during week-2,
which is conducive for possible early season tropical cyclone formation.
Several runs of GEFS ensemble members continue to show a handful of deepening
low pressure centers tracking northward in the Caribbean, resulting in
continued enhanced precipitation signals in the ensemble mean daily totals, as
well as in the GEFS reforecast tool throughout the Caribbean and Florida
during
mid to late week-2. While this is suggestive of the first signs of tropical
cyclone development in the Atlantic for the season, no corresponding
precipitation related hazards are posted given general uncertainty at this
lead, and that these solutions remain isolated to one model. However, any
potential tropical developments and consensus among the models and
probabilistic tropical cyclone tools will be addressed in subsequent week-2
U.S. hazards outlooks.



Flooding is likely to persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the
North, and extending into part of the James River basin due to ongoing
snowmelt
and above-normal precipitation favored during week-1. The North Central River
Forecast Center indicates potential for flooding across parts of northern
Minnesota in their 5-day significant river outlook. Anticipated possible
enhanced precipitation across this region during weeks 1 and 2 could support
possible flooding across the region during week-2. This would likely be more
attributed to saturated soils than snowmelt since much of the snow has already
melted. Given uncertainty at this time of flood levels, a related hazard is
not
included at this time. Across Alaska, below-normal temperatures are
predominately favored throughout much of the Mainland. Although anomalously
cold temperatures may slow the rate of springtime snowmelt, thus the possible
flood hazard is limited to the Tanana Basin in Mainland Alaska.

...Summer-like heat from the southern Plains to the Great Lakes
and northern New England will continue to challenge daily
records...

...Unsettled weather along the East Coast and in the Lower
Mississippi Valley into the start of the upcoming weekend...

...Cooler and damp for in the Pacific Northwest with some periods
of mountain snow this morning...

On Friday, the storm system responsible for producing severe
weather over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Thursday,
lifts north into south-central Canada while its cold front slowly
inches east across the Midwest and central Plains. While not as
significant of a severe threat as Thursday, there is still a
Slight Risk that stretches from northeast Oklahoma on north into
the western Great Lakes region. There is also a Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall for similar at-risk areas for severe weather on
Friday. The front makes a little more eastward progress on
Saturday but will still remain a focal point for afternoon and
evening clusters of showers and thunderstorms. Storms could be
severe from the Great Lakes on south to West Texas, but it is the
central Plains and Ozarks that feature the best odds for
witnessing organized severe weather.

Meanwhile, temperatures moderate some on Friday as the
aforementioned cold front tracks across the Heartland but above
normal temperature anomalies on the order of 10-15 degrees are
still expected. The hottest temperatures versus normal will set up
shop over the Great Lakes and northern New England where highs
ranging 20-30 degrees above normal will challenge daily record
highs in the mid-upper 80s. By Saturday, summer-esque heat arrives
in the Desert Southwest where some record heat is possible. This
prolonged stretch of summer looks to stick around in the Southern
Plains throughout the weekend with daily chances for record
breaking heat. As for good news, after a multi-day string of
Critical to Extreme Risks of Fire Weather conditions in the
southern High Plains and Southwest, winds look to relax enough to
finally provide from dangerous fire weather conditions, although
more summer-like heat and dry conditions persist.

Farther east, a wave of low pressure will meander along the
Southeast coast tomorrow and then slowly work its way up the East
Coast on Saturday. This low pressure system will provide an influx
of Atlantic moisture along the East Coast, leading to the daily
opportunities for spotty showers and thunderstorms from the
Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Locally heavy rainfall rates are
possible, most notably in the Southeast today and Friday. As the
low begins to lift north along the front positioned off the coast
Saturday afternoon, some showers and storms may pop-up across
portions of the Northeast. To the West, a frontal system is
bringing periods of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific
Northwest. This storm system will also lead to another injection
of cool Pacific air from the Pacific Northwest to the northern
High Plains. Abnormally cool conditions look to hang around
through Saturday but rebound to seasonally warm levels by Sunday
as upper level ridging builds in aloft.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough, currently near the Nevada/Utah border,
will shift east this morning and take on a negative tilt as it moves
through the northern Plains. At the surface, a strong surface low
will continue to deepen as it moves into North Dakota and eventually
into the southern Canadian Prairie. Some deep mixing is expected
across Nebraska and southern South Dakota which could result in some
dry and breezy conditions. However, fuels are quite moist across
this region, and therefore, the fire weather threat should remain
limited.

Dry conditions will remain across the Southwestern states where
fuels are near record dryness in some locations. However, winds will
be light, precluding the fire weather threat.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge will build into the western CONUS on Saturday.
Some stronger flow will remain across the Northern Plains as the
pattern amplifies. Some deep mixing is expected beneath this
stronger mid-level flow which will lead to some dry and breezy
conditions across portions of South Dakota and Nebraska. ERCs are
low across these areas and therefore, the fire weather threat should
remain minimal despite the potential for dry and breezy conditions.


Ridging building across the Southwest will keep surface winds
relatively weak on Saturday. This will result in benign fire weather
conditions.

...Heat threat for the Desert Southwest early next week while
persistent southern Plains heat intensifies and expands eastward
into the Southeast...


...Overview...

Mean troughs over the East and West Coasts, with ridging in
between, should make gradual progress eastward during the first
half of next week. Upper ridging across the Southwest and
south-central U.S. should spread into the Southeast the second
half of the week in response to an amplifying trough over the
West. This should continue to lead to a broad area of unseasonably
hot weather across the southern U.S., with the most persistent and
record-breaking heat centered in Texas and Louisiana. Meanwhile,
expected showers and thunderstorms to accompany an initial front
across the East, with increasing showers also expected along
stalling fronts in the Plains. The West should see cooling
temperatures in response to upper troughing as the week
progresses, along with lowering snow levels by midweek within
rounds of precipitation.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to show fairly good agreement with the
overall pattern during the extended range, but struggle with
low-predictability shortwave details with the Northeastern trough,
as well as energy moving through and ejecting from the Pacific to
Western U.S. trough. Frontal positions and thus specifics of
convective focus will be sensitive to these uncertain aspects
which could take into the short range to resolve. The most notable
differences seem to arrive around Wednesday with a leading
shortwave ejecting from troughing over the northeast Pacific into
the Northwest and eventually northern Plains. Up until the most
recent 00z run (available after forecast generation time), the CMC
had consistently been faster and more pronounced with this
shortwave, while the GFS and ECMWF are weaker. Farther upstream,
uncertainty surrounds the details of a closed low off the British
Columbia coast which may move into the Northwest U.S. late next
week. Likely in response to a stronger downstream shortwave, the
12z/May 12 CMC was significantly weaker and less amplified with
this feature as it moves through the West but the 00z run is more
consistent with the consensus. Ensembles and the ensemble means
support a more amplified pattern across the U.S. by late next week
as shown by both the GFS and ECMWF (which between themselves have
some pretty significant timing and trough detail differences by
day 6-7). The WPC blend for tonight used the deterministic models
days 3-5, with increasing ensemble means late period to downplay
the more uncertain details. Did continue some modest ECMWF and GFS
just for some added definition to individual systems. This
approach fit well with previous WPC continuity as well.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the Southwest and southern Plains and then
eventually rising heights farther east over the Deep South will
likely promote a broad area of heat across much of the southern
U.S. during the period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies
through the period should be over Texas (persisting from the short
range time frame) where some locations could see highs up to
15-25F above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely.
Parts of the Southwest U.S. should see excessive heat early in the
week, with a few records Monday-Tuesday, but temperatures should
moderate as Pacific troughing moves in thereafter. Meanwhile by
Tuesday or Wednesday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal
should extend eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and
into the Southeast with again, potential for daily record highs.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to lower
as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the short
range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. On Monday, the best focus for showers
and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing through the
East with the best chance for locally moderate to heavy rainfall
across New England. Localized flooding impacts over New England
are possible given a suitable environment for high rainfall rates,
but dry soils and the front being progressive tempers confidence.
Into the middle part of the week, a stalled boundary from the
Plains to the Ohio Valley will provide focus for multiple areas of
showers and thunderstorms/convective complexes across the northern
half of the Plains and Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians. Ingredients are there for heavy rainfall,
but plenty of uncertainty remains in the guidance with respect to
coverage and amounts.

12z/May 12 CMC was significantly weaker and less amplified with
this feature as it moves through the West but the 00z run is more
consistent with the consensus. Ensembles and the ensemble means
support a more amplified pattern across the U.S. by late next week
as shown by both the GFS and ECMWF (which between themselves have
some pretty significant timing and trough detail differences by
day 6-7). The WPC blend for tonight used the deterministic models
days 3-5, with increasing ensemble means late period to downplay
the more uncertain details. Did continue some modest ECMWF and GFS
just for some added definition to individual systems. This
approach fit well with previous WPC continuity as well.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the Southwest and southern Plains and then
eventually rising heights farther east over the Deep South will
likely promote a broad area of heat across much of the southern
U.S. during the period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies
through the period should be over Texas (persisting from the short
range time frame) where some locations could see highs up to
15-25F above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely.
Parts of the Southwest U.S. should see excessive heat early in the
week, with a few records Monday-Tuesday, but temperatures should
moderate as Pacific troughing moves in thereafter. Meanwhile by
Tuesday or Wednesday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal
should extend eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and
into the Southeast with again, potential for daily record highs.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to lower
as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the short
range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. On Monday, the best focus for showers
and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing through the
East with the best chance for locally moderate to heavy rainfall
across New England. Localized flooding impacts over New England
are possible given a suitable environment for high rainfall rates,
but dry soils and the front being progressive tempers confidence.
Into the middle part of the week, a stalled boundary from the
Plains to the Ohio Valley will provide focus for multiple areas of
showers and thunderstorms/convective complexes across the northern
half of the Plains and Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley and
central Appalachians. Ingredients are there for heavy rainfall,
but plenty of uncertainty remains in the guidance with respect to
coverage and amounts.

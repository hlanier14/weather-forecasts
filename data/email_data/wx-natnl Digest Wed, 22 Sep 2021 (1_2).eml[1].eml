..Bentley.. 09/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CDT Tue Sep 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A surface cold front will continue to push south and east across the
southern Plains and lower Mississippi River Valley today as an
upper-level trough continues to deepen over the south-central CONUS.
Dry air advecting in behind this front, combined with breezy
pressure-gradient winds, should support at least low-end fire
weather concerns over the southern Plains. Elsewhere, recent
rainfall and/or a weak flow pattern will mitigate additional fire
weather concerns.

...Southern Plains...
Early morning surface observations show breezy conditions ongoing
across much of OK and northern TX behind a southward-sagging cold
front. Building surface high pressure over the central High Plains
will maintain the pressure gradient and breezy conditions through
the day. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely, and gusts
up to 25-30 mph are probable. Surface observations also show dry air
advecting southward out of western KS where dewpoints are in the low
40s. Despite much cooler temperatures, this unseasonably dry air may
support RH reductions into the 20-30% range. Areas of elevated
conditions are likely this afternoon across northwest TX and
southwest OK where ERC values are in the 80-85th percentile and
wetting rainfall has not occurred for around 30 days for some
locations.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 21 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong area of mid-level high pressure is expected to prevail o=
ver
the central U.S. where anomalously warm temperatures are predicted to end
September. Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored for Mainland
Alaska due to the presence of mid-level low pressure. Increasing onshore fl=
ow
is expected to bring a wetter pattern to the Pacific Northwest next week. A
tropical wave in the Atlantic is likely to become a tropical cyclone later
this
week and its future track should be closely monitored.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures for the Great Plains and Ozar=
ks,
Wed-Thu, Sep 29-30.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of Mainland Alaska,
Wed-Thu, Sep 29-30.

FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 29 - TUESDAY OCTOBER 05: Excellent model agreement =
and
continuity continues regarding a high amplitude ridge centered over the mid=
dle
to higher latitudes of central North America during late September. Ensembl=
e
means for the week-2 period depict the largest 500-hPa height departures of
more than +120 meters across the northern Great Plains and Upper Mississipp=
i
Valley. Although maximum temperatures and heat index values are forecast to
remain below heat advisory criteria, given the time of year, a slight risk =
of
much above normal temperatures is maintained for the Great Plains since thi=
s
anomalous warmth may lead to intensifying and developing drought. Although =
the
GEFS reforecast tool supports a moderate risk, probabilities for maximum
temperatures to reach the 85th percentile of the climatological distributio=
n
are much lower in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Due to these large differences=
 in

...Heavy rainfall will slowly exit the Northeast/New England
Friday into Saturday...


...Overview...

Upper ridging over the Labrador Sea and off the West Coast into
the Great Basin will favor troughing over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low over the Southwest.
Troughing over the North Pacific this weekend will dive
southeastward early next week toward the Pacific Northwest. This
favors a mostly dry pattern once the lead eastern system moves
into Atlantic Canada and generally moderating temperatures.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A pair of interacting closed upper level lows evolving over the
Great Lakes and Northeast later this week through the weekend will
carry a pair of fronts through the area. The lead system will
support a wrapped-up front with possible surface wave development
off the Carolinas late Fri/early Sat that may lift northward
toward the Gulf of Maine by early Sunday. Trailing upper low will
support a secondary cold front eventually reinforcing the lead
boundary and helping to move it out of the Northeast. Guidance has
wavered markedly on how to handle this interaction/dumbelling but
the latest two cycles were closer to agreement. With such a
meridional flow, considerable moisture will flow northward out of
the sub-tropics in a narrow axis into New England Friday into
Saturday as the front slowly moves eastward. Some solutions like
the 00Z UKMET were especially bullish and, though possible, will
be sensitive to the east-west sharpness of the upper trough and
degree of tilt back to the NNW.

Elsewhere, model agreement was near average outside the Southwest.
There, the 00Z/06Z GFS runs were slightly/much farther east,
respectively, than the ECMWF-led consensus and were not preferred.
Into the PacNW, the 00Z UKMET and then the Canadian departed from
the ensemble consensus with the timing/depth of the trough south
of the Gulf of Alaska though the multi-day ensemble trend was for
a sharper trough (much like the East).

The WPC preference was mainly a non-GFS blend (though it was
reasonable in the East); favored the 00Z ECMWF through the period
with some contribution from the CMC/UKMET. Trended toward an
increasing weight of the 00Z ECMWF ensemble mean and Canadian
mean. This favored well with continuity while adjusting toward the
latest trends in the guidance.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow-moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Friday into Saturday. The second system in its wake
will bring additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a
stationary/stalled frontal boundary draped across central/south
Florida will bring daily chances of diurnally-driven
thunderstorms. Much of the rest of the Lower 48 will be relatively
dry, though some isolated showers and storms will be possible
across portions of CA/NV/AZ associated with the weak closed upper
level low late this weekend into early next week.

Cooler, fall-like temperatures will prevail across the
central/eastern CONUS Friday into the weekend in the wake of the
cold frontal passages. Highs 5-10F below normal are expected while
nighttime lows up to 10F below normal are likely, particularly
across the Gulf Coast region with dew points into the 50s/60s.
Temperatures will moderate this weekend into next week. Meanwhile,
upper level ridging will promote above normal readings for the
interior western CONUS to the Plains with highs/lows about 5F to
as much as 10-15F above normal. Temperatures will trend cooler
next week in the Pacific Northwest as a lead and then more
substantial trailing cold front move into the area.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue September 21 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 27 - OCT 01, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a deep trough over
the
Arctic region stretching from northern Alaska to the Gulf of Alaska. Negati=
ve
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most of Mainland Alaska, the Ala=
ska
Panhandle and parts of the northwestern CONUS, while positive 500-hPa heigh=
t
anomalies are favored over the western Aleutians. A broad ridge and associa=
ted
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of the central
CONUS.
A trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heig=
hts
anticipated across the East Coast.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for most of the CONUS due to
persistent broad ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights over the region a=
nd
also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal temperat=
ure
probabilities are elevated over Alaska underneath predicted troughing and
below
normal 500-hPa heights, while above normal temperature probabilities are
elevated over the western Aleutians, under above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of =
the
western CONUS due to a forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska and potentia=
l
storm system development. Below normal precipitation is likely for most of =
the
central and eastern CONUS underneath forecast ridging and above normal 500-=
hPa
heights. However, a predicted trough over the northeastern CONUS enhances
probabilities of above normal precipitation over Maine. Troughing and
associated surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska increases the odds =
of
above normal precipitation over the Panhandle due to increased southerly fl=
ow.
Near to below normal precipitation probabilities are increased over Mainlan=
d
Alaska due to being farther displaced from the forecast surface low pressur=
e.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 29 - OCT 05, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on th=
e
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over the
western Aleutians, while a trough and below normal 500-hPa heights are
predicted over Mainland Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle an=
d
parts of the northwestern CONUS. Predicted riding and positive 500-hPa heig=
ht
anomalies are forecast over much of CONUS except for the Gulf Coast where w=
eak
negative height anomalies are indicated.

Anomalous ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights increases chances of ab=
ove
normal temperatures over most of the western and central CONUS as well as t=
he
Northeast. Below normal temperatures are favored over Florida under below
normal 500-hPa heights. Near normal temperatures are likely over parts of t=
he
eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF operational autoblend forecast tool.
Predicted troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly
mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures
across most of the state.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of =
the
western CONUS due to a forecast trough over the Gulf of Alaska. Near to bel=
ow
normal precipitation is favored across most of the central and eastern CONU=
S,
under the broad ridging and positive 500-hPa heights. The eastward progress=
ion
of the trough over the Gulf of Alaska toward the west coast of British
Columbia
favors increased chances for above normal precipitation across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. Near to below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased for the remainder of the state, o=
n
the backside of the trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

..Bentley.. 09/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Tue Sep 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper-level trough is expected to move through the
Pacific Northwest on Wednesday, resulting in increasing low and
mid-level winds. Despite recent rainfall over the western CONUS,
parts of the northern Sierra/northwest Great Basin and northern
Rockies/High Plains remain dry and may see elevated fire weather
conditions evolve as winds increase through the day.

...Northwest Nevada...
Zonal mid-level flow is forecast to increase with the approach and
passage of a progressive shortwave trough. This will result in
strengthening downslope flow off the northern Sierra into northwest
NV. High-res and ensemble guidance suggests winds between 15-20 mph
are probable and will be coincident with RH reductions into the
teens. Although ERC values have fallen in recent days, many
locations report values above the 50th percentile, which will
support at least a low-end fire weather concern. Elevated conditions
may extend as far east as northeast NV, but confidence in this
scenario is low.

...Northern Montana...
A deepening surface low over the Canadian Prairies will augment west
to southwesterly pressure-gradient winds over northern MT through
the day. Sustained winds in the upper teens are expected, and some
degree of downslope warming/drying will support RH values in the
15-25% range. While some locations have seen recent rainfall, fuels
remain dry within the precipitation gaps, and may be receptive to
fire spread given the expected wind/RH combinations. Locally
critical conditions are possible in the immediate lee of the terrain
of western MT, but widespread critical conditions are not
anticipated.

400 PM EDT Tue Sep 21 2021

Valid 00Z Wed Sep 22 2021 - 00Z Fri Sep 24 2021

...Slow-moving cold front to bring heavy rain and unseasonably
cool temperatures to portions of the Great Lakes, Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys, and Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...

...Heavy rain also likely from the coastal Carolinas to the
southern Appalachians Tuesday...

...Elevated risk of fire weather conditions expected in northern
Texas on Tuesday, the Central Great Basin and Northern Plains on
Wednesday...

A strong cold front extending from the Great Lakes through the
Lower Mississippi Valley will continue its slow eastward
progression today, pushed ahead by a broad area of surface high
pressure settling in over the Great Plains. Showers and
thunderstorms are forecast to develop along the length of the
front, with isolated damaging wind gusts possible from eastern
Texas to southeast Arkansas/northwest Mississippi. The heaviest
rainfall is expected along the front axis from eastern Michigan
through central Tennessee, which has been denoted to be at a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall by the Weather Prediction
Center through tomorrow morning. Fueled by an amplifying
upper-level trough and above normal atmospheric moisture,
widespread rainfall accumulations of 2", with isolated higher
amounts in the 4-6" range, will be possible and may cause
scattered flash flooding.

By Wednesday morning a low pressure center that had been tracking
north along the front is forecast to remain quasi-stationary over
Ohio as it deepens throughout the day, facilitating the
development of breezy conditions around the closed surface low. As
the trailing cold front moves into the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic,
the potential for heavy rain and isolated damaging wind gusts will
follow. Shortwave energy at the surface will allow for additional
heavy rain to fall over the Lower Great Lakes, while showers and
thunderstorms along the cold front will produce heavy rainfall
totals upwards of 3", with isolated pockets of up to 6", from the
Blue Ridge Mountains through western/central Pennsylvania. To
account for flooding potential over the already saturated soils in
the Ohio Valley and the new, very heavy rainfall over the
Mid-Atlantic the Weather Prediction Center has issued two upgraded
Moderate Risk areas for Excessive Rainfall for the aforementioned
regions valid from Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
Heavy rain is expected to continue on Thursday as the cold front
passes through the remainder of the Mid-Atlantic and approaches
New England Thursday evening. Though rainfall totals are forecast
to be lower than the previous two days, more rain on top of the
already saturated soils could cause scattered flash flooding to
occur, particularly in eastern Pennsylvania.

In addition to producing widespread heavy rainfall, the cold front
is expected to bring unseasonably cool temperatures to the areas
it passes through. On Wednesday, daily highs in Michigan, the Ohio
Valley and upper Tennessee Valley are forecast to be 10 to 20
degrees below normal, with high temperatures failing to reach 65
degrees in southern Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, and western Ohio.
Temperature departures of 10 to 15 degrees will continue for
southern Michigan and the Ohio Valley on Thursday, with daily
highs primarily in the low to mid 60s.

To the east of the cold front, onshore winds are advecting
moisture ahead of a quasi-stationary boundary to the coastal
Carolinas. Energy from an upper-level shortwave trough working in
tandem with surface instability will support heavy rain up to and
exceeding 2" from the coastline to the southern Blue Ridge
Mountains. To account for the possibility of local to scattered
flash flooding, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk for Excessive Rainfall for these regions through tomorrow
morning.

The Storm Prediction Center has forecast an elevated risk of fire
weather for northern Texas today due to the aforementioned cold
front advecting dry air into the region while producing breezy
conditions. Tomorrow this elevated risk will shift to the Central
Great Basin and Northern Plains, where downsloping winds, low
relative humidity, and dry fuels could be receptive to fire spread.

Out west, strong surface high pressure will allow dry conditions
to persist from the coast to the Great Plains throughout the
short-range period. Additionally, marginal to moderately above
normal temperatures are expected for much of the western-half of
the country on both Wednesday and Thursday.

...Heavy rainfall will slowly exit the Northeast/New England
Friday into Saturday...


...Overview...

Upper ridging over the Labrador Sea and off the West Coast into
the Great Basin will favor troughing over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low over the Southwest.
Troughing over the North Pacific this weekend will dive
southeastward early next week toward the Pacific Northwest. This
favors a mostly dry pattern once the lead eastern system moves
into Atlantic Canada and generally moderating temperatures.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

A pair of interacting closed upper level lows evolving over the
Great Lakes and Northeast later this week through the weekend will
carry a pair of fronts through the area. The lead system will
support a wrapped-up front with possible surface wave development
off the Carolinas late Fri/early Sat that may lift northward
toward the Gulf of Maine by early Sunday. Trailing upper low will
support a secondary cold front eventually reinforcing the lead
boundary and helping to move it out of the Northeast. Guidance has
wavered markedly on how to handle this interaction/dumbelling but
the latest two cycles were closer to agreement. With such a
meridional flow, considerable moisture will flow northward out of
the sub-tropics in a narrow axis into New England Friday into
Saturday as the front slowly moves eastward. Some solutions like
the 00Z UKMET were especially bullish and, though possible, will
be sensitive to the east-west sharpness of the upper trough and
degree of tilt back to the NNW.

Elsewhere, model agreement was near average outside the Southwest.
There, the 00Z/06Z GFS runs were slightly/much farther east,
respectively, than the ECMWF-led consensus and were not preferred.
Into the PacNW, the 00Z UKMET and then the Canadian departed from
the ensemble consensus with the timing/depth of the trough south
of the Gulf of Alaska though the multi-day ensemble trend was for
a sharper trough (much like the East).

The WPC preference was mainly a non-GFS blend (though it was
reasonable in the East); favored the 00Z ECMWF through the period
with some contribution from the CMC/UKMET. Trended toward an
increasing weight of the 00Z ECMWF ensemble mean and Canadian
mean. This favored well with continuity while adjusting toward the
latest trends in the guidance.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow-moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Friday into Saturday. The second system in its wake
will bring additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a
stationary/stalled frontal boundary draped across central/south
Florida will bring daily chances of diurnally-driven
thunderstorms. Much of the rest of the Lower 48 will be relatively
dry, though some isolated showers and storms will be possible
across portions of CA/NV/AZ associated with the weak closed upper
level low late this weekend into early next week.

Cooler, fall-like temperatures will prevail across the
central/eastern CONUS Friday into the weekend in the wake of the
cold frontal passages. Highs 5-10F below normal are expected while
nighttime lows up to 10F below normal are likely, particularly
across the Gulf Coast region with dew points into the 50s/60s.
Temperatures will moderate this weekend into next week. Meanwhile,
upper level ridging will promote above normal readings for the
interior western CONUS to the Plains with highs/lows about 5F to
as much as 10-15F above normal. Temperatures will trend cooler
next week in the Pacific Northwest as a lead and then more
substantial trailing cold front move into the area.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 AM CDT Wed Sep 22 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a progressive shortwave
trough approaching the Pacific Northwest from the northeastern
Pacific. This feature will be responsible for augmenting
low/mid-level winds across parts of the West, which will likely
result in areas of fire weather concerns this afternoon. Outside of
a couple of regional concerns, recent rainfall and/or weak flow
regimes will limit the potential for robust wildfire threats.

...Northwest Nevada...
The upper-level trough axis is expected to propagate over the
northern Sierra late this afternoon and phase with peak daytime
heating. As a result, strengthening flow within a deep boundary
layer will support breezy conditions at the surface in the immediate
lee of the terrain. Downslope flow will help RH values fall into the
teens, and modestly receptive fuels (ERC values above the 75th
percentile) will support elevated fire weather conditions. Elevated
wind/RH combinations may evolve across southeast OR and northern NV,
but a combination of lower ERC values, potential for
rain/thunderstorms, and higher spread in model guidance yield lower
confidence in the fire weather threat for these locations.

...Northern Montana...
Strengthening zonal flow over the Canadian Rockies ahead of the
approaching trough will help deepen a lee surface low over the
Canadian Prairies. As a result, west to southwest winds will
increase to near 15 mph across much of northern MT. RH reductions
into the 15-25% range appear likely and will support elevated fire
weather conditions given above-seasonal ERC values for some
locations. Elevated conditions are possible outside of the
highlighted area, but lower probabilities for sustained 15+ mph
winds and a similar downward trend in deterministic wind speed yield
low confidence elsewhere.

...Southern Wyoming...
Elevated wind/RH combinations are probable across parts of southern
WY this afternoon as downslope winds increase to 15-20 mph with RH
values in the teens and low 20s. However, recent ERC analyses show
many locations are near or just below seasonal values, suggesting an
overall modest fire weather threat.

...Southern Plains...
Winds across the Southern Plains are forecast to be much weaker
today compared to yesterday; however, an unseasonably dry air mass
will remain in place with RH values in the 20-25% range expected
this afternoon. Light fire activity yesterday supports the idea of
receptive fuels, and occasional 15-20 mph wind gusts may support
localized fire weather concerns.

...Heavy rainfall will slowly exit the Northeast/New England
Saturday...

...Overview...

Upper ridging over the Labrador Sea and off the West Coast into
the Great Basin will favor troughing over the Great
Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low over the Southwest.
Troughing over the North Pacific this weekend will dive
southeastward early next week toward the Pacific Northwest. This
favors a mostly dry pattern once the lead eastern system moves
into Atlantic Canada and generally moderating temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Upper level troughing will progress through the Great Lakes and
Northeast Saturday and Sunday with a couple vort maxes pushing
through. This will act to sweep a pair of cold fronts cleanly off
the coast later Sunday into Monday. Meanwhile upstream heights
building over the central/northern Plains will continue into early
next week ahead of a digging shortwave trough for the Pacific
Northwest Tuesday/Wednesday. The fast flow supports relatively dry
conditions across much of the CONUS aside from increasing moisture
for the Pacific Northwest by the middle of next week.

For the Northeast/New England, guidance has finally come together
on the timing and depth of the upper low features as they push
through the region. Earlier differences between the GFS and other
models have lessened such that a consensus approach can be used
there. For the Northwest early to mid next week, considerable
uncertainty in how the upper pattern evolves as the energy moves
onshore toward the Intermountain West by the middle of next week.
The GFS is fast and flat while the ECMWF slows and close off the
upper low over the interior West (likely tied to downstream
slowing/closing off of another low over the Great Lakes). Given
the much above normal spread, higher amounts of the ECENS/GEFS
means were used. This favored well with continuity while adjusting
toward the latest trends in the guidance.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow-moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Friday into Saturday. The second system in its wake
will bring additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a
stationary/stalled frontal boundary draped across central/south
Florida will bring daily chances of diurnally-driven
thunderstorms. Much of the rest of the Lower 48 will be relatively
dry, though some isolated showers and storms will be possible
across portions of CA/NV/AZ associated with the weak closed upper
level low late this weekend into early next week while return flow
moisture will bring increasing chances of storms to Texas by the
middle of next week.

Cooler, but still near normal temperatures will prevail across the
central/eastern U.S. this weekend in the wake of the cold front
passages. Meanwhile, as ridging aloft asserts itself across the
central U.S. and troughing develops on each coast, above normal
readings are likely with daily highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal
Sunday into next week across the central/northern Plains. A front
passing through the Northwest early next week will bring below
normal readings in its wake with highs 5 to locally 15 degrees
below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Wed Sep 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
Morning surface observations from the Canadian Prairies show weak
surface pressure falls already occurring as a lee low begins to
develop. This feature is expected to continue deepening today before
shifting eastward Thursday, funneling cold air into the northern and
central High Plains as a result. Breezy and dry conditions behind
this cold front may support a low-end fire weather concern.
Increasing southerly winds across the Southern Plains may likewise
support elevated conditions, but the probability of sustained 15+
mph winds appears too low for highlights at this time.

...Central High Plains...
Recent ensemble guidance shows reasonably high probabilities for
15-20 mph winds immediately behind the dry cold front as it shifts
southward along the High Plains. A combination of dry air advection
and a weak downslope component will likely result in widespread RH
reductions into the teens and low 20s. While elevated wind/RH
combinations appear likely, rainfall over the past 72 hours has
reduced fuel readiness for many locations. Dry conditions today may
help cure fine fuels to a degree, and highlights may be introduced
in subsequent outlooks if fuel conditions sufficiently deteriorate.

...Widespread heavy rains likely with flooding possible from the
Great Lakes to the central Appalachians on Wednesday...

...Strong to severe storms possible across the upper Ohio Valley
and central Appalachians on Wednesday...

...Heavy rain threat expected to shift farther east across the
northern Mid Atlantic on Thursday...

Widespread showers and thunderstorms will continue to fall along a
strong cold front that extends from the Great Lakes to the central
Gulf Coast on Wednesday.  A strengthening area of low pressure
will move northeastward along the front from the lower Ohio Valley
into the Great Lakes -- supporting gusty winds and heavy rains
across the region.  As a very moist airmass surges north into the
region, widespread heavy rainfall accumulations are likely, with
several inches possible in some locations from Indiana and Lower
Michigan to the central Appalachians on Wednesday into early
Thursday.  Localized to widespread flooding is possible, with
flood and flash flood watches currently in effect for portions of
the region.  In addition to the heavy rains, scattered strong to
severe thunderstorms, producing damaging winds and perhaps a few
tornadoes, are possible as well -- especially across the upper
Ohio Valley and the central Appalachians Wednesday afternoon into
the evening hours.

As the low begins to track across the Great Lakes into southern
Ontario, the front will slowly push farther east -- shifting the
focus for heavier rains into the northern Mid Atlantic region on
Thursday.

Behind the front, high pressure and dry conditions are expected to
prevail across the Plains through Thursday.  Farther west, a weak
cold front is expected bring some cooler temperatures and a chance
for light precipitation as it moves across the Northwest into the
northern Rockies on Wednesday.

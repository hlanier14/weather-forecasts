...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move across the Inter-mountain West during
the day, promoting surface low development and subsequent dry and
breezy westerly flow across portions of southern California, into
Arizona, New Mexico and the southern High Plains. While much of the
aforementioned areas may experience Elevated to locally Critical
conditions by afternoon peak heating, fuels remain largely
un-receptive to significant wildfire-spread. Cooler and moister
conditions across the central and eastern U.S. will hamper
significant wildfire concerns as well.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 24 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is forecast to expand across the eastern
half
of the contiguous U.S. during week-2 favoring increased chances for above
normal temperatures for most areas east of the Rockies. Precipitation chanc=
es
will be generally limited to transient weak surface lows and accompanying
frontal systems. Mid-level low pressure is favored across Alaska and the
eastern Pacific leading to increased chances for below normal temperatures
over
Alaska and the western contiguous U.S.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of western Mainl=
and
Alaska, Thu-Mon, Mar 4-8.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 27 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 03:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!qRWHYAGneaZIOuBQ4A1qLpO-3_mdl0YH7HEUIOajLXDwxHYsAI1Hp-dFHb-r6=
Z4inMy3mNZr$

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 04 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 10: Following a negative phase of t=
he
Arctic Oscillation (AO) since early December, a transition to a positive AO
occurred during mid-February. Nearly all the 0z GFS ensemble members mainta=
in
a
positive phase of the AO into mid-March. This positive AO, along with
anomalous
500-hPa ridging expanding north over the central and eastern U.S., favors n=
ear
to above normal temperatures for the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS during
week-2. Although the CPC week-2 outlook features increased chances of below
normal temperatures across the West as a result of increased troughing in t=
he
East Pacific, these temperatures are not expected to be hazardous as spring
draws closer.



The most anomalous cold during early March is forecast to be limited to the
highest latitudes of western North America, including Alaska. Both the GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate that minimum temperatures have at least a 4=
0
percent chance of falling below the 10th percentile of the climatological
distribution across parts of western Mainland Alaska on 3/4. Thereafter,
probabilities for hazardous cold substantially decrease in the ECMWF tool, =
but
remain above 20 percent in the GEFS tool, which depicts more amplified
troughing building back over the state by the middle of week-2. A slight ri=
sk
of much below normal temperatures is highlighted for parts of western Mainl=
and
Alaska for 3/4-3/8 with minimum temperatures possibly falling below -20 deg=
 F
over some areas. The synoptic pattern across Alaska favors an active storm
track across the Bering Sea and into southern portions of Alaska, bringing
enhanced precipitation chances, along with episodes of high wind speeds to =
the
Aleuitans and southwestern Mainland coast. However, any impacts are forecas=
t
to
be intermittent, and likely to remain below hazards thresholds.



Troughing is forecast to shift from the East Pacific into the western CONUS
during week-2. As a result, onshore flow along the West Coast may increase
early in the period resulting in enhanced chances for precipitation (coasta=
l
rain and high elevation snow). However, the precipitation totals are foreca=
st
to remain below hazards criteria. This trough may also promote surface low
pressure to eject out of the Rockies bringing increased precipitation chanc=
es
farther east to the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, with the GEFS
reforecast tool depicting a wetter forecast over these areas compared to th=
e

...Heavy rain threat continues from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend into early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles continue to advertise a heightened chance for
a heavy rain event to extend across the Mid-South as we begin the
medium range period this weekend.  The heavy rain area will remain
sandwiched between a strong upper ridge across the southern Gulf
of Mexico and broad upper-level cyclonic flow dipping into the
northern tier states.  This will tend to prolong the threat of
heavy rain in the same general area from the southern Plains to
the Tennessee Valley and towards the southern Appalachians into
early next week.

Models have been relatively consistent in placing the heavy rain
axis through much of the event from this weekend into early next
week, although there has been a tendency to extend the heavy rain
farther east into the southern Appalachians.  A general model
compromise together with the WPC ensemble biased-corrected QPF was
used to create the medium-range QPF field.  As we head beyond Day
5, there is a general model signal to gradually push the moisture
eastward into the Southeast as the heavy rain threat diminishes
across the Deep South beginning on Tuesday.  By Wednesday, much of
the rain could be heading off the coast of the southeastern U.S.
There is some indication for a low pressure wave to form near the
central Gulf around this time frame.  The ECMWF tracks this system
across the East Coast.  This scenario is not supported by the EC
ensemble mean, the GEFS and the CMC mean however.

The WPC medium-range package was derived based on the consensus of
the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean with more of the ensemble
means on day 6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty. This
resulted in a blend that lied reasonably close to continuity.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Precipitation spreading into portions of the central to northern
Rockies could result in heavy snow for the higher elevations.
Meanwhile, upper level troughing across the Four Corners region
will allow Gulf moisture to lift northward as waves of low
pressure rides along a slow-moving front. This setup will favor a
few rounds of locally heavy rainfall this weekend into early next
week across portions of the Arklatex to the TN and OH Valleys. The
latest guidance shows the possibility of general rainfall totaling
several inches over the period.

Farther north, some wintry precipitation can be expected across
the upper Great Lakes early on Saturday, across the Midwest on
Sunday and Sunday night, and across northern New England Monday
and Monday night.  Another round of wintry weather is possible
across the Midwest to the Ohio Valley Monday to Tuesday.

Below normal temperatures are expected to remain primarily over
the Northern Rockies to start the period with departures of 10F to
as much as 20F Saturday while the eastern half of the CONUS
experiences slightly above normal daytime highs. Ahead of the
stationary boundary expected to be draped across portions of the
South, daytime highs as much as 15F above normal are possible
Sunday along the Gulf Coast as well as portions of the Northeast
and New England. Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above
normal (10 to 20F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday
and Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS
River Valley to Great Lakes.

Cooler temps return to the Southern Plains and Northeast, warmer
conditions along the Gulf Coast...

...New Pacific storm delivers rain and mountain snow to the
Northwest...

...Stalled frontal boundary to trigger showers and thunderstorms

An area of low pressure is forecast to produce areas of snow
across northern New England this evening as it approaches from the
eastern Great Lakes. Snow may linger into Thursday morning in
these areas as a cold front ushers in a shot of colder
temperatures. In total, snow accumulations should be on the light
side but a stripe of 4 to 8 inches in northern Maine is possible.
The aforementioned cold front leads to colder temps pushing south
into the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday following a seasonably mild day
today. The colder temperatures will also return across the
Southern Plains and Ohio Valley on Thursday with the coldest
anomalies (roughly 15 to 25 degrees below normal) centered over
the southern High Plains. Temperatures from the South Central U.S.
to the Northeast should moderate to more seasonally cool levels by
Friday while highs in the 70s set up shop along the Gulf Coast.
Some parts of Florida could see highs even soar into the 80s for
the end of the week.

In the West, a Pacific storm system pumps Pacific moisture into
the Northwest leading to an unsettled couple of days throughout
the region. Periods of rain are likely tonight into Thursday in
the lower lying areas of the Northwest while copious amounts of
snow pile up in the higher elevations of the Cascades, Olympics,
and the northern Rockies. After the primary storm system advances
east on Friday, lingering upslope flow and access to Pacific
moisture will keep in the forecast into the start of the weekend.
Winter Storm Watches are in place for portions of these mountain
ranges as snowfall is forecast to be measured in feet in some of
these locations. In addition, strong winds return to western
Montana on Thursday where High Wind Warnings are in place due to
wind gusts surpassing 50 mph are likely. Avalanche warnings also
continue in parts of the northern Rockies through Thursday
morning. Lastly, parts of the central Rockies and High Plains will
be blanketed in snow tonight into Thursday with amounts up to a
foot possible along the front range of the Colorado Rockies.

Across the South, a frontal boundary will come to a halt along
over the Gulf Coast states on Thursday. This boundary acts as a
trigger for scattered showers and thunderstorms on Thursday.
Precipitation rates begin to ramp up in intensity Thursday night
as an upper trough approaches from the southern High Plains. In
fact, some thunderstorms could become severe across the South
Central U.S. late Thursday where a Marginal Risk for severe
weather is in place. The large swath of showers and thunderstorms
advances east into the Deep South where locally heavy rainfall and
strong storms could transpire. By Friday evening, precipitation
works its way into the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic with some
mountain snow and wintry mix possible in the southern and central
Appalachians.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 02 - 06 2021

Today's model forecasts are in general agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period but show increasing differences and ensemble spread. Most
ensemble model solutions predict a low amplitude 500-hPa trough in the
vicinity
of western North America. However, the ECMWF ensemble mean predicts split f=
low
over the western CONUS with a shortwave trough over the Southwest and a low
amplitude trough off of the coast, while the GEFS predicts a slightly more
amplified trough over the West Coast. Enhanced westerly flow continues to b=
e
predicted across the Aleutian Islands and into southwestern Mainland Alaska
around a trough with a negative height anomaly to the north and a positive
height anomaly to the south. A ridge is predicted over the eastern CONUS in
most model solutions, with weaker positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the
ECMWF ensemble mean than those in the GEFS ensemble mean, and some troughin=
g
over the Northeast in the ECMWF ensemble mean. The manual height blend depi=
cts
negative 500-hPa height anomalies over most of Alaska except the western
Aleutians. Near zero 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the wester=
n
CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted across the easte=
rn
CONUS.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across Alaska excep=
t
for the western Aleutians, under negative 500-hPa height anomalies. Below
normal temperatures are likely over the Pacific coastal states of the CONUS
extending to the Northern Rockies, related to weak troughing over the regio=
n.
Above normal temperatures are likely over much of the central and eastern
CONUS
east of the Rocky Mountains, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies, while
near normal temperatures are favored over the Northeast, with increased
uncertainty due to potential troughing in the ECMWF model forecasts.

Above normal precipitation is likely across Alaska, excluding the North Slo=
pe,
under enhanced westerly flow. Below normal precipitation is favored for muc=
h
of
the northern central CONUS, from eastern areas of Nevada, Oregon and
Washington
across the Northern Plains and Great Lakes region, with weakening troughing
near to the Southwest CONUS and ridging over the northern central CONUS. Ab=
ove
normal precipitation is slightly favored from the Central Mississippi Valle=
y
across the Tennessee Valley into the Mid-Atlantic states and parts of the
Southeast, due to the potential emergence of shortwaves ahead of the trough=
ing
over the southwestern CONUS. Chances of below  normal precipitation are
enhanced for parts of the wesetrn Gulf Coast, consistent with most dynamica=
l
model forecasts.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 1=
0%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by
differences among temperature and precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 04 - 10 2021

There is continued increased spread among dynamical model solutions for the
8-14 day period, however the main features of the predicted circulation
pattern
for the 6-10 day period persist into the week 2 period in the manual blend.
Enhanced westerly flow between a positive height anomaly to the south and a
negative height anomaly to the north persists into southwestern Alaska. A w=
eak
trough and slightly below normal 500-hPa heights are depicted over the
northwestern CONUS in the week 2 manual blend of model forecasts with
increasing heights over the Southwest. Ridging and weak positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies persist over the eastern CONUS into week 2.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is also similar to t=
he
6-10 day period forecast with some notable changes. Enhanced probabilities =
of
below normal temperatures are indicated for the Alaska Mainland, under
negative
500-hPa height anomalies. Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatur=
es
are also shown for the western CONUS over a similar region as in the 6-10 d=
ay
period, due to the trough over the Northwest. Above normal temperatures are
favored over most of the central and eastern CONUS, as in the 6-10 day peri=
od
forecast, with the addition of enhanced probabilities of above normal
temperatures over much of eastern Arizona and New Mexico, under positive
500-hPa height anomalies. Probabilities of above normal temperatures exceed=
 50
percent over the Northern Plains and the Great Lakes region under anomalous
southerly flow. There were considerable differences among model temperature
forecasts for much of the Southern Plains and the Southeast, so only weak
probabilities of above normal temperatures were indicated for these regions=
,
supported by analog forecasts and positive 500-hPa height anomalies.

Enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are favored over all o=
f
Alaska except the North Slope in week 2, under persistent westerly mid-leve=
l
flow. The precipitation pattern forecast over the CONUS in week 2 shows som=
e
changes relative to the 6-10 day period forecast. Above normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored over coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest, ahead of a trough. Bel=
ow
normal precipitation is favored over parts of the eastern Great Basin acros=
s
the Southern Rockies and over most of the Great Plains states, outside
climatologically dry areas of the Southwest, under weak ridging. Slightly
enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are depicted across mu=
ch
of the Midwest, as well as the Great Lakes region, and parts of the Northea=
st,
with potential for precipitation under anomalous southerly flow. Below norm=
al
precipitation is favored for the Gulf Coast states and southern Atlantic Co=
ast
states, supported by most dynamical model forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Heavy rain threat continues from the southern Plains to the
Tennessee Valley this weekend into early next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensembles continue to advertise a heightened chance for
a heavy rain event to extend across the Mid-South as we begin the
medium range period this weekend.  The heavy rain area will remain
sandwiched between a strong upper ridge across the southern Gulf
of Mexico and broad upper-level cyclonic flow dipping into the
northern tier states.  This will tend to prolong the threat of
heavy rain in the same general area from the southern Plains to
the Tennessee Valley and towards the southern Appalachians into
early next week.

Models have been relatively consistent in placing the heavy rain
axis through much of the event from this weekend into early next
week, although there has been a tendency to extend the heavy rain
farther east into the southern Appalachians.  A general model
compromise together with the WPC ensemble biased-corrected QPF was
used to create the medium-range QPF field.  As we head beyond Day
5, there is a general model signal to gradually push the moisture
eastward into the Southeast as the heavy rain threat diminishes
across the Deep South beginning on Tuesday.  By Wednesday, much of
the rain could be heading off the coast of the southeastern U.S.
There is some indication for a low pressure wave to form near the
central Gulf around this time frame.  The ECMWF tracks this system
across the East Coast.  This scenario is not supported by the EC
ensemble mean, the GEFS and the CMC mean however.

The WPC medium-range package was derived based on the consensus of
the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and smaller
contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean with more of the ensemble
means on day 6-7 to account for the forecast uncertainty. This
resulted in a blend that lied reasonably close to continuity.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Precipitation spreading into portions of the central to northern
Rockies could result in heavy snow for the higher elevations.
Meanwhile, upper level troughing across the Four Corners region
will allow Gulf moisture to lift northward as waves of low
pressure rides along a slow-moving front. This setup will favor a
few rounds of locally heavy rainfall this weekend into early next
week across portions of the Arklatex to the TN and OH Valleys. The
latest guidance shows the possibility of general rainfall totaling
several inches over the period.

Farther north, some wintry precipitation can be expected across
the upper Great Lakes early on Saturday, across the Midwest on
Sunday and Sunday night, and across northern New England Monday
and Monday night.  Another round of wintry weather is possible
across the Midwest to the Ohio Valley Monday to Tuesday.

Below normal temperatures are expected to remain primarily over
the Northern Rockies to start the period with departures of 10F to
as much as 20F Saturday while the eastern half of the CONUS
experiences slightly above normal daytime highs. Ahead of the
stationary boundary expected to be draped across portions of the
South, daytime highs as much as 15F above normal are possible
Sunday along the Gulf Coast as well as portions of the Northeast
and New England. Nighttime lows are forecast to be well above
normal (10 to 20F) for much of the central and eastern U.S. Sunday
and Monday, ahead of the frontal boundary draped through the MS
River Valley to Great Lakes.

232 AM EST Thu Feb 25 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Feb 25 2021 - 12Z Sat Feb 27 2021

...Lingering snow showers in northern New England this morning;
Cooler temps return to the Southern Plains while Gulf coast warms
up...

...Pacific storm to deliver rain and mountain snow to the
Northwest...

...Stalled frontal boundary to initiate showers and thunderstorms
from the Southern Plains to the Southeast...

Dual frontal systems out over the Canadian meritime will continue
off into the northern Atlantic today. These systems will produce
lingering snow showers across northern New England this morning
before coming to an end. Winter Storm Warnings and Advisories
remain in effect for parts of northern Maine. Temperatures are
expected to drop after the second of the two frontal systems
passes through the area this evening. Temperatures are expected to
plunge across much of the Carolinas tomorrow as an area of high
pressure moves into the Ohio Valley and filters cold air down into
the southern Mid-Atlantic. Today, a cold airmass will descend over
the Southern Plains from the Rockies. High temperatures are likely
to be between 20-30 degrees below average. Conversely, parts of
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will experience a warm-up
through Friday.

A low pressure system and general troughing will bring rain to the
low elevations and coasts as well as heavy snow to the mountains
of the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies through Friday. The
heaviest amounts may occur over the northern Cascades where
snowfall totals will likely be measured in feet. Winter Storm
Warnings, Advisories and Watches are in effect for these areas as
a result. An Avalanche Warning is in effect for parts of the
Montana/Idaho Rockies. High wind warnings are in effect across the
foothills of the Northern Rockies in Montana due to the tightening
pressure gradient out ahead of the approaching system.

The southern portion of the Atlantic system will stall out across
the Gulf coast and Southeast over the next two days. This will
lead to the development of rain and scattered thunderstorms across
an area extending from the Southern Plains to the Southeast during
this time, while temperatures warm up to the south of the
boundary. Interaction from the Pacific system and a northern
stream disturbance over southern Canada will contribute to the
expansion of rain over the Mid-Atlantic and light snow to the
Central Appalachians and much of the Northeast by Saturday.

0139 AM CST Thu Feb 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper pattern will be in place today, with a mid-level
trough rapidly progressing across the south-central CONUS as a
second trough aloft traverses the Interior West. Moist low-level
conditions and precipitation will accompany the south-central CONUS
trough, limiting wildfire-spread concerns across the southern Plains
eastward. Meanwhile, surface high pressure across the Central
Rockies northward will promote cool conditions, mitigating
wildfire-spread potential. A pressure gradient is expected to be in
place across southern California at the start of the period,
accompanied by strong, dry offshore flow. Dry westerly surface flow
is also expected across portions of southern Arizona into New
Mexico. However, poor fuel receptiveness to wildfire spread across
the southwest CONUS precludes any fire weather highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 AM CST Thu Feb 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper pattern will continue from Day 1 to Day
2/Friday, as an upper trough ejects into the Upper Mississippi
Valley while a second trough aloft deepens over the Interior West.
Low-level moisture return will impinge on the southern to eastern
CONUS, limiting the potential for significant wildfire spread.
Across the central/southern High Plains southwestward into Arizona
and New Mexico, dry downslope flow aided by the aforementioned upper
troughing may encourage the development of Elevated to locally
Critical surface wind/RH conditions by afternoon peak heating.
However, fuel receptiveness to wildfire spread is expected to remain
mediocre across much of the southwest into the central CONUS, with
no fire weather highlights introduced.

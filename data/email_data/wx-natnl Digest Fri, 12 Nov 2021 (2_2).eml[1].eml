...Snow and high winds over the northern Plains/upper Midwest
gradually subside today as locally heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms move across the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...

...Flash flooding potential to continue over the Pacific Northwest
into early Saturday as onslaught of heavy rainfall continues...

...An Alberta clipper will deliver another around of snow/rain and
gusty winds across the northern Plains Saturday into early
Sunday...

A large and energetic low pressure system that has brought snow
and high winds across the northern Plains and upper Midwest will
steadily weaken today as it moves across the Great Lakes and
retreats into Canada tonight.  Nevertheless, very strong and gusty
winds on the back side of this system will initially bring blowing
snow and reduced visibility over portions of the northern Plains
early this morning before conditions steadily improve later today.
 In the mean time, a strong cold front associated with this
energetic system will sweep through the eastern U.S. today with
locally heavy rain and embedded strong thunderstorms.  These
storms may lead to local flooding issues later today across New
England.

Shifting focus out west, persistent onshore flow from a modest
atmospheric river will continue to bring moderate to heavy
rainfall into portions of the Pacific Northwest.  Another 2-4
inches of rain have been forecast for the region over the next 24
hours and rainfall rates over some areas may be as high as
0.5-0.75 inches per hour.  Given the already saturated soils from
the previous days' rain and the concern for the development of
rapid run-off and urban flooding, the Weather Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of the
Pacific Northwest through Friday morning.  The threat of heavy
rain is forecast to diminish later tonight as the main energy
penetrates further inland to support a anew low pressure center
over Albert Canada.

In the Central/Southern Plains, dry and breezy conditions
coinciding with low values of relative humidity has prompted the
issuance of an Elevated Risk of fire weather by the Storm
Prediction Center through Saturday morning, as these conditions
could allow any fires that ignite to spread rapidly.

Temperature-wise, daily highs across much of the country are
forecast to sit near or moderately (within 10 degrees) above
normal. However, for those areas that find themselves to the
west/southwest of the occluded low pressure system the opposite
holds true. Significant cold air advection behind the system,
aided by the cut off low aloft, will force temperatures to drop
well below normal behind a cold front set to develop across the
central US this evening. On Friday the Central Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley will be hit the hardest as highs are expected
to fall into the 30s and 40s, around 10 to 15 degrees below
normal. As the Plains warm up on Saturday with the advancement of
a warm front through the region, cooler temperatures are expected
to settle into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys with the eastward
progression of the cold front. With temperatures sitting 10 to 20
degrees below normal, daily highs in these areas will be unable to
escape the 40s and 50s.

Chillier and drier air will advance into the East Coast tonight
behind the strong cold front.  However, a reinforcing cold front
will quickly spread a mix of rain and snow from across the Great
Lakes through the Appalachians on Saturday and then across New
England Saturday night with gusty winds.  Strong winds west to
northwest winds behind this front will usher in colder air through
the eastern U.S. Saturday night.

Meanwhile, persistent onshore flow from a modest atmospheric river
will continue to bring moderate to heavy rainfall into portions of
the Pacific Northwest.  Another 2-4 inches of rain have been
forecast for the region over the next 24 hours and rainfall rates

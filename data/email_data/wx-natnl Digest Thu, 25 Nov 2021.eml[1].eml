Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1009 AM CST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

The previous forecast for both southern California and the High
Plains remains on track, with only minor adjustments made to the
fire weather highlights to reflect the latest guidance consensus.
Across southern California, offshore flow has commenced, with the
LAX to DAG/WJF observed pressure gradient(s) increasing to Elevated
magnitudes. This pressure gradient is expected to strengthen through
the day, with offshore flow ushering in drier air, supporting
Critical conditions late this afternoon into the overnight period.

A cold front continues to sag southward across the Plains states
this morning. Despite cloudy skies and surface temperatures
struggling to reach 60F, latest surface observations show 15-30 mph
sustained north-northwesterly winds amid 20-25% RH following
immediately behind the cold front. Elevated highlights have been
continued for areas across the central/southern High Plains, where
Elevated equivalent surface conditions are expected to overlap
modestly dry fuels at least a couple of hours behind the cold front.

..Squitieri.. 11/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Wed Nov 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, evident in water vapor satellite imagery this
morning over the Great Basin, is forecast to move eastward
throughout the day and become more positively tilted.  Meanwhile, a
northeast-southwest oriented upper-level ridge is forecast to
develop over the West in the wake of the departing trough.  At the
surface, low pressure in the vicinity of the Great Lakes will weaken
while an associated cold front will push southward and eastward
across the southern Plains.  In the West, high pressure will build
into the Great Basin, increasing the pressure gradient across
Southern California.

...Portions of Southern California...
As the pressure gradient increases across the region, offshore winds
will increase by late morning.  Downslope processes will aid in
warming and drying, resulting in critical fire weather conditions
beginning around noon local time.  Beginning around this time, winds
aloft will also increase significantly from the northeast, lending
upper-level support to the offshore flow regime.  This upper-level
support will continue through the evening and overnight hours,
likely enhancing gusts to over 60 mph in favored terrain locations.
Given the continued strong offshore flow, RH recovery will be very
poor overnight, resulting in continuous critical fire weather
conditions for many locations through the night into Thursday
morning.

...Portions of Southern High Plains...
Strong northerly winds of 15-20 mph are forecast in the wake of a
cold-frontal passage across the southern High Plains.  Given the dry
airmass in place, critical RH values are also likely to be
concurrent with these strong winds, elevating fire weather
conditions.  Given the eventual cooling and moistening behind the
front, elevated fire weather conditions will progress
south-southeastward through the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
203 PM EST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 27 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021

...Overview...

The upper level pattern this weekend into early next week is
forecast to be amplified and fairly stagnant with troughing in the
East and ridging in the West, with the exception of southern
stream energy tracking across northern Mexico and Texas while
weakening and eventually getting absorbed into the Eastern trough.
A couple of shortwaves should initially help reinforce the Eastern
trough, while by Tuesday-Wednesday additional shortwaves coming
into the north-central U.S. may flatten the overall upper pattern
a bit, but with some uncertainty.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for the large
scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in the
details. Energy reloading through the western side of the trough
in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show slight timing and
magnitude differences, which affects a surface low deepening off
the Northeast coast. For the 00/06Z model cycle, the ensemble
means clustered well with the surface low position around day
5/Monday, and were aligned most closely to the 00Z ECMWF and CMC
and 06Z GFS, so the WPC forecast mainly favored this position,
which was close to continuity. The 00Z GFS and UKMET were farther
west/closer to the coast comparatively, and the new 12Z GFS is now
showing a double barreled low situation with a low closer to the
coast and one to the east, while the 12Z GEFS mean is slightly
westward. Meanwhile the incoming 12Z ECWMF is farther south
(around the latitude of the NC/VA border) with its low position
Monday morning before jumping north toward other guidance, again
showing uncertainty. The placement of this surface low will have
impacts for the Northeast including how much precipitation falls,
so this will continue to be monitored.

Despite some differences, consensus now shows troughing in the
East lifting somewhat on Tuesday into Wednesday. This occurs as
shortwave energy from central Canada that in some prior model runs
served to strengthen the preexisting trough, as well as a
shortwave coming into the Pacific Northwest around day 5/Monday
and propagating downstream, now for the most part appear to stay
separated from the Eastern troughing. Differences certainly remain
with the timing and position of these shortwaves. WPC's blend for
this area and for the latter half of the medium range period
consisted of the deterministic 06Z GFS, ECWMF, and CMC as well as
the GEFS and EC mean, which admittedly washes out some shortwaves
but seems to be the best bet to smooth out differences considering
run-to-run variability.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A plume of moisture/atmospheric river is forecast to take aim at
western Canada and into Washington on Saturday, north of a low
amplitude ridge. Precipitation should remain mostly rain even in
higher elevations for this event due to the warm temperatures,
with heaviest totals likely along favorable terrain. Lighter
precipitation is forecast to continue in the Pacific Northwest and
into the Northern Rockies through early next week, before another
round of heavier precipitation is likely for the Pacific Northwest
around Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile, light precipitation is
possible with energy moving through the base of the trough for the
Midwest/Great Lakes and possibly the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic.
Precipitation (including some snow) could be enhanced downwind of
the Great Lakes and in higher elevations, and possibly in eastern
New England on the backside of the Atlantic surface low. A couple
of rounds of light rain are possible in Texas, while much of the
rest of the country looks to remain dry.

The mean trough over the East should keep temperatures below
normal through Monday with some moderation back towards normal on
Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile, amplified ridging will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains with several
days of +15 to +25 anomalies (locally higher) likely, especially
across parts of the northern and central Plains Sunday and Monday
and again on Wednesday.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
203 PM EST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 27 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021

...Overview...

The upper level pattern this weekend into early next week is
forecast to be amplified and fairly stagnant with troughing in the
East and ridging in the West, with the exception of southern
stream energy tracking across northern Mexico and Texas while
weakening and eventually getting absorbed into the Eastern trough.
A couple of shortwaves should initially help reinforce the Eastern
trough, while by Tuesday-Wednesday additional shortwaves coming
into the north-central U.S. may flatten the overall upper pattern
a bit, but with some uncertainty.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for the large
scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in the
details. Energy reloading through the western side of the trough
in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show slight timing and
magnitude differences, which affects a surface low deepening off
the Northeast coast. For the 00/06Z model cycle, the ensemble
means clustered well with the surface low position around day
5/Monday, and were aligned most closely to the 00Z ECMWF and CMC
and 06Z GFS, so the WPC forecast mainly favored this position,
which was close to continuity. The 00Z GFS and UKMET were farther
west/closer to the coast comparatively, and the new 12Z GFS is now
showing a double barreled low situation with a low closer to the
coast and one to the east, while the 12Z GEFS mean is slightly
westward. Meanwhile the incoming 12Z ECWMF is farther south
(around the latitude of the NC/VA border) with its low position
Monday morning before jumping north toward other guidance, again
showing uncertainty. The placement of this surface low will have
impacts for the Northeast including how much precipitation falls,
so this will continue to be monitored.

0127 PM CST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

The latest guidance consensus continues to show the offshore flow
event across southern California peaking in magnitude tomorrow
(Thursday), with high-end Critical conditions expected. By
morning/early afternoon, 30-40 mph sustained northeasterly surface
winds are expected to coincide with 10% RH for at least a few hours,
particularly in terrain-favoring areas from the San Gabriel to
Laguna Mountains. Consideration was given to adding Extremely
Critical highlights. However, fuel receptiveness (while approaching
critically dry status) is not overly robust enough to warrant an
upgrade to Extremely Critical at this time.

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track for portions of
the High Plains, with no changes or additions made to fire weather
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 11/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CST Wed Nov 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, a closed midlevel low is forecast to develop off of
Baja California, as the northern portion of the upper-level trough
pushes eastward across the Great Lakes Region.  At the surface, high
pressure over the Great Basin will slowly weaken throughout the day.

...Portions of Southern California...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected to be ongoing at the
beginning of the period on Thursday, as the offshore pressure
gradient peaks.  Despite a gradual weakening of the pressure
gradient throughout the rest of the day, critical fire weather
conditions will persist and expand southward in conjunction with the
movement of the upper-level support (i.e., enhanced northeasterly
flow aloft).  Although the peak wind gusts may weaken throughout the
day, gusts of 40-50 mph will still be possible in favored locations
in conjunction with widespread single-digit RH values in the
afternoon.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Although high temperatures are forecast to remain relatively cool
(40s to low 50s F), a very dry airmass and enhanced
westerly-to-northwesterly flow aloft will likely lead to elevated
fire weather conditions.  Boundary-layer heating and mixing are
likely to yield afternoon RH values around 15% and sustained winds
approaching 20 mph. Dry fuels (ERC and 100-hour fuel moisture values
near the 90th percentile) and lack of recent rainfall support
elevated fire weather concerns.

anticipated to bring increased chances for much below normal temperatures
across the Alaska Mainland. Mid-level low pressure and enhanced Pacific
onshore
flow is expected to promote above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation o=
ver
portions of the western contiguous U.S during the middle to later portion o=
f
week-2.  East of the Rockies, more tranquil conditions are favored for the
lower 48 during week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the western
Alaskan Mainland, Thu-Sun, Dec 2-5.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest and
northern California, Sun-Wed, Dec 5-8.

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 02 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 08: Following the predicted
break-down of a 500-hPa blocking ridge to the south of Greenland during
week-1,
a more transitional mid-level pattern is favored over North America heading
into December. It appears the dynamical models have been struggling with th=
is
pattern change since earlier this week, as evidenced by several run-to-run
discontinuities and disagreements in the ensemble means, contributing to
uncertainty in the hazards outlook. By the outset of the period, both the 0=
z
GEFS and 0z ECMWF height forecasts now feature positive 500-hPa height
departures throughout the western and central CONUS, with much of the
anomalous
troughing confined to the higher latitudes of western North America. As a
result, much of the enhanced Pacific onshore flow that had been previously
forecast over the West Coast of the U.S. is now favored farther north over
Canada early in the period. However, wetter mean solutions are evident in t=
he
ensemble means tied to more mid-level troughing shifting southward from the
Gulf of Alaska later in the period. This is reflected in the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools which show at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches (1 inch) over
portions
of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California. Thus, the slight risk of
heavy precipitation remains posted for the region, but is now valid from da=
y
11
to 14 (Dec 5-8). Over the Northern Rockies, reforecast tools are less
supportive of precipitation amounts exceeding hazard thresholds in the regi=
on,
and the corresponding slight risk area is removed in the outlook. Elevated
sustained high winds remain possible across the northwestern CONUS associat=
ed
with surface low pressure formation favored across the Canadian Prairies ea=
rly
in the period. However, there are reduced probabilities in the reforecast
guidance for winds exceeding the 85th percentile compared to previous
guidance,
thus the slight risk of high winds is also removed in today's outlook.



East of the Rockies, the ECMWF ensemble favors surface low formation and
frontal activity over the northeastern CONUS tied to the development of
mid-level troughing across the central CONUS early in the period by Day 10
(Dec
4) . With surface high pressure also forecast over the western Atlantic, wh=
ich
is conducive for an enhanced moisture feed, the ECMWF reforecast tool depic=
ts
increased chances for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile
over the northeastern CONUS associated with this predicted surface feature.
Although the 0z and 6z GEFS mid-level height fields have become better alig=
ned
with the ECMWF with respect to the development of anomalous troughing compa=
red
to previous guidance, it maintains a more eastward and later mean solution
than
the ECMWF, with a weaker mean surface low and little lower-level return flo=
w,
resulting in lower precipitation totals through the middle of period. Given
these continued disparities in the ensemble guidance, and a lack of support
from both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools for precipitation amounts
exceeding hazard thresholds, no precipitation related hazards are posted.
While
cold air advection appears likely on the backside of the surface lows, mini=
mum
temperatures are not expected to reach hazards criteria.



Over Alaska, prevailing mid-level northerly flow from the Bering Sea is
anticipated to promote below normal temperatures across the state. A slight
risk of much below normal temperatures is posted across portions of the
western
Mainland where reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below -20 degrees (F)
through the middle period. Beyond this time, a moderation of temperatures i=
s
anticipated as the mid-level pattern is favored to become more zonal.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southern Plains through Thanksgiving morning...

...Snow for the Upper Great Lakes into the higher elevations of
New England through Friday evening...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over the Western
Gulf Coast and parts of the Pacific Northwest from Thanksgiving
into Friday morning...

...Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains...

A front extending from the Upper Great Lakes southwestward to
Southern Plain will move eastward off the East Coast and southward
off most of the Gulf Coast by Friday evening. However, moisture
from the Western Gulf of Mexico will stream northward ahead of the
front over parts of the Southern Plains into Thanksgiving evening.
As a result, rain will develop along the front late Wednesday
night from parts of Michigan's Lower Peninsula to Arkansas.
Showers and thunderstorms will also develop along and ahead of the
front over parts of the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley
on early Thanksgiving morning into the evening and retreat to the
Western Gulf Coast overnight Thanksgiving. The rain associated
with the thunderstorms will be heavy at times. Therefore, the WPC
has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southern Plains through Thanksgiving morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Furthermore, light snow will develop over the Upper Great Lakes
overnight Wednesday and expand over Michigan's Lower Peninsula on
Thanksgiving.  As the system moves eastward overnight
Thanksgiving, light snow will develop over the Lower Great Lakes
and into the Central Appalachians, then expanding into the higher
elevations of New England by Friday morning. Additionally, the
snowfall amounts will be higher near the Lakes and the snow will
end over the Upper Great Lakes by Friday evening. The snow will
result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Meanwhile, the strong flow off the Gulf of Mexico will produce
areas of rain, heavy at times over the Western Gulf Coast on
Thanksgiving through Friday morning.  Additionally, onshore flow
off the Pacific ahead of the next system to impact the Pacific
Northwest will produce rain over parts of the Northwest, which
will be heavy at times.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Pacific Northwest and
the Western Gulf Coast Thanksgiving through Friday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

Elsewhere, much of the Southern California Coast is under Red Flag
Warnings through Friday due to ongoing Santa Ana winds. In
addition, the Storm Prediction Center has issued Critical Risk for
fire weather conditions through Friday for Southern California.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 30 - DEC 04, 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging near the western Aleutians is forecast, leading to anticipat=
ed
troughing downstream across Alaska. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to =
the
south across the western and central CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted alo=
ng
the Eastern Seaboard with below normal 500-hPa heights over the Northeast.

Troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across most of the state. Ridging over the western and central
CONUS in the period favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast to
the
Mississippi Valley. Conversely, troughing over the Eastern Seaboard leads t=
o
increased chances of below normal temperatures for the Northeast and Florid=
a
Peninsula.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above-normal
precipitation for parts of the Northwest extending to the Northern Rockies =
and
Northern Plains. Ridging and surface high pressure are expected in the peri=
od
across much of the remainder of the CONUS, favoring below normal
precipitation.
An exception is for parts of southern Texas, where above normal precipitati=
on
chances are slightly elevated ahead of a weak trough forecast over northern
Mexico. Above normal precipitation is likely for much of eastern Alaska, ah=
ead
of mean surface low pressure predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore fl=
ow
to the northwest of this low leads to increased chances of below normal
precipitation across western Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
good
agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the period=
,
offset by substantially increased uncertainty later in the period associate=
d
with a potential pattern change.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 02 - 08 2021

The potential for a pattern change and associated substantial uncertainty
exists for the week-2 period. The AO and NAO indices are both forecast by t=
he
GEFS to switch from negative to positive. In the period, agreement is fairl=
y
good among the models with troughs predicted across Alaska and the
northeastern
CONUS, and ridging forecast from the southwestern CONUS to parts of the
Plains.
Models are in agreement on a general de-amplification of the overall patter=
n
by
the end of the period. With this de-amplification, enhanced Pacific Flow is
forecast to become more dominant across much of the West Coast. Upstream,
troughing over Alaska is expected to weaken and push eastward by the end of
week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast to persist into
week-2 for most of Alaska. Ridging and a general low-amplitude pattern
thereafter, leads to increased chances of above-normal temperatures across
most
of the CONUS from the Mississippi Valley westward. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the eastern CONUS, as a trough predic=
ted
over the Eastern Seaboard early in the period pushes offshore.

As the overall pattern transitions to a more zonal orientation, enhanced
Pacific Flow is increasingly likely across much of the Northwest Coast.
Additionally, teleconnections from an upstream ridge predicted near the
western
Aleutians presents a very strong wet signal across much of the West Coast. =
Due
to these factors, above normal precipitation is favored across most of the
northwestern CONUS eastward to parts of the Northern Plains. Below normal
precipitation is favored to the Central and Southern Plains, due primarily =
to
the ridging forecast. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of th=
e
Northeast due to ahead of the departing trough. A wet pattern is likely for
much of Mainland Alaska in association with the troughing over the Gulf of
Alaska.

European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=

the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Mean troughing in the East will be reinforced several times by
shortwaves and maintained throughout much of the medium range
period (Sunday-Thursday). Elsewhere, an amplified ridge across the
west should weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into
the central U.S., which should also help to flatten the overall
upper pattern some by mid to later next week.

The guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for this
large scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in
the details. Energy reloading through the western side of the
trough in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show some timing
and magnitude differences, which would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The 18z yesterday (and todays
00z) GFS continues to be strongest/deepest with the upper low
while the 12z/yesterday ECMWF intially keeps a surface low farther
south along the Mid-Atlantic coast before jumping north and more
in line with the other solutions. The ensemble means seem to offer
a solution clustered closer to the GFS/CMC/UKMET which is what WPC
favored tonight. Regardless, the placement of this surface low
will have impacts for the Northeast including how much
precipitation falls, so this will need to be monitored.

Out West, a weak shortwave into the West Coast around Monday next
week should propagate eastward into the Central Plains and
eventually the East by the middle to latter part of next week. The
last couple of model runs indicate there's plenty of uncertainty
remaining with this system, especially the latter half of the
period mainly timing and intensity and how it interacts with the
Eastern trough already in place. A blend towards the ensemble
means later in the period seemed to mitigate these differences
well until these details can be ironed out in future runs.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest should be
weakening by Sunday, though some lingering moderate to locally
heavy rainfall will remain possible across the Olympic Peninsula
and far northern Cascades. Westerly flow across the Great Lakes
should continue to support lake effect snowfall with some light to
moderate accumulations possible Sunday into Monday. Models show
the heaviest rainfall associated with the early period Northeast
surface low should mainly remain offshore, but wrap around light
snow or coastal rain may be possible. An upper low camped out west
of Baja California may help funnel moisture towards the Gulf Coast
region, but associated precipitation should be light and scattered
in nature. After Monday, conditions across the CONUS should begin
to dry out for most regions as the flow becomes less amplified.
The exception to this may be across the Pacific Northwest where
troughing in the northeast Pacific should keep a consistent focus
of moisture into the region.

The mean trough over the East should keep temperatures slightly
below normal into Tuesday with some moderation back towards normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Meanwhile, upper level ridging keeps
conditions warm throughout the West and central U.S. the entire
period, with a handful of both record highs and warm overnight
lows possible. The greatest anomalies should be across the
northern-central Plains where daytime highs could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. As the flow flattens during the late period,
above normal temperatures should also begin expanding into the
Midwest and South.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Mean troughing in the East will be reinforced several times by
shortwaves and maintained throughout much of the medium range
period (Sunday-Thursday). Elsewhere, an amplified ridge across the
west should weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into
the central U.S., which should also help to flatten the overall
upper pattern some by mid to later next week.

The guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for this
large scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in
the details. Energy reloading through the western side of the
trough in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show some timing
and magnitude differences, which would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The 18z yesterday (and todays
00z) GFS continues to be strongest/deepest with the upper low
while the 12z/yesterday ECMWF intially keeps a surface low farther
south along the Mid-Atlantic coast before jumping north and more
in line with the other solutions. The ensemble means seem to offer
a solution clustered closer to the GFS/CMC/UKMET which is what WPC
favored tonight. Regardless, the placement of this surface low
will have impacts for the Northeast including how much
precipitation falls, so this will need to be monitored.

Out West, a weak shortwave into the West Coast around Monday next
week should propagate eastward into the Central Plains and
eventually the East by the middle to latter part of next week. The
last couple of model runs indicate there's plenty of uncertainty
remaining with this system, especially the latter half of the
period mainly timing and intensity and how it interacts with the
Eastern trough already in place. A blend towards the ensemble
means later in the period seemed to mitigate these differences
well until these details can be ironed out in future runs.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest should be
weakening by Sunday, though some lingering moderate to locally
heavy rainfall will remain possible across the Olympic Peninsula
and far northern Cascades. Westerly flow across the Great Lakes
should continue to support lake effect snowfall with some light to
moderate accumulations possible Sunday into Monday. Models show
the heaviest rainfall associated with the early period Northeast
surface low should mainly remain offshore, but wrap around light
snow or coastal rain may be possible. An upper low camped out west
of Baja California may help funnel moisture towards the Gulf Coast
region, but associated precipitation should be light and scattered
in nature. After Monday, conditions across the CONUS should begin
to dry out for most regions as the flow becomes less amplified.
The exception to this may be across the Pacific Northwest where
troughing in the northeast Pacific should keep a consistent focus
of moisture into the region.

The mean trough over the East should keep temperatures slightly
below normal into Tuesday with some moderation back towards normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Meanwhile, upper level ridging keeps
conditions warm throughout the West and central U.S. the entire
period, with a handful of both record highs and warm overnight
lows possible. The greatest anomalies should be across the
northern-central Plains where daytime highs could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. As the flow flattens during the late period,
above normal temperatures should also begin expanding into the

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CST Thu Nov 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
A closed mid-level low over portions of southern California/Arizona
and vicinity will retrograde southwestward into portions of the Baja
Peninsula. Meanwhile, an upper-level trough over the central CONUS
will shift east as a strong mid-level jet and zonal flow pattern
enters the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. At the surface,
high pressure over the Great Basin region will weaken throughout the
day.

...Portions of Southern California...
Critical fire-weather conditions will be ongoing this morning and
are expected to persist throughout the day. The regional pressure
gradient will favor strong offshore flow, with sustained winds of
20-30 mph, gusting to 40-50 mph in terrain-favored locations.
Despite the relaxing surface pressure gradient, winds should remain
strong into the afternoon as strong northeasterly mid-level flow
(60-70 kt) aloft overspreads the region. Likewise, RH values will
fall into the teens and single digits throughout the day. Given
these forecast indices, potential exists for localized extremely
critical fire-weather conditions where fuels have cured (e.g., ERC
values exceeding the 80th percentile), in addition to the
critical/elevated delineations.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Diurnally driven momentum transfer of modestly enhanced
northwesterly mid-level flow should yield a period of sustained
winds exceeding 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
Downsloping/compressing surface flow should aid in temperatures
warming into the low 50s F and RH values falling into the teens.
Fuels across the region remain receptive to large-fire spread,
supporting an elevated fire-weather threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CST Thu Nov 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed mid-level low over portions of the Baja Peninsula will lift
northeast and begin to merge with the broader jet stream, over
portions of the Southwest. Meanwhile, west-northwesterly mid-level
flow will remain positioned over the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Rockies. High pressure over the Great Basin region will
continue to weaken throughout the period.

...Portions of Southern California...
As the surface pressure gradient continues to weaken, offshore winds
will continue to subside throughout the day. Despite this trend,
sustained winds near 15 mph, along with higher gusts in
terrain-favored locations, should be possible. Dry conditions will
prevail, with RH values into the teens and single digits coinciding
with receptive fuels. Thus, elevated fire-weather conditions remain
likely for the region.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Dry/breezy conditions will be possible again during the afternoon in
response to diurnally driven mixing processes and persistent
marginally enhanced westerly flow aloft. Elevated fire-weather
conditions appear possible, but too localized to warrant any
highlights at this time.

...Developing storm system to produce widespread showers
throughout most of the eastern third of the U.S. this
Thanksgiving; thunderstorms and Excessive Rainfall possible in
southeast Texas; heavy snow likely in northern New England...

...Atmospheric River to generate moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the
Pacific Northwest today...

...Strong Santa Ana wind event to cause threatening fire weather
conditions and destructive wind gusts; cooler temperatures return
the East on Black Friday, warm-up continues out West...

The primary weather maker this Thanksgiving Day is an area of low
pressure tracking through the Upper Great Lakes. Its trailing cold
front is causing numerous showers to develop from the Great Lakes
and Mid-South to the western Gulf Coast. Southeast Texas may
observe enough instability within the atmosphere to trigger
thunderstorms, some of which could produce locally Excessive
Rainfall rates. By Thanksgiving night, showers are forecast to
reach the East Coast while colder temperatures funneling behind
the cold front initiate lake effect snow bands across parts of the
eastern Great Lakes and into the interior northern Mid-Atlantic.
This storm system is set to strengthen quickly during the day
Friday as an upper level low deepens over the Northeast. On the
northern side of the upper low, periods of snow are expected with
the heaviest totals taking shape over northern New England. Latest
forecast totals show over six inches in the Adirondack, Green and
White Mountains with as much as a foot of snow possible. Travelers
in northern New England may contend with icy and treacherous
conditions, especially on untreated surfaces late Friday into
Saturday morning.

In the West, a new Atmospheric River containing rich subtropical
Pacific moisture takes aim at the Pacific Northwest today. A
prolonged stretch of moderate-to-heavy rainfall combined with
rapid snow melt could lead to excess runoff. This may result
quickly rising creeks and streams, making localized flooding a
possibility in parts of western Washington. Locally heavy rainfall
is also possible in far northwestern Oregon, but the heaviest
rainfall totals (1 to 3 inches) are most likes to occur in the
Olympics and northern Cascades. High pressure building in atop the
Northwest on Friday will provide a brief break in the action, but
another round of heavy rain arrives late Saturday.

In contrast to their neighbors in the Northwest, residents in
Southern California are dealing with Santa Ana winds. High Wind
Warnings have been posted along the mountain ranges with Wind
Advisories near the coast. Wide spread wind gusts of 35 to 50 mph
are expected with damaging gusts of 70 mph are possible in the
mountains and foothills. In addition, dangerously low humidity
levels support a hazardous environment for fire weather
conditions. Red Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk for hazardous
fire weather conditions, issued by the Storm Prediction Center,
were issued for much of the Southern California mountains and
foothills. The Santa Ana wind event today should wind down to an
extent by Thanksgiving night but an Elevated Risk for favorable
fire weather conditions looks to persist into Black Friday.
Temperature-wise, a warm-up in the East today will be short lived
as a cold front ushers in yet another shot of cold Canadian air on
Friday. December-like temperatures look to stick around in the
Mid-Atlantic and New England on Saturday. Meanwhile, a building
upper level ridge over the western third of the Lower 48 means
temperatures will warm-up incrementally each day to close out the
week and into the upcoming weekend.

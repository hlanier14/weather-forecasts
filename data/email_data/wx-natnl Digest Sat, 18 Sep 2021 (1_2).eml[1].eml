Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1140 AM CDT Fri Sep 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

Elevated highlights were extended farther north along the Cascades
to reflect drier/breezier conditions than previously anticipated,
based on the latest high-resolution guidance. Otherwise, the
previous forecast remains on track, with widespread Elevated
conditions expected across much of the Interior West, with bouts of
locally Critical conditions likely across central Nevada, and
western into central Montana. Please see the previous forecast below
for more details.

..Squitieri.. 09/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CDT Fri Sep 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
Widespread elevated fire weather conditions are likely this
afternoon across portions of the Great Basin, northern Sierra, and
northern Rockies. This activity will largely be driven by
strengthening mid and upper-level flow across the West as an upper
trough shifts into the Pacific Northwest. A modest surge of moisture
into the southern Great Basin will introduce the potential for
scattered showers and thunderstorms for southern NV.

...northern Sierra...
The approach of the upper-level wave into the Pacific Northwest will
induce broad surface pressure falls across eastern WA/OR and
northwest NV. In response, west to southwesterly winds will increase
to around 15 mph. Terrain influences will likely result in stronger
winds in the immediate lee of the Sierra. Downslope warming and
drying will support RH reductions into the teens, and possibly upper
single digits. While elevated conditions are likely, modest fuel
readiness will yield an overall modest fire weather threat.

...Great Basin to southern Wyoming...
A weak upper-level wave noted in morning water-vapor imagery will
shift into the southern Great Basin through the day. Strengthening
southerly downslope flow will result in breezy conditions across
southern NV. Winds between 15-20 mph will likely coincide with RH
reductions into the 10-15% range during the early afternoon hours.
Elevated conditions appear probable, and a few locations in southern
NV may see transient critical conditions. Increasing
rain/thunderstorm chances during the late afternoon and evening
hours may limit the duration of the threat and aid in RH recoveries.
Further to the northeast, more localized elevated conditions are
expected across UT and southwest WY, but may linger well into the
late afternoon hours.

...northern Rockies...
Lee troughing in the lee of the Canadian Rockies juxtaposed next to
a surface high over the northern Plains will support strengthening
southerly winds across the northern Rockies. Sustained winds between
15-20 mph are likely with gusts up to 25-30 mph possible. An
unseasonably dry air mass over MT coupled with some downslope
influences will yield RH values in the single digits to low teens,
supporting elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions. The
highest potential for critical conditions will reside across
northeast ID into adjacent areas of MT where fuels are near the 97th
percentile, RH values below 10% are likely, and terrain influences
will support pockets of 20+ mph winds. However, confidence in the
coverage and duration of these conditions remains too low for a
critical area.

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs dynamical models indicate a transient lon=

pattern
across North America during the 6-10 day period. Multiple shortwave troughs
are
forecast to move through the eastern half of the CONUS, with the 0z ECMWF
ensembles being more amplified compared to the 6z GEFS and 0z Canadian
ensembles. The 0z and 6z solutions of the deterministic GFS and 0z
deterministic ECMWF have also indicated stronger troughing in the East

be favored in the manual 500-hPa height blend. A forecast trend toward a
negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation in late September favors
increased troughing in the East as well. Specifically, the manual blend
depicts
positive height anomalies across much of the western CONUS where ridging is
primarily favored, and near normal heights over most of the eastern and
central
CONUS. Above normal heights remain favored over Northern New England due to
increased southerly mid-level flow forecast ahead of the incoming troughs.
Below normal heights are forecast over most of Alaska underneath continued
troughing forecast across the state.

At the onset of the forecast period, a surface front is forecast to move
through the eastern U.S. with shortwave troughing moving through the region
thereafter. The models, particularly the 0z ECMWF ensemble, have trended mo=
re
amplified with this initial troughing, and subsequently probabilities for
below
normal temperatures are higher compared to yesterday. There are also
indications of a second trough diving southward into the region around day-=
10,
but there is larger spread in terms of amplitude, with the ECMWF ensemble
again
being the most amplified, along with the deterministic GFS and ECMWF
solutions.
Temperature anomalies of -5 to -10 deg F are indicated during the forecast
period, which would result in a taste of fall-like weather in the East. A
slight tilt toward increased probabilities of above normal temperatures
remains
favored over Northern New England on the front side of the mean trough axis
underneath increased southerly mid-level flow, in addition to most of the
Florida Peninsula, where the southward progression of the frontal boundary =
is
forecast to end. Increased ridging over the West favors increased
probabilities
for near to above normal temperatures. Troughing and below normal 500-hPa
height anomalies forecast over Alaska favors increased probabilities of bel=
ow
normal temperatures over much of the state. The temperature forecast is
generally supported by both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, with the
ECMWF
having the highest probabilities for below normal temperatures across the
east-central CONUS due to the stronger depiction of the troughing.

The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally agree on a dry pattern for mu=
ch
of the central and western CONUS, with the highest probabilities of below
normal precipitation indicated across the Rockies, behind the troughing to =
the
east, and underneath the ridging forecast over the West. The troughing
forecast
in the eastern CONUS favors increased probabilities for near to above norma=
l
precipitation over parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast due to enhanced
frontal activity, especially early in the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool=
 is
more robust with the above normal precipitation probabilities in the East
compared to the GEFS. A more amplified trough as indicated in the ECMWF
ensemble and the deterministic GFS/ECMWF solutions would also favor increas=
ed
baroclinicity and resultant surface low pressure development near or along =
the
Northeast coast, which would potentially enhance precipitation depending on
the
exact track. Troughing and associated surface low pressure over the Northea=
st
Pacific and Alaska increases the odds of above normal precipitation over pa=
rts
of southeastern Alaska and the Panhandle due to increased southerly flow.
Below
normal precipitation probabilities are increased over northern and western
Mainland Alaska due to being farther displaced from the forecast surface lo=
w
pressure, and underneath relatively weaker mid-level flow.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 25 - OCT 01, 2021

Dynamical models indicate a somewhat amplified pattern continuing across No=
rth
America during week-2, with troughing forecast over the East and ridging
upstream over the western and central CONUS. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs week-2 manual 500-hPa
height blend gives most weight to the 0z ECMWF ensemble given its consisten=
cy
with yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook. The blend indicates the=
 largest positive height
anomalies over the central and western CONUS, consistent with forecast
ridging,
and near normal heights over much of the eastern half of the CONUS. Near to
below normal heights remain forecast over southeastern Mainland Alaska and =
the
Panhandle due to continued influence from troughing. Positive height anomal=
ies
are forecast to become favored across the Aleutians and the western Mainlan=
d
as
the troughing weakens and shifts further east allowing ridging to build ove=
r
the Bering Sea.

The mid-level pattern across the CONUS favors increased probabilities for
above
normal temperatures over the western half, and increased probabilities for
near
to below normal temperatures across the most of the eastern half. The
exception
is over Maine, which is forecast to remain on the eastern side of the mean
troughing and underneath southerly mid-level flow, resulting in a tilt towa=
rd
increased above normal temperature probabilities. Increased probabilities f=
or
below normal temperatures remain favored across most of Alaska underneath t=
he
predicted troughing.

There is high confidence regarding increased chances for below normal
precipitation across most of the CONUS as a result of increased ridging and
surface high pressure, with the only uncertainty being across the Northeast
where coastal low pressure systems could enhance precipitation depending on
the
evolution of the troughing during the period. The eastward progression of t=
he
trough over the Gulf of Alaska and eventually closer to the west coast of
British Columbia favors increased chances for above normal precipitation
across
parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. Near to below norm=

precipitation probabilities are increased for the remainder of the state, o=

the backside of the trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN GREAT
BASIN INTO THE NORTHERN ROCKIES...

Critical highlights have been expanded across portions of northern
Nevada, as well as farther east in Montana down into northeast
Wyoming. Likewise, Elevated highlights have expanded southward into
southern Nevada and also into southern Wyoming/far northwest
Colorado. Latest guidance consensus has trended a bit drier and
windier across larger portions of the Northern Great Basin into the
Northern Rockies. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track.
Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 09/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0216 AM CDT Fri Sep 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level pattern is expected to undergo slight amplification
over the next 24-48 hours as an upper-level trough deepens over the
Pacific Northwest/West Coast. This will result in strengthening
southwesterly flow from the northern Sierra into the northern
Rockies, which will support increasing probabilities for elevated to
critical fire weather conditions. This pattern will also introduce
increasing rain chances for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Utah,
and southwest Wyoming, reducing the fire weather potential for these
regions.

...Northern Great Basin to Northern Rockies...
A belt of stronger mid to upper-level flow will become established
from northwest NV, through ID, and into southern MT and adjacent
areas of the northern High Plains. A deepening surface low over the
Canadian prairies will feature a trailing surface trough into the
northern Rockies, which will help induce breezy southwesterly flow
near the surface. The combination of a uni-directional wind profile,
diurnal boundary-layer mixing, and strong flow aloft will support
sustained winds between 15-25 mph with gusts upwards up 25-35 mph
(possibly up to 40-45 mph within the critical risk area). Although
receptive fuels are already in place for many locations,
hot/dry/windy conditions Friday will aid in further curing by
Saturday. A dry air mass already in place over the inter-mountain
West, coupled with downslope drying, will support RH values in the
low teens to low 20s. As such, widespread elevated conditions seem
likely with a belt of critical conditions probable under the axis of
stronger mid-level flow. Critical conditions are possible across
northeast WY within a downslope wind regime, but may be more
localized in nature.

...Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas is gradually dissipating but
will still bring pockets of locally heavy rain and flash flooding
to portions of the Gulf Coast states this weekend...

...A strong cold front and accompanying atmospheric river will
bring windy conditions and heavy rains to the Northwest tonight
through the weekend...

...Very warm, windy, and dry conditions will support widespread
elevated to critical fire weather conditions from the Great Basin
to the northern High Plains through Saturday...

Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas will continue to slowly drift north
and weaken over the lower Mississippi Valley over the day or so
and should dissipate on Saturday. However, there will still be
additional periods of showers and thunderstorms that will produce
locally heavy rainfall along the central Gulf Coast. Flash
flooding impacts, especially in urban areas, are possible across
this area. Even as the system dissipates, ample moisture will
remain in place through the weekend across much of the South, and
this will support scattered areas of showers and thunderstorms
area wide through the weekend.

Wet weather is also expected for the Northwest as a strong cold
front and an accompanying plume of deep moisture associated with
an atmospheric river gradually crosses the region tonight through
the weekend. Locally strong winds and heavy rain will overspread
the coastal ranges of Washington and Oregon, and the interior high
terrain of the Cascades. Rain should advance down into at least
northern California including the northern Sierra-Nevada by late
in the weekend and spread well inland into the northern Rockies as
well. Some of the higher peaks of the northern Rockies and the
northern Cascades by late in the weekend will also see sufficient
cold air arriving behind the cold front for some of the rain to
mix with or change to snow. Given that this is the first
atmospheric river of the season, the rainfall and colder
temperatures will generally be quite beneficial and welcomed given
the current widespread drought conditions and ongoing wildfire
activity. Locally as much as 2 to 4 inches of rain is expected
with the highest amounts over the coastal ranges of the Pacific
Northwest and into the Cascades. However, some of this heavier
rainfall may be enough to result in concerns for some localized
flash flooding and debris flow activity around some of the burn
scar locations.

Ahead of the system, windy, dry conditions and above-normal
temperatures are expected to support widespread elevated to
critical fire weather concerns across portions of the Great Basin,
northern Sierra-Nevada, northern Rockies, and the northern High
Plains through Saturday. As a result, Red Flag Warnings are in
effect for much of this region. Some temperatures are expected to
surge well into the 90s, more than 20 degrees above normal, across
portions of the northern High Plains on Saturday.

345 PM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 20 2021 - 12Z Fri Sep 24 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A strong trough pushing onto the plains Sunday night continues to
sweep across the rest of the CONUS, bringing below normal
temperatures and fallesque conditions for a day or two behind the
cold front. The next system enters the Pacific Northwest in the
middle of next week.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The deterministic guidance remains in above average agreement
through early next week, with the 06Z and to a lesser extent 12Z
GFS still showing a faster solution by Tuesday night with the
trough/cold front crossing the Great Lakes. This remains more
apparent with the second trough that approaches the Pacific
Northwest Wednesday which is still ahead of its own ensemble mean.
By Thursday, model spread becomes substantial across much of the
northern tier states with timing of the initial low/front over the
northeastern US and the progression of the next system which
stalls over the West Coast in the 12Z ECMWF, over the
Intermountain West in the 12Z CMC, with the 12Z GFS progressing it
east.

The WPC front/pressures forecast was primarily based on a nearly
equal blend of the 00Z/06Z deterministic guidance through
Tuesday/Day 4, begins a transition to ensemble means on
Wednesday/Day 5, then heavily relies on ensemble means, Thursday
and Friday. QPF with the main system from the Great Lakes and east
was timed fairly well in the 00Z CMC/UKMET which were between the
faster GFS and slower ECMWF.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the cold front from the Central Plains to the Great
Lakes Tuesday, shifting east to the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday before
pushing off the Northeast around Thursday. Plenty of Gulf-sourced
moisture will spread north in advance of the cold front and heavy
rainfall is possible. Some strong to severe storms will also be
possible where favorable parameters of wind shear and instability
exist, although location specifics remain uncertain. Snow in the
northern Rockies will taper off Monday as the low moves onto the
Plains.

Temperatures more like late October will spread east across the
Plains behind the cold front Monday, crossing the eastern Seaboard
by Thursday. Temperatures will generally be 5 to 10 degrees below
normal behind the cold front which will be a refreshing break for
many, particularly in the south who have not had a break in summer
heat yet. Depending on the progression of the next wave, the
Southwest would heat up as a ridge develops in its wake, or it is
cool if the low stalls near the Southwest.

and ahead of the cold front from the Central Plains to the Great
Lakes Tuesday, shifting east to the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday before
pushing off the Northeast around Thursday. Plenty of Gulf-sourced
moisture will spread north in advance of the cold front and heavy
rainfall is possible. Some strong to severe storms will also be
possible where favorable parameters of wind shear and instability
exist, although location specifics remain uncertain. Snow in the
northern Rockies will taper off Monday as the low moves onto the
Plains.

Temperatures more like late October will spread east across the
Plains behind the cold front Monday, crossing the eastern Seaboard
by Thursday. Temperatures will generally be 5 to 10 degrees below
normal behind the cold front which will be a refreshing break for
many, particularly in the south who have not had a break in summer
heat yet. Depending on the progression of the next wave, the
Southwest would heat up as a ridge develops in its wake, or it is
cool if the low stalls near the Southwest.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A strong trough pushing onto the plains Sunday night continues to
sweep across the rest of the CONUS, bringing below normal
temperatures and fallesque conditions for a day or two behind the
cold front. The next system enters the Pacific Northwest in the
middle of next week.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The deterministic guidance remains in above average agreement
through early next week, with the 06Z and to a lesser extent 12Z
GFS still showing a faster solution by Tuesday night with the
trough/cold front crossing the Great Lakes. This remains more
apparent with the second trough that approaches the Pacific
Northwest Wednesday which is still ahead of its own ensemble mean.
By Thursday, model spread becomes substantial across much of the
northern tier states with timing of the initial low/front over the
northeastern US and the progression of the next system which
stalls over the West Coast in the 12Z ECMWF, over the
Intermountain West in the 12Z CMC, with the 12Z GFS progressing it
east.

The WPC front/pressures forecast was primarily based on a nearly
equal blend of the 00Z/06Z deterministic guidance through
Tuesday/Day 4, begins a transition to ensemble means on
Wednesday/Day 5, then heavily relies on ensemble means, Thursday
and Friday. QPF with the main system from the Great Lakes and east
was timed fairly well in the 00Z CMC/UKMET which were between the
faster GFS and slower ECMWF.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the cold front from the Central Plains to the Great
Lakes Tuesday, shifting east to the Mid-Atlantic Wednesday before
pushing off the Northeast around Thursday. Plenty of Gulf-sourced
moisture will spread north in advance of the cold front and heavy

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 25 - FRIDAY OCTOBER 01: Detailed Summary

For Friday September 24 - Thursday September 30: Almost all models agree th=
at
a
significant positive 500-mb height anomaly will be centered somewhere from
northern Scandinavia to north-central Russia for the week as a whole, and m=
ost
have a less-amplified but still formidable ridge centered somewhere west of
Alaska. The implications for conditions in North America are uncertain, but
are
unlikely to be extreme. Regardless the details, all models keep a flat
upper-level mean pattern over the contiguous states, which seems driven by =
a
progressive, moderate flow where upper-level ridges and troughs don't settl=
e
into any fixed position. They are of low amplitude, and move systematically
across the lower 48 states. This brings mild weather to most of the contigu=
ous
states. No large north-south deviations in the upper levels of the atmosphe=
re
means no deep storms and no extremes of temperature. No amplified ridges wi=
ll
bring protracted or unseasonable heat to the CONUS, and no sharp troughs wi=
ll
bring in Arctic air from the north.



There are scenarios that could bring moderate precipitation to parts of the
Atlantic Seaboard and the western Gulf Coast region as some tropical moistu=
re
gets pulled into these areas from the Atlantic, but only the 00Z Canadian
ensemble depicts above normal precipitation, while most other models keep
subnormal precipitation in those areas, along with much of the rest of the
country. The bottom line is, there is nothing pointing toward any kind of
extreme weather in the contiguous states during this 7-day period, and no
potential week-2 hazards are identified.



A more amplified pattern will likely affect Alaska, with a moderate amplifi=
ed
ridge west of the state allowing cold air to settle into northern sections
while a series of storms progress along the southern coastline. This is not=
 an
unusual pattern this time of year, but it does pose the threat of bringing
unseasonably cold air into northern parts of the state justifying a continu=
ed
slight risk for much below normal temperatures on Sep 24-25. Periods of hea=
vy
precipitation and storminess are forecast to impact the southern tier,
especially on the eastern side. Heavy precipitation could affect areas as f=
ar
west as Anchorage for at least a short time, but the Panhandle and adjacent
areas are most likely to be impacted by heavy precipitation where a slight
risk
for heavy precipitation is highlighted for Sep 24-26. Precipitation looks t=
o
be
heavier and longer-lasting there than further west, with those areas minima=
lly
affected by a second storm that pushes east from the North Pacific Ocean.

unseasonably cold air into northern parts of the state justifying a continu=
ed
slight risk for much below normal temperatures on Sep 24-25. Periods of hea=
vy
precipitation and storminess are forecast to impact the southern tier,
especially on the eastern side. Heavy precipitation could affect areas as f=
ar
west as Anchorage for at least a short time, but the Panhandle and adjacent
areas are most likely to be impacted by heavy precipitation where a slight
risk
for heavy precipitation is highlighted for Sep 24-26. Precipitation looks t=
o
be
heavier and longer-lasting there than further west, with those areas minima=
lly
affected by a second storm that pushes east from the North Pacific Ocean.

0107 AM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR GREAT BASIN AND NORTHERN
ROCKIES...

...Synopsis...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely today as
winds increase in response to an approaching upper-level trough in
the Pacific Northwest. Hot, dry, and windy conditions across much of
the West yesterday aided in curing fuels, which will help support
widespread fire weather concerns today. While this system will bring
beneficial rainfall to parts of the Pacific Northwest, thunderstorm
chances across Utah, western Colorado, and southwest Wyoming may
pose a low-end lightning-driven fire weather concern.

...Western Great Basin into Southwest Montana...
VWP observations over the past few hours from ID and MT show
strengthening mid-level flow as the upper-level wave continues to
move onshore across the Pacific Northwest. This trend is expected to
continue through the day as an axis of stronger flow becomes
established from northwest NV into ID and western MT ahead of a cold
front. Diurnal boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-directional
wind profile will allow for efficient downward transfer of stronger
winds aloft. Ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities
for 20-25 mph winds through this corridor with gusts up to 30-40 mph
(and possibly up to 40-50 mph for wind-prone locations). Receptive
fuels are already in place for most locations and RH reductions into
the low teens are expected. Critical conditions remain most likely
through this northwestern NV-southwest MT corridor, but may extend
as far south as the lee of the central/southern Sierra. There is
some uncertainty regarding the westward extent of both critical and
elevated conditions due to cloud cover/rainfall associated with the
approaching cold front.

...Southern Montana to northeast Wyoming...
Southwesterly winds will likely increase to 15-25 mph this afternoon
as a surface low deepens over the Canadian Prairies. Downslope
affects will aid in RH reductions into the low teens to low 20s, and
boundary-layer mixing will support wind gusts upwards of 25-35 mph.
Critical conditions are expected across south-central MT into
northeast WY where downslope warming/drying will be strongest in the
lee of the terrain, but may occur as far north as northeast MT.

...Utah, Western Colorado, and southwest Wyoming...
Thunderstorms are likely today across much of UT and into adjacent
areas of western CO and southwest WY as a surge of monsoonal
moisture shifts northward in tandem with a weak upper-level impulse.
Recent fuel analyses indicate some locations have receptive fuels
with ERC values above the 75th percentile and fine fuel moisture
values below 5%. As such, lightning may pose a low-end fire weather
concern. However, no highlights will be introduced given the overall
modest fuel status of the region and high wetting rain potential.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
226 AM EDT Sat Sep 18 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 21 2021 - 12Z Sat Sep 25 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The strong storm system that is currently affecting the Pacific
Northwest is expected to be over the general vicinity of the
northern Great Lakes by Tuesday morning, accompanied by a strong
cold front that should steadily progress across the eastern third
of the nation.  The large surface high and upper ridge that will
be across the eastern U.S. early in the week will eventually give
way to the approaching trough and cold front, which will herald a
pattern change compared to the recent extension of summer-like
heat and humidity.  In addition, a second storm system is forecast
to reach the northwestern U.S. by Wednesday night and into
Thursday as the storm track across the northeast Pacific remains
active next week, along with a possible closed low over the Desert
Southwest by the end of next week.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The latest deterministic guidance is initially in decent agreement
on Tuesday across most of the continental U.S. before rather
significant differences emerge as early as Wednesday night and
below average confidence exists for the second half of the
forecast period.  The long wave trough crossing the Midwest may
evolve into a slower moving closed low over the Ohio Valley based
on the non-NCEP guidance, and thus a slower cold front progression
compared to earlier forecasts, with the UKMET the slowest solution
here.  The GFS and its ensemble mean bring the cold front and
shortwave through faster before evolving into a closed low over
the Northeast states by Thursday night.  This has implications for
the next shortwave/front crossing the Rockies and northern Plains
by the end of the week, with the GFS progressive and more
amplified.  Substantial uncertainties also exist with a potential
weak closed low near California as suggested by the 12Z ECMWF,
whereas the bulk of the guidance is more suggestive of a broad
upper ridge in this region.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily based on a nearly
equal blend of the CMC/GFS/ECMWF through Wednesday, and then
slightly more weighting on the ECWMF while still maintaining some
of the GFS and CMC through Thursday.  More of the ensemble means
were incorporated for Friday and Saturday, and some previous WPC
continuity was maintained through day 6 owing to the model
variations noted above.  Noteworthy changes in the forecast are
possible in future updates for Thursday and beyond.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms are expected to
develop along and ahead of the cold front from the Tennessee River
Valley to the Great Lakes midweek, with some locations getting on
the order of 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with locally higher totals
possible.  This unsettled weather is expected to reach the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Thursday with locally heavy rainfall
possible.  Some strong to severe storms will also be possible
where favorable parameters of wind shear and instability exist,
although location specifics are uncertain.  There may also be
enhanced fire weather concerns for portions of the West, depending
on the magnitude of the pressure gradient and resulting winds in
the wake of the cold front.

In terms of temperatures, it will be pleasantly cool behind the
cold front across the Plains and Midwest for the middle of the
week, and the fall-like conditions should make it to the East
Coast by Friday along with improving humidity levels.  A warming
trend is likely to commence across much of the western U.S. by
next weekend in response to a building upper level ridge, although
no major heat waves are currently anticipated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Sat Sep 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will become limited spatially Sunday as
showers and thunderstorms overspread the inter-mountain West behind
a cold front. A trailing surface trough along the High Plains will
induce downslope flow across eastern WY and CO, which may result in
elevated fire weather conditions. Likewise, increasing winds ahead
of a cold front may support areas of elevated conditions across
southeastern Nevada. Fire weather concerns may also evolve across
parts of the southern Sierra, but will likely remain too localized
for highlights.

...Eastern Wyoming and High Plains...
Downslope west to southwesterly winds will likely increase to 15-20
mph across eastern WY Sunday afternoon, and a few locations may see
sustained winds near 25 mph prior to a cold frontal passage late in
the afternoon. RH reductions into the teens are possible, but may be
hindered by increasing clouds through the day. Elevated conditions
appear most likely across east-central WY, but may evolve as far
south as eastern CO.

...Southeast Nevada...
A cold front is forecast to gradually translate southeastward across
the Great Basin through the day Sunday. Ahead of this boundary, warm
temperatures and mostly clear skies will support deep boundary-layer
mixing that will likely result in RH reductions into the teens with
breezy 15-20 mph winds. Elevated conditions are possible, but the
spatial extent of the threat remains somewhat uncertain, especially
given the potential for wetting rainfall across far eastern NV and
western UT over the next 24 hours.

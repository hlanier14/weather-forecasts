Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Thu Jul 01 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 03 2021

...Excessive heat continues across interior sections of the
Northwest and Northern Rockies, extending eastward into the
Northern Plains...

...Cold front to bring severe weather, heavy rain, and flooding
chances to the Mid-Atlantic today...

...Flash Flooding threat found across portions of Oklahoma and the
Texas Panhandle through Friday morning...

The weather pattern to start the month of July will feature
continued above average temperatures across the Northwest and
Northern Plains, with below average temperatures and rain chances
from the Northeast to the Southern Rockies. The extreme and
historic heat found throughout the Northwest earlier this week is
very slowly coming to an end. However, temperatures 10 to 20
degrees above average are expected to remain over the Northern
Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern High Plains through
Saturday. Highs into the upper-90s and low triple digits will
still have the potential to break a few daily high temperature
records. As an upper-level ridge migrates to south-central Canada
on Friday, above average temperatures and oppressive heat will
stretch into the Northern Plains. Locations between eastern
Montana and Minnesota will experience a hot end of the workweek,
with high into the upper-90s and some spots potentially breaking
into the triple digits. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat
Advisories are in effect across interior Washington and Oregon,
far northern California, as well as much of Idaho and Montana.
Much of this region is experiencing severe drought conditions,
which could provide potential wildfires a ripe environment to grow
rapidly. Thus, Red Flag Warnings have been issued throughout the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Plains to highlight the concern.

For the Eastern U.S., a slow-moving cold front is forecast to
swing into the Mid-Atlantic and Tennessee Valley today. As it does
so, a potent upper-level low is expected to drop south from Canada
and into the Lower Great Lakes, providing a sufficient environment
for thunderstorms to develop over the Mid-Atlantic. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
weather throughout parts of the Mid-Atlantic, specifically between
southern New Jersey and central Virginia, including most of the
Delmarva Peninsula. Damaging wind gusts are the main concern.
Meanwhile, precipitable water amounts across the Mid-Atlantic this
morning are well above average, which could lead to thunderstorms
capable of producing heavy rain. Rainfall amounts of 1 to 3
inches, with locally high amounts can be expected between the
Mid-Atlantic and Tennessee Valley. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall (level 2/4) has been issued for this region, as well as
Flash Flood Watches that extend from New Jersey to eastern
Tennessee. By Friday, the aforementioned cold front is forecast to
push the heavy rain threat south and into eastern North Carolina.

Numerous rounds of slow-moving thunderstorms are also possible on
the western edge of the cold front across the Southern Plains this
evening and into early Friday. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall
has been issued for western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle,
where 2 to 4 inches of rain are forecast. Elsewhere, continued
shower and thunderstorm chances will be found across the Southern
Rockies and Southeast through Saturday. Scattered showers are also
expected to linger throughout the Northeast early this weekend
underneath the aforementioned upper-level low and could put a
damper on early Independence Day celebrations.

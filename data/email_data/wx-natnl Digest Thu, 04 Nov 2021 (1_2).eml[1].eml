Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
211 PM EDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the central U.S. over the
weekend toward the East by Tuesday-Wednesday, separating weekend
troughing in the East with mean troughing in the eastern
Pacific/West. A series of fronts and shortwaves coming into the
West Coast will keep precipitation chances high there, while a
front and developing low pressure system off the East Coast will
spread some rain across Florida and up the Southeast coast this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance begins the medium rnage period with
reasonably good agreement this weekend, which indicates a
shortwave over the Midwest/Great Lakes attempting to combine with
southern stream energy over the Southeast. Differences in the
details and placement continue off the Southeast coast regarding a
developing and deepening surface low. The 00z ECMWF is the
farthest west with the surface low, which obviously affects
potential rainfall impacts farther inland across the Carolinas
Saturday-Sunday. The rest of the guidance favors a track a little
more offshore, which fits in line with WPC continuity as well.

Across the West, a couple of shortwaves should move ashore this
weekend and again early next week. The guidance shows better
agreement with the first one as it shifts across the Northwest and
into southern Canada, pushing a cold front across the
north-central U.S. and the Midwest. Behind this, troughing
amplifies over the West Coast at the beginning of next week as an
upper low drops southward from the Gulf of Alaska. Uncertainties
begin to arise by Tuesday/day 6 both with placement and strength.
Much of the deterministic guidance and ensembles continues to show
plenty of run to run variability suggesting the evolution and
timing of this system is low confidence at best right now,
especially as it moves into the West/Rockies on Wednesday. A blend
towards the ensemble means seems to give the best starting point,
amidst plenty of lingering uncertainty.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a surface low pressure and frontal system develops near/over
Florida Saturday and tracks northeastward into the western
Atlantic, it will spread rain across Florida and into the coastal
Carolinas and possibly the Mid-Atlantic region on the backside of
the low over the weekend. Current forecasts do not show rainfall
reaching very far inland, given a well offshore track of the low,
but small shifts of the low track could lead to significantly more
or less rainfall in coastal areas, especially for the Outer Banks
of North Carolina. The deepening system should also bring a period
of gusty winds to locations along the East Coast.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation this weekend into early next week near the
West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific Northwest and northern
California can expect the heaviest precipitation, with typical
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Precipitation is
likely to spread into the Intermountain West and Rockies as well,
with rain and mountain snow threats increasing next Monday into
Wednesday.

Behind the low pressure system in the western Atlantic, a cold
surface high to the west will bring northerly winds and high
temperatures that are 10-20F below normal to the Southeast through
the weekend. Lows could be 5-10F below normal farther north in
this pattern as well, with temperatures in the mid to low 30s for
much of the Ohio Valley Saturday morning, which could result in
the first frost or freeze of the season for some places.
Meanwhile, a persistent upper-level ridge over the west-central
U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above average by 10-20
degrees over the Plains into the Midwest through early next week,
with highs 5-10F above normal stretching toward the East Coast by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs
modestly below normal over the West Coast on most days, eventually

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
211 PM EDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the central U.S. over the
weekend toward the East by Tuesday-Wednesday, separating weekend
troughing in the East with mean troughing in the eastern
Pacific/West. A series of fronts and shortwaves coming into the
West Coast will keep precipitation chances high there, while a
front and developing low pressure system off the East Coast will
spread some rain across Florida and up the Southeast coast this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance begins the medium rnage period with
reasonably good agreement this weekend, which indicates a
shortwave over the Midwest/Great Lakes attempting to combine with
southern stream energy over the Southeast. Differences in the
details and placement continue off the Southeast coast regarding a
developing and deepening surface low. The 00z ECMWF is the
farthest west with the surface low, which obviously affects
potential rainfall impacts farther inland across the Carolinas
Saturday-Sunday. The rest of the guidance favors a track a little
more offshore, which fits in line with WPC continuity as well.

Across the West, a couple of shortwaves should move ashore this
weekend and again early next week. The guidance shows better
agreement with the first one as it shifts across the Northwest and
into southern Canada, pushing a cold front across the
north-central U.S. and the Midwest. Behind this, troughing
amplifies over the West Coast at the beginning of next week as an
upper low drops southward from the Gulf of Alaska. Uncertainties
begin to arise by Tuesday/day 6 both with placement and strength.
Much of the deterministic guidance and ensembles continues to show
plenty of run to run variability suggesting the evolution and
timing of this system is low confidence at best right now,
especially as it moves into the West/Rockies on Wednesday. A blend
towards the ensemble means seems to give the best starting point,
amidst plenty of lingering uncertainty.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a surface low pressure and frontal system develops near/over
Florida Saturday and tracks northeastward into the western
Atlantic, it will spread rain across Florida and into the coastal
Carolinas and possibly the Mid-Atlantic region on the backside of
the low over the weekend. Current forecasts do not show rainfall
reaching very far inland, given a well offshore track of the low,
but small shifts of the low track could lead to significantly more
or less rainfall in coastal areas, especially for the Outer Banks
of North Carolina. The deepening system should also bring a period
of gusty winds to locations along the East Coast.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation this weekend into early next week near the
West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific Northwest and northern
California can expect the heaviest precipitation, with typical
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Precipitation is
likely to spread into the Intermountain West and Rockies as well,
with rain and mountain snow threats increasing next Monday into
Wednesday.

Behind the low pressure system in the western Atlantic, a cold
surface high to the west will bring northerly winds and high
temperatures that are 10-20F below normal to the Southeast through
the weekend. Lows could be 5-10F below normal farther north in
this pattern as well, with temperatures in the mid to low 30s for
much of the Ohio Valley Saturday morning, which could result in
the first frost or freeze of the season for some places.
Meanwhile, a persistent upper-level ridge over the west-central
U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above average by 10-20
degrees over the Plains into the Midwest through early next week,
with highs 5-10F above normal stretching toward the East Coast by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs
modestly below normal over the West Coast on most days, eventually
entering into the Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

...Slow moving cold front to bring heavy rain to portions of the
Southern Texas today...

...Unseasonably cool temperatures to persist across the Central
and Eastern US...

...Strong Western low pressure will bring high winds, rain and
higher elevation snow to the PacNW; while bringing above normal
temperatures to the Intermountain West and Northern Plains by
Friday...

A broad surface high pressure system continues to drop further
south across the Midwest dominating nearly all of the lower 48
east of the Rockies.  Mid-level troughing and cooler Canadian air
continues to progress eastward across the Great Lakes supporting
Lake Effect rain and snows downwind through early Thursday though
the strongest plumes and enhanced risk of snowfall are shutting
down today with only light lingering effects into Thursday morning
with Winter Weather Advisories having been canceled earlier this
morning.  As the cold air filters south across the Southern
Plains, the associated cold front and enhanced moisture both off
the Western Gulf of Mexico and mid-level moisture off the
subtropical Pacific will support slow moving and efficient showers
with some thunderstorms across Deep South Texas this afternoon
into overnight hours.  The potential for 1.5-2"/hr rain rates may
result in highly isolated 3+" totals pose a localized risk of
flash flooding resulting in the Weather Prediction Center
maintaining a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall.

As the frontal zone slips south into Mexico/Gulf of Mexico,
interests turn back to the unseasonably cool air associated with
this broad/dominant high pressure belt across the Plains to east
coast. High temperatures of 15-25 degrees below average will slide
from the Ohio Valley/Central Plains to the Southern Plains into
the Deep South and Mid-Atlantic today/tonight and to the Gulf
Coast and Carolinas Thursday into Friday.  Temperatures will be
moderating across the High Plains to the Northern Plains/Upper
Great Lakes by Friday as well as warmer air returns from the
approach of stronger systems originating out of the Pacific over
the later portion of the week.

The first of in a series of low pressure systems are already
influencing the Pacific Northwest coastal regions with
strengthening winds and increasing rainfall potential. A High Wind
Warning is currently in affect for tonight for the Oregon coast
where strong gusty winds of 60 to 75 mph are possible tonight into
Thursday morning with some of the southeastern Oregon Mountain
peaks to see similar gusts though surrounding areas the Willamette
valley of 20-35 mph and Northwest California to 40-50 mph
supporting Wind Advisories.  Accompanying the strong winds will be
increased rainfall rainfall particularly for south-southwest
facing temporal rain forests of the same area with hourly rain
totals of .5-.75" possible.  The front will be fast moving,
reducing duration but the potential of 1-2.5" through morning are
possible from N California to the Olympic Peninsula.  As the front
shifts eastward into the interior of WA/OR/N CA, rains will
lighten but bring high elevation snow to the Cascades northern
Sierra Nevada of Northeast California) and northern Rockies.
Persistent light to moderate showers and higher elevation snows
will persist before the approach of the next cold front on Friday
morning.  While not a strong as the initial front, precipitation
totals of 2-4" are possible by mid-day Friday mainly across
coastal and Cascades. Temperatures will be generally 5-10 degrees
above normal across much of the West ahead of these storms, with
only normal to slightly below normal temperatures for highs
on/along the coast where rainfall will be highest.  Though, as the
initial storm crosses the higher terrain, southerly winds and
down-slope heating will result in higher anomalies of 15-20
degrees across the Northern High Plains Thursday bleeding over to
Northern Plains by Friday

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed November 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 09 - 13 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a ridge with above-normal mid-le=
vel
heights over the Bering Sea and western Alaska, while a trough is forecast
over
the Gulf of Alaska extending southward over the North Pacific. A ridge is
building over the Southwest of the CONUS, while a trough amplifies over the
southern central CONUS with slightly below normal mid-level heights, in
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
model solutions. A ridge is predicted over the northeastern CONUS, with
associated above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across most of Alaska, except for par=
ts
of the North Slope, under anomalous easterly and northerly flow. Below-norm=
al
temperature probabilities are elevated across much of the Pacific Northwest=
,
associated with increased cloudiness, as well as below-normal 500-hPa heigh=
ts
early in the period. Above-normal temperatures are favored for parts of the
Southwest, under positive 500-hPa Height anomalies. Above-normal temperatur=
es
are favored for the central and southeastern CONUS, under above-normal
mid-level heights early in the period, although probabilities are moderate,=
 as
a trough digs into the central CONUS later in the period. Greater
probabilities
of above-normal temperatures extend across the Northeast under predicted
above-normal mid-level heights.

Below-normal precipitation is favored over most of Alaska, except the North
Slope and the southern Alaska Panhandle, under anomalous easterly and
northerly
flow. Ahead of predicted troughing primarily early in the period, above-nor=
mal
precipitation is likely for much of the western CONUS extending into the
Northern and Central Plains. Probabilities for above-normal precipitation
increase across much of the eastern CONUS, as a predicted trough develops o=
ver
the central CONUS. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced ov=
er
much of the Southwest and Southern Plains, with near-normal precipitation
predicted in climatologically arid regions of the Southwest, under predicte=
d
ridging with above-normal mid-level heights.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the average large-scale circulation
pattern,
offset by differences among the temperature and precipitation tools as well=
 as
a changing circulation pattern during the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 11 - 17 2021

During the week-2 period, the predicted 500-hPa circulation continues to
change. A trough over the Northern Pacific is forecast to shift westward an=
d a
mean ridge is predicted over the western CONUS with above-normal mid-level
heights. A trough and associated below-normal heights are forecast over mos=
t
of
the eastern CONUS. Downstream of this trough, a weakening ridge is forecast=
 to
progress eastward over the Northeast,  leading to slightly above-normal
average
mid-level heights.

Troughing over Alaska and anomalous easterly and northerly flow lead to lik=
ely
below-normal temperatures across much of Alaska. Above-normal mid-level
heights
lead to increased probabilities of above-normal temperatures across the Wes=
t.
Above-normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over the northeastern CONUS,
favoring
above-normal temperatures across the region. Near-normal temperatures are
favored over most of the central CONUS and Southeast, with below-normal
temperatures favored over the Florida Peninsula, as troughing develops over
the
region.

Enhanced easterly and northeasterly flow favors below-normal precipitation
across most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. The trough over the North=
ern
Pacific favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation for
extreme
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, as well as parts of =
the
Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies, due to increased onshore flow.=
 A
predicted trough over the central CONUS leads to enhanced probabilities of
above-normal precipitation for the Great Lakes region and east of the
Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast, due to storm system development o=
ver
these regions, and consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool.
Below-normal precipitation is favored over the Southwest and the Central an=
d
Southern Plains, under and ahead of a mid-level ridge.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools, with a changing circulation pattern during th=
e
period.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to move across northern
California during the day on Thursday. At the surface, a cold front
will move southeast across Nevada. Some dry and gusty winds are
possible ahead of this cold front Thursday afternoon across central
Nevada. However, fuels in this area are quite moist and therefore,
fire weather concerns should remain minimal. Elsewhere, cool and/or
moist conditions and fuels should preclude any fire weather threat.

300 PM EDT November 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: Most week-2 hazards will be associated with a potent surface stor=
m
expected to move northward through the middle of the CONUS and into Canada.
This will bring a chance for heavy precipitation to a broad area from the
interior Southeast and lower Mississippi Valley northward through the upper
Midwest. A strong surface pressure gradient between this storm and the surf=
ace
high pressure off the Atlantic Coast increases chances for unusually strong
winds along and east of the storm track, from the southeastern Great Plains
into the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. Strong winds could also
occur farther north and west as the surface low intensifies. This storm is
expected to drag cold Canadian into the northern Plains left of the storm
track
creating a chance for heavy snow there In the storm=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs wake. Also, northerly
winds could pull unusually cold air into parts of the southern High Plains.
Other hazards could be associated with a surface high pressure centered ove=
r
the Great Basin during the first half of week-2, which introduces the
potential
for strong downsloping Santa Ana winds in southern California west of the
mountains. In Alaska, very cold air could settle into the interior
northeastern
part of the state during the middle of week-2, with temperatures potentiall=
y
reaching as low as -40 deg F.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures in the Southern High Plains,
Fri-Sat, Nov 12-13.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures in parts of northeastern Alas=
ka,
Fri-Tue, Nov 12-16.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation in the interior Southeast, the Mississip=
pi
Valley, the northeastern Great Plains, and western Great Lakes Region, Thu-

Nov 11-13.

Slight risk of heavy snowfall in parts of the northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley Thu-Sat Nov 11-13

Slight risk of high winds in parts of the south-central Great Plains, the

FOR THURSDAY NOVEMBER 11 - WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 17: Across North America, the
model consensus features two noticeable changes from yesterday. A stronger
ridge in the western CONUS that pushes the mid-level trough farther west, a=
nd
a
slightly slower storm system in the central CONUS that takes a little longe=
r
to
intensify as it moves northward. But models have come into better agreement=
 on
timing and intensity, with most depicting the central CONUS storm rapidly
intensifying as it moves toward the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lake=
s
Region. The stronger storm pulls a significant amount of moisture westward
along the cold conveyor belt into cold air being pulled into the northern
Plains, leading to a slight risk of heavy snowfall as the storm exits the
Nation. In addition, the pressure gradient between the storm system and a h=
igh
pressure area centered off the Atlantic Coast could bring strong winds into
the
western Tennessee and Lower Ohio Valleys, and as the storm intensifies fart=
her
north, strong winds should develop farther north into the Upper Midwest and
northern Great Plains. The Canadian operational model and, to a lesser exte=
nt,
the Canadian ensemble mean and the operational Canadian Model are outliers,
taking a piece of vorticity farther to the southern High Plains and phasing=
 it
with the broader trough farther east, delaying storm development and allowi=
ng
the system to strengthen farther south than model consensus. This scenario
remains possible, but isn=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt considered at this ti=
me given a broad model
consensus on the expected scenario.



Looking at the broader picture, there is good agreement on the week-2 mean
pattern, including the Canadian models that handle the storm in the central
CONUS a bit differently than the other models. The mid-level anomalous ridg=
e
that has wandered around northern Canada and Greenland is expected to conti=
nue
by almost all models, though it appears slightly weaker than yesterday. Oth=
er
features, all of which reflect a broad model consensus, include a mean
mid-level trough in much of the East outside New England, a ridge across th=
e
interior West, and a strong mid-level trough across Alaska and the
north-central Pacific Ocean. This relaxes the strong onshore flow in the
Northwest compared to yesterday and follows recent model trends, so
possibilities for heavy precipitation and strong winds declined and have be=
en
removed. The stronger mid-level ridge and anomalous surface high pressure
centered over the interior West imply a potential for strong downsloping Sa=
nta
Ana winds in southern California to the west of the coastal mountain ranges=
.
The threat decreases later in week-2, when the high pressure system starts =
to
weaken and the pressure gradient in southern California begins to relax. Th=
e
mid-level trough that extends from north of Alaska into the northern Pacifi=
c
Ocean could allow cold air to be drawn in from northern Canada and settle i=

parts of interior northeastern east-central Alaska, particularly in areas o=

lower elevation. Models aren=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt unified in how low=
 temperatures might get,
but
there is a non-trivial chance that temperatures could drop as low as -40 de=
g.
F
during the middle of week-2.



Later in week-2, a more progressive weather pattern, with less-amplified

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
425 PM EDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the central U.S. over the
weekend toward the East by Tuesday-Wednesday, separating weekend
troughing in the East with mean troughing in the eastern
Pacific/West. A series of fronts and shortwaves coming into the
West Coast will keep precipitation chances high there, while a
front and developing low pressure system off the East Coast will
spread some rain across Florida and up the Southeast coast this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest model guidance begins the medium rnage period with
reasonably good agreement this weekend, which indicates a
shortwave over the Midwest/Great Lakes attempting to combine with
southern stream energy over the Southeast. Differences in the
details and placement continue off the Southeast coast regarding a
developing and deepening surface low. The 00z ECMWF is the
farthest west with the surface low, which obviously affects
potential rainfall impacts farther inland across the Carolinas
Saturday-Sunday. The rest of the guidance favors a track a little
more offshore, which fits in line with WPC continuity as well.

Across the West, a couple of shortwaves should move ashore this
weekend and again early next week. The guidance shows better
agreement with the first one as it shifts across the Northwest and
into southern Canada, pushing a cold front across the
north-central U.S. and the Midwest. Behind this, troughing
amplifies over the West Coast at the beginning of next week as an
upper low drops southward from the Gulf of Alaska. Uncertainties
begin to arise by Tuesday/day 6 both with placement and strength.
Much of the deterministic guidance and ensembles continues to show
plenty of run to run variability suggesting the evolution and
timing of this system is low confidence at best right now,
especially as it moves into the West/Rockies on Wednesday. A blend
towards the ensemble means seems to give the best starting point,
amidst plenty of lingering uncertainty.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a surface low pressure and frontal system develops near/over
Florida Saturday and tracks northeastward into the western
Atlantic, it will spread rain across Florida and into the coastal
Carolinas and possibly the Mid-Atlantic region on the backside of
the low over the weekend. Current forecasts do not show rainfall
reaching very far inland, given a well offshore track of the low,
but small shifts of the low track could lead to significantly more
or less rainfall in coastal areas, especially for the Outer Banks
of North Carolina. The deepening system should also bring a period
of gusty winds to locations along the East Coast.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation this weekend into early next week near the
West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific Northwest and northern
California can expect the heaviest precipitation, with typical
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Precipitation is
likely to spread into the Intermountain West and Rockies as well,
with rain and mountain snow threats increasing next Monday into
Wednesday.

Behind the low pressure system in the western Atlantic, a cold
surface high to the west will bring northerly winds and high
temperatures that are 10-20F below normal to the Southeast through
the weekend. Lows could be 5-10F below normal farther north in
this pattern as well, with temperatures in the mid to low 30s for
much of the Ohio Valley Saturday morning, which could result in
the first frost or freeze of the season for some places.
Meanwhile, a persistent upper-level ridge over the west-central
U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above average by 10-20
degrees over the Plains into the Midwest through early next week,
with highs 5-10F above normal stretching toward the East Coast by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs
modestly below normal over the West Coast on most days, eventually
entering into the Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Thu Nov 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough, moving inland on the Oregon coast this morning,
will shift south and east through the day. As it does, a cold front
will move southeastward across portions of the Great Basin. Some dry
and breezy conditions are possible in portions of central Nevada.
However, fuels in this area are quite moist and therefore, fire
weather concerns should remain low.

Elsewhere in the CONUS, fire weather concerns remain minimal due to
a cool/moist low-level airmass and moist fuels.

...Synopsis...
Strong westerly winds are expected to develop across eastern Montana

expected to remain above 30 percent and fuels in this area are quite
moist. Therefore, no elevated delineation is warranted in this
region.

Isolated dry and breezy conditions may occur in portions of
downslope flow in eastern Wyoming. However, fuels in this area
should not be receptive to fire spread and therefore, fire weather
concerns remain low.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
316 AM EDT Thu Nov 04 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Nov 07 2021 - 12Z Thu Nov 11 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with an upper ridge
across the central U.S., separating troughing in the East and
along the West Coast. This pattern shifts eastward as the week
progresses, as multiple shortwaves from the Pacific deepen
troughing across the central U.S. by midweek. A series of fronts
coming into the West Coast will keep precipitation chances high
there, and precipitation is currently expected to increase over
the central U.S. by Wednesday as a low pressure system
consolidates in the Midwest.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z model guidance continues to show reasonably good
agreement at the beginning of the medium range period with the
large-scale pattern, though some differences still remain with the
position and track of the surface low moving northeastward through
the western Atlantic Sunday into Monday with the eastern upper
trough. The 18Z GFS appeared to be on the faster/more northeast
side of the guidance envelope and was not particularly favored,
while the 12Z ECMWF was on the slower side by Monday. Favored a
position in between, which was closer to the ensemble means'
position and other 12Z guidance including the GFS, and which fits
in line with WPC continuity.

Shortwave differences remain within the jet stream across the West
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada. Initially
these differences are nothing too egregious considering the time
range, but start to affect the overall flow across the western and
central U.S. by around Tuesday. The evolution of these shortwaves
and differences in strength of an upper low rotating in the
eastern Pacific and approaching the Pacific Northwest Tuesday
cause downstream differences across the central U.S., in terms of
amplification of troughing moving through and with whether
shortwave energy combines or remains separate. A significant
amount of run to run variability (including with the newer 00Z
cycle coming in) and between models lead to low confidence. A
forecast mainly based on the ensemble means, which show troughing
across the central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday but not as amplified as
the 12Z ECMWF, seemed like the best starting point at this time.

Overall the WPC forecast utilized a multi-model blend of 12Z
deterministic guidance early in the period, favoring the 12Z GFS
more than the 18Z, and increasing usage of the 12Z EC and GEFS
ensemble means as the period progressed while lessening weighting
of the less agreeable deterministic models.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Some light rain may linger across eastern North Carolina into
Sunday and possibly over coastal areas of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast given the Atlantic surface low, but most precipitation
should stay offshore with this low track. Abundant moisture ahead
of frontal systems and upper-level shortwaves edging in from the
Pacific will result in periods of enhanced precipitation for much
of next week near the West Coast and inland. Through the period,
the Pacific Northwest and northern California can expect the
heaviest precipitation, with typical terrain enhancements and
higher elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with rain and mountain
snow threats increasing by Monday and especially Tuesday into
Wednesday. Then as a low pressure system is forecast to
consolidate in the Midwest by midweek, rain is expected to spread
to that area and south along its trailing cold front in the
Plains/Mississippi Valley. Chances for snow on the backside of
this low in the north-central U.S. will continue to be monitored.

Temperatures could remain slightly below normal on Sunday for the
Southeast due to a cold surface high to the west and the low
offshore bringing northerly winds. Meanwhile, a persistent
upper-level ridge over the west-central U.S. should lead to
temperatures that are above average by 10-20 degrees over the
Plains into the Midwest through early next week, with highs 5-10F
above normal stretching toward the East Coast by Tuesday-Thursday.
Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs modestly below normal
over the West Coast on most days, eventually entering into the
Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

...Series of Pacific storm systems to bring blustery winds, rain,
and high elevation snow to the Pacific Northwest, the Northern
Great Basin, and Northern Rockies...

...Quasi-stationary boundary to deliver heavy rain to portions of
Florida on Friday...

...Unseasonably cool temperatures across the South-Central and
Eastern US to begin bouncing back to normal as warmth from the
Western US spreads east...

A busy couple of days are in store for the Northwest quadrant of
the CONUS as a parade of Pacific storm systems pass through the
region, delivering rain and high elevation snow from the coast to
the Rockies. The first, which is expected to move onshore early
this morning, will be accompanied by high winds with strong gusts
that have the potential to reach 60 to 75 mph. These damaging
winds are forecast to occur over portions of northern California,
west-central Oregon, and eastern Washington, where scattered High
Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories are currently in effect. The
relatively moisture-rich cold front associated with this system
could deliver as much as 1-2+" of rain to low lying coastal areas
from northern California to the Olympic Peninsula as well as some
heavy snow to the Washington Cascades. As the front moves further
inland throughout the day light to moderate rain showers and the
coincident high elevation snow will also spread east into the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies. Without skipping a beat
the second system will reach the coastline Friday morning,
bringing with it another helping of rain and snow. Though
precipitation totals are not expected to be as high as those with
the previous system, a drop in snow levels to around 3000-4000 ft
will allow snow to accumulate at lower elevations throughout the
Cascades and the Olympic Mountains.

In the exact opposite corner of the country a quasi-stationary
boundary is setting up for an extended stay over Florida.
Remaining virtually motionless through Saturday, this boundary
will serve as the focus for the development of heavy rain and
thunderstorms, some of which may become severe and produce
damaging wind gusts. Rainfall totals across the state outside of
the Panhandle are expected to fall in the 1-2" range, with
isolated higher amounts possible over the eastern shoreline from
Palm Beach county to the Georgia border. Though soil moisture is
low throughout the peninsula due to recent below average rainfall,
isolated instances of flash flooding will be possible due to a
combination of these sizable rainfall accumulations and high
hourly rainfall rates.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably cool weather will persist
throughout the South-Central and Eastern US as surface high
pressure remains the dominant feature in these regions and
continues to draw cold air south. The greatest hit to daily
maximum temperatures will be felt in Texas and the Carolinas,
where highs are forecast to sit 20 to 25 degrees below normal,
struggling to escape the 50s and low 60s in Texas and the high 40s
and low 50s in the Carolinas. Furthermore, near to below freezing
overnight lows will be possible tonight from the Middle
Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic, where a mixture of Freeze
Watches and Warnings as well as Frost Advisories have been put
into effect. In stark contrast to the cold spell to the east,
upper-level ridging out West has allowed temperatures from the
West Coast to the Northern Plains to rise 10 to 20 degrees above
normal. As the ridge progresses eastward on Friday it will spread
the warm weather into the Upper Midwest and Central Plains while
also providing some relief to the Eastern US by pushing out the
cold and allowing temperatures to bounce back closer to average.

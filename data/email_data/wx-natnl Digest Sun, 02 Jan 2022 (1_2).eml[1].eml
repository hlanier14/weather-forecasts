...Multi-day coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy snow
threat for the Pacific Northwest and northern California to the
northern Great Basin/Rockies next week...
...Arctic blast to focus over the north-central U.S.
Tuesday-Friday with snow likely for the Great Lakes states through
the interior Northeast...


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A cold Canadian surface high will be in place across the eastern
U.S. on Tuesday in the wake of the strong cold front that will be
exiting the East Coast for the beginning of the week.  Surface
cyclogenesis ensues over the Northern Plains in response to an
amplifying upper trough, and another surge of arctic air behind
it.  A potentially strong low pressure system is on the horizon to
close out the week across the East Coast, and multiple
disturbances also take aim at the Pacific Northwest with an
atmospheric river event likely for portions of northern California
and southern Oregon.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00z model guidance suite appears to be in above average
agreement on the synoptic scale with more differences noted in
mesoscale features regarding the low pressure systems expected to
affect the continental U.S. through the middle of the week.  The
12Z UKMET strayed from the model consensus as early as Tuesday
night and even more so by Wednesday and Thursday across the Great
Lakes region, but the 00Z is more in line with the ECMWF/CMC/GEFS
mean.  The 00Z GFS is a bit south of the ensemble means with the
low crossing the Great Lakes Wednesday with a sharper shortwave
trough axis.  Regarding the next system, the CMC/GFS are favoring
a faster solution than the ECMWF.  The greatest model
uncertainties are evident over the eastern Pacific and West Coast
region by Friday and into Saturday with both northern and southern
stream shortwave energy breaking down the western U.S. ridge by
that time.

Taking these factors into account, the WPC forecast was primarily
based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend through early Thursday, and then
ECMWF/GFS/some CMC with gradually increasing use of the GEFS/ECENS
for Friday and Saturday.

...Sensible Weather and Hazards...

Heavy coastal rain and heavy mountain snow is expected from
northern California to western Washington for early to middle part
of the week as a storm system moves inland across the Pacific
Northwest, likely the result of an atmospheric river event.  This
moisture is expected to reach the central and northern Rockies
with heavy snow, mainly on Wednesday and Thursday.  Unlike recent
events, this storm is not currently expected to produce heavy
precipitation for central/southern California.  The surface low
over the north-central U.S. for Tuesday-Wednesday will likely have
a swath of light to moderate snow, and lake enhanced snow across
much of Michigan with some blowing/drifting snow as winds increase
with the arctic airmass moving into the region.  Depending on what
happens along the East Coast late in the week, moderate to locally
heavy rain for the Southeast U.S. and snow for the Appalachians
and portions of the Ohio Valley can be expected.

In the temperature department, there will be a return to
seasonably cold conditions across much of the Deep South and the
East Coast for early in the week after days of well above average
temperatures and humidity levels.  There is likely a brief
moderation across the Plains and Midwest states on Tuesday ahead
of the next arctic front, which will herald a return to frigid
conditions across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by
Wednesday and beyond, with highs running a good 15-30 degrees
below seasonal averages in many cases.  Portions of Montana may be
up to 40 degrees below normal by Wednesday!  This will equate to
subzero high temperatures once again across portions of northern
Montana, North Dakota, and northern Minnesota, with a few record
lows possible.  Wind chills will also reach hazardous levels for
these same areas, and wind chill related weather bulletins will
likely be needed for much of the north-central U.S. as the arctic
airmass settles into the region.  The good news is the severity of
the cold should moderate quite a bit by the time this airmass
reaches the East Coast, but still 5-15 degrees below average by
the end of the week for many areas.  Out West, readings are likely
to be within 10 degrees either side of average for most areas next
week west of the continental divide.

...An very active start to 2022 across large sections of the
nation...

...Heavy Snows possible from the Central Plains, Mid Mississippi
Valley into the Lower Great Lakes...

...Heavy Rains, Flash Flooding and Severe Thunderstorms possible
across the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley and Ohio
Valley...

...Much above average/record high temperatures expected from South
and eastern Texas, eastward across much of the East, while arctic
air surges southward through the Plains...

...Heavy Snows possible from the Southern Appalachians into the
southern Mid-Atlantic...

...Heavy precipitation to return to the Pacific Northwest late
Sunday into early Monday...


A very active weather pattern will ring in the New Year across
large sections of the nation. A developing storm system along a
strong frontal boundary stretching from the Southern Plains into
the Ohio Valley will produce a wide variety of weather for the
first weekend of 2022.  On the northern side of this storm, major
travel disruptions are likely as heavy snows will be spreading
northeastward from the Central Plains into the Mid Mississippi
Valley and Lower Great Lakes, with accumulations of 6 to 12 inches
likely from northeast Kansas to the Chicago Metro area.  To the
south of the heavy snow area,  significant freezing rain and sleet
are possible from eastern Kansas into central to northern Missouri
and west central Illinois.

Farther to the south of the widespread winter weather affects from
this storm, heavy rains, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms
are likely from portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
northeastward into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys.  Potentially
life-threatening flash flooding, tornadoes, high winds and large
hail are possible Saturday into Saturday night across these areas.

By late Sunday, a second storm system is forecast to develop along
this strong front across north Georgia and push offshore of
eastern North Carolina by early Monday.  This developing storm
does have the potential to produce accumulating heavy snows from
the Southern Appalachians of eastern Tennessee and western North
Carolina and eastward across sections of the Southern Mid-Atlantic
from northern North Carolina into southern Virginia.

The strong frontal boundary that these storms are forecast to
develop along will be separating much above average temperatures
across the eastern U.S. this weekend with much below average
temperatures surging southward across the Plains.  Record High
temperatures are forecast Saturday from South and eastern Texas,
across much of the Gulf Coast, the Southeast and Florida and from
Florida into the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday.  While record cold
temperatures are not expected this weekend, much colder air will
be pressing southward across the Plains Saturday and eastward
through the east Sunday into early Monday.  Many areas from South
and eastern Texas into the Gulf Coast that have the potential for
record highs this weekend will be 30 to 35 degrees colder once the
strong cold front pushes through these areas.

A very broad area of low pressure from the surface to upper levels
of the atmosphere will be developing this weekend over the
northeast Pacific.  This will bring a return to heavy
precipitation for the Pacific Northwest by late Sunday into early
Monday.  Lower elevation heavy rains and heavy mountain snows are
likely from the Washington/northern Oregon Cascades, westward to
the Washington/Oregon coasts.  This developing area of low
pressure over the northeast Pacific will be the start of an
overall wetter pattern for the Pacific Northwest for the first
full week of the New Year.

Happy New Year!

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CST Sat Jan 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move across the southern CONUS
Day2/Sunday trailing a cold front across much of the center of the
country. Behind the front, Arctic high pressure will bring a much
colder airmass with below freezing temperatures expected across much
of the Rockies and Plains. Gusty winds in proximity to the front may
support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions.
However, overall fire weather concerns are low given the cooler
temperatures and widespread precipitation.

...South Texas...
Breezy northerly winds are expected to develop behind a cold front
for a few hours across far south Texas day2/Sunday. Model soundings
show some enhanced mixing of the boundary layer beneath stronger
mid-level flow aloft from the aforementioned departing trough.
Surface gusts of 15-20 mph appear plausible through the afternoon.
Latest model guidance also shows overall humidity values will likely
struggle to reach elevated criteria as the cooler airmass settles in
across far south Texas. While diurnal RH will be marginal (20-30%),
some receptive fuels remain across this region given little recent
rainfall. Overall fire weather conditions appear fairly low end, but
at least a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions
will be possible given receptive fuels and gusty winds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CST Sat Jan 01 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
An intensifying mid-level trough accompanied by strong flow aloft is
forecast to move across the southern Rockies and Plains today. An
attendant cold front and subsequent gusty winds will quickly move
south through the southern Plains reaching southwest Texas by late
afternoon and early evening ushering in a much cooler airmass.
Showers and precipitation in the vicinity of the front are also
expected. A few hours of low surface humidity and strong winds ahead
of the front will likely support elevated fire weather potential
across portions of southwest Texas.

...Southwest Texas/Big Bend...
As the main upper trough approaches from the west early this
afternoon, strong height falls and flow aloft will overspread much
of West Texas. Augmented by the increasing flow aloft, low-level
flow fields are expected to be fairly robust through the afternoon.
Model guidance suggests sustained westerly winds of 20-30 mph with
higher gusts possible. The dry downslope direction will also support
low surface RH in the teens. Somewhat sheltered from the recent
precipitation, fuels remain mostly favorable across much of the
Texas big Bend. Given the overlap of gusty winds dry surface
conditions and receptive fuels, a few hours of elevated fire weather
potential will be possible. Conditions should improve rapidly in the
later afternoon and evening as the cold front moves through. A shift
in low-level winds to the north will result in cooler temperatures
and rapid RH recoveries overnight.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1035 AM CST Sat Jan 01 2022

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 01/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Sat Jan 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
An intensifying mid-level trough accompanied by strong flow aloft is
forecast to move across the southern Rockies and Plains today. An
attendant cold front and subsequent gusty winds will quickly move
south through the southern Plains reaching southwest Texas by late
afternoon and early evening ushering in a much cooler airmass.
Showers and precipitation in the vicinity of the front are also
expected. A few hours of low surface humidity and strong winds ahead
of the front will likely support elevated fire weather potential
across portions of southwest Texas.

...Southwest Texas/Big Bend...
As the main upper trough approaches from the west early this
afternoon, strong height falls and flow aloft will overspread much
of West Texas. Augmented by the increasing flow aloft, low-level
flow fields are expected to be fairly robust through the afternoon.
Model guidance suggests sustained westerly winds of 20-30 mph with
higher gusts possible. The dry downslope direction will also support
low surface RH in the teens. Somewhat sheltered from the recent
precipitation, fuels remain mostly favorable across much of the
Texas big Bend. Given the overlap of gusty winds dry surface
conditions and receptive fuels, a few hours of elevated fire weather
potential will be possible. Conditions should improve rapidly in the
later afternoon and evening as the cold front moves through. A shift
in low-level winds to the north will result in cooler temperatures
and rapid RH recoveries overnight.

...Multi-system coastal heavy rain and mountain focusing heavy
snow threat from the Pacific Northwest/northern California to the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies next week...
...Arctic blasts spread out from the north-central U.S. to fuel a
mid-later next week heavy snow threat from the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast with coastal storm genesis...

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A deepening storm will track from the northern Plains Tue to the
Great Lakes and eastern Canada Wed/Thu. Arctic air will dig across
the central then eastern U.S. behind the windy and precipitation
focusing low to include a threat of plowable snow from the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast, with trailing
frontal rains down to the Southeast. The snow threat is expected
to be exacerbated by lake effect, terrain lift and over the
Northeast by coastal storm genesis into Fri.

Meanwhile, multiple Pacific systems with moderate atmospheric
river blueprints will meanwhile take aim at the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA next week, that will fuel multi-day coastal
rainfall and terrain/mountain enhancing snows. Energies will work
inland across a snowy north-central Great Basin/Rockies where lift
will be further enhanced by post-frontal upslope.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty now seems lower
than normal through medium range time scales. A composite of well
clustered mass field guidance from the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 00
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean/UKMET/Canadian along with the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models seems to offer a good basis for the WPC
product suite for days 3-7 (Tue-next Sat) in a pattern with good
continuity. The composite tends to mitigate lingering embedded
system timing/strength differences and run to run variable lower
atmospheric temperature profiles consistent with predictability.
For example the blend addresses a 06 GFS that seems too warm in
the Arctic air over the northern Plains Day 4/Wed, the 00 UTC
Canadian seems too aggressive with northern High Plains Arctic air
Day 6/7, and recent ECMWF run to run temperature continuity has
overall been less than stellar.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0112 PM CST Sat Jan 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fuels across parts of South Texas are currently marginally dry (ERCs
around median values per TICC). It does appear probable that a few
hours of elevated fire weather will occur during the morning through
mid-afternoon. While ERCs may rebound to near the 70th percentile by
the end of the day, this would only leave a short period of greater
large fire potential. Pending fuel information showing drier fuels,
overall fire-weather concerns continue to appear localized.

..Wendt.. 01/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CST Sat Jan 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move across the southern CONUS
Day2/Sunday trailing a cold front across much of the center of the
country. Behind the front, Arctic high pressure will bring a much
colder airmass with below freezing temperatures expected across much
of the Rockies and Plains. Gusty winds in proximity to the front may
support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions.
However, overall fire weather concerns are low given the cooler
temperatures and widespread precipitation.

...South Texas...
Breezy northerly winds are expected to develop behind a cold front
for a few hours across far south Texas day2/Sunday. Model soundings
show some enhanced mixing of the boundary layer beneath stronger
mid-level flow aloft from the aforementioned departing trough.
Surface gusts of 15-20 mph appear plausible through the afternoon.
Latest model guidance also shows overall humidity values will likely
struggle to reach elevated criteria as the cooler airmass settles in
across far south Texas. While diurnal RH will be marginal (20-30%),
some receptive fuels remain across this region given little recent
rainfall. Overall fire weather conditions appear fairly low end, but
at least a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions
will be possible given receptive fuels and gusty winds.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat January 01 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower Mississippi Valleys and parts of
the Central Appalachians through Sunday morning...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and parts of the Southeast through
Sunday morning...

...Snow over the Great Lakes to Northern New England through
Sunday morning; Pockets of freezing rain over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley to the Northeast through Sunday morning...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average for the
Northern Intermountain Region, Great Basin, and Southwest and over
the Southern Plains to the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley, while
temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average from the
Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic...

A front extending from the Northeast southwestward to the Southern
Plains will slowly move eastward off the East Coast by Monday.
Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average for the
Northern Intermountain Region, Great Basin, and Southwest and over
the Southern Plains to the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley on the
north and western sides of the boundary.  East and south of the
front, temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average from
the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic through Sunday evening.
Moisture will pool along the boundary over the eastern third of
the country, adding in the development of showers and
thunderstorms along and ahead of the front from the Ohio Valley to
the Lower Mississippi Valley.  Due to the dynamics of the severe
thunderstorms, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and
parts of the Southeast through Sunday morning.

The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  However, there is a 10% or greater probability of
EF2-EF5 over parts of the Tennessee Valley and parts of the
Southeast.

Furthermore, heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower
Mississippi Valleys and parts of the Central Appalachians through
Sunday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create numerous
areas of flash flooding.  Furthermore, many streams may flood,
potentially affecting larger rivers through Sunday morning.

Additional hazards lay on the north side of the front as snow will
develop over the Great Lakes to Northern New England through
Sunday morning.  In addition, there will be areas of rain/freezing
rain along the rain/snow line from parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley to the Northeast through Sunday morning.

The severe thunderstorm threat will diminish to a Marginal Risk
over the Southeast on Sunday into Monday morning.

Similarly, the threat of excessive rainfall will also decrease on
Sunday as the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of Southeast through Monday morning.  However, the
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable.

The snow over the Northeast ends by Monday morning.

However, as the front moves off the Mid-Atlantic, snow will
develop over parts of the Tennessee Valley, Central Appalachians,
and on parts of the Piedmont on Monday.  The snow will be light
with minor accumulations.  However, with any form of snow or ice,
traveling will be more dangerous even with the littlest
accumulations.  The rain and snow will end over the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast by Monday evening.

Meanwhile, snow over parts of the Southern/Central Rockies onto
the Southern/Central Plains will wind down overnight Saturday.

On Sunday, a front will begin to come onshore over the Pacific
Northwest, moving inland to parts of the Northern Intermountain
Region by Monday.  Rain and higher elevation snow will develop
over parts of the Pacific Northwest on Sunday afternoon into
evening.  Coastal rain and higher elevation snow will develop over
parts of Northern California on Monday.  The Cascades will get
heavy snow.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
153 AM EST Sun Jan 2 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 5 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 9 2022

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain snow for
the northwestern states...
...Frigid air mass for the north-central U.S. and potential snow
for inland portions of the East Coast region late in the week...


...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level flow pattern over the nation will be rather
amplified through the end of the week with a large scale trough
over the east-central U.S. and a broad ridge over the West Coast,
before transitioning to a more quasi-zonal flow by next weekend.
Two well defined low pressure systems are expected to affect the
Great Lakes region and also the East Coast, and a third system is
possible by next weekend across the Plains and Midwest.  An arctic
air mass will settle southward across much of the north-central
U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front.

...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in excellent synoptic scale
agreement through the majority of the forecast period with some
mesoscale timing and amplitude differences with the individual
shortwave passages.  These minor differences are all within the
ensemble spread for the most part.  By Friday with the East Coast
system, the 00Z GFS is slightly farther offshore with the track of
the low and thus would be less impactful in terms of rain/snow
across the Northeast.  The CMC becomes faster with the shortwave
crossing the Plains by Saturday and also more amplified across the
Southeast, whereas the ECMWF/GFS suggest a flatter mid-upper flow
pattern here.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Thursday, and then GFS/ECMWF/some CMC along
with gradually increasing use of the ECENS and GEFS means through
next weekend.

...Sensible Weather...

The Great Lakes storm system is expected to produce widespread
light to moderate snow across Michigan and Wisconsin through early
Thursday, with some lake enhancement to the snow likely as the low
pulls away.  Winds may be strong enough in some places to produce
blizzard conditions.  For the system near the East Coast, there
has been a slightly southeastward trend in the axis of QPF, and
snow is likely for inland portions of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast and gusty winds near the coast.  Heavy coastal rain and
heavy mountain snow will continue to make weather headlines across
portions of the Pacific Northwest, and also across the northern
Rockies.

Temperatures are expected to be frigid across the central/northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of the week with a
large surface high of arctic origin governing the weather pattern
for this region.  Highs in the double digits below zero are once
again likely for portions of eastern Montana and into North
Dakota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as southern
Kansas on Thursday.  Some abatement in the severe cold may come to
pass across this region ahead of the next arctic surge next
Sunday.  Elsewhere, seasonably cold conditions are expected west
of the Continental Divide with readings generally within 10
degrees of climatological averages, and cold next weekend along
the East Coast with highs about 10 degrees below normal.

...Additional rounds of heavy coastal rain and mountain snow for
the northwestern states...
...Frigid air mass for the north-central U.S. and potential snow
for inland portions of the East Coast region late in the week...


...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level flow pattern over the nation will be rather
amplified through the end of the week with a large scale trough
over the east-central U.S. and a broad ridge over the West Coast,
before transitioning to a more quasi-zonal flow by next weekend.
Two well defined low pressure systems are expected to affect the
Great Lakes region and also the East Coast, and a third system is
possible by next weekend across the Plains and Midwest.  An arctic
air mass will settle southward across much of the north-central
U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front.

...Guidance assessment and uncertainty...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in excellent synoptic scale
agreement through the majority of the forecast period with some
mesoscale timing and amplitude differences with the individual
shortwave passages.  These minor differences are all within the
ensemble spread for the most part.  By Friday with the East Coast
system, the 00Z GFS is slightly farther offshore with the track of
the low and thus would be less impactful in terms of rain/snow
across the Northeast.  The CMC becomes faster with the shortwave
crossing the Plains by Saturday and also more amplified across the
Southeast, whereas the ECMWF/GFS suggest a flatter mid-upper flow
pattern here.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Thursday, and then GFS/ECMWF/some CMC along
with gradually increasing use of the ECENS and GEFS means through
next weekend.

...Sensible Weather...

The Great Lakes storm system is expected to produce widespread
light to moderate snow across Michigan and Wisconsin through early
Thursday, with some lake enhancement to the snow likely as the low
pulls away.  Winds may be strong enough in some places to produce
blizzard conditions.  For the system near the East Coast, there
has been a slightly southeastward trend in the axis of QPF, and
snow is likely for inland portions of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast and gusty winds near the coast.  Heavy coastal rain and
heavy mountain snow will continue to make weather headlines across
portions of the Pacific Northwest, and also across the northern
Rockies.

Temperatures are expected to be frigid across the central/northern
Plains to the Upper Midwest through the end of the week with a
large surface high of arctic origin governing the weather pattern
for this region.  Highs in the double digits below zero are once
again likely for portions of eastern Montana and into North
Dakota, and highs in the teens settling as far south as southern
Kansas on Thursday.  Some abatement in the severe cold may come to
pass across this region ahead of the next arctic surge next
Sunday.  Elsewhere, seasonably cold conditions are expected west
of the Continental Divide with readings generally within 10
degrees of climatological averages, and cold next weekend along
the East Coast with highs about 10 degrees below normal.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Tennessee Valley, Central/Southern Appalachians and Southeast
through today...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Tennessee Valley and Southeast through this morning...

...Heavy snow over parts of the interior Northeast today then
Pacific Northwest mountains on Monday...

...Mississippi Valley and Great Plains cool down while East Coast
experiences warm temperatures today...

A cold front, currently draped along the East coast, will be the
focus for heavy rain, snow and severe weather over the next couple
of days. The Southeast portion of the front is slow moving and
allowing for the development of a line of thunderstorms over
portions of the Southeast and the Tennessee Valley this morning.
Some of these storms may be severe, with damaging winds and
isolated tornadoes being the main threats. An Enhanced Risk of
severe weather is in effect as a result. Heavy rain is also
possible over much of the same area this morning, due to the slow
nature of the surface front leading to the potential for longer
duration rainfall. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in
effect for northern Alabama/Georgia, the Tennessee Valley and
Central/Southern Appalachians as a result. As the system moves
east today, so will the threat for flash flooding. A Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall is in effect for a small portion of southern
South Carolina and eastern Georgia today as the low pressure
system begins to strengthen. Scattered thunderstorms are also
expected across the Southeast. As this system deepens, it will
become more dynamic and pull cooler air into its northern
quadrant. This will lead to the potential for measurable snow to
accumulate over parts of the Mid-Atlantic tonight through Monday
morning. East Coast temperatures will be above average today
before giving way to more seasonal air behind the passing low
pressure system on Monday. Meanwhile, Below normal temperatures
are expected over much of the Mississippi Valley and Great Plains
today. A cold front moving across the Northeast will produce 3-6
inches of snow across parts of the interior Northeast today.

Troughing in the West will lead to heavy snow potential across the
Northwest mountains through Monday. A slow moving cold front will
produce 1-2 feet of snow for the northern Cascades and Olympic
Mountains today before shifting focus to the southern Cascades on
Monday where 2-4 feet is likely. Snow will also spread into the
northern Sierra and Northern Rockies on Monday where 6-12 inches
are likely. Coastal and low elevation rainfall is also likely with
this cold front, with isolated areas along the Northwest coast at
marginal risk of experiencing flash flooding.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CST Sun Jan 02 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
A deep mid-level trough is forecast to eject eastward across the
southern Plains and southeast today, while at the same time, a
strong cold front moves south toward the Gulf Coast. Gusty winds and
a much colder air mass are expected behind the front. However, dry
and breezy conditions may result in a few hours of elevated fire
weather potential across portions of far South Texas.

...South Texas...
In the wake of an early day cold front, strong north winds are
forecast to develop across much of southern Texas. Enhanced by
vertical mixing of strong winds aloft along the backside of the deep
upper trough, surface gusts of 25-30 mph will be possible through
mid afternoon. The rapid cooling and drying airmass should also
result in quickly falling humidity values through much of the day.
While diurnal minimums may struggle to reach elevated criteria, the
rapid drying may support elevated to near-elevated fire weather
conditions for a few hours. Highest confidence in 3+ hours of
elevated conditions appears to be farther west near the
international border where enhanced down sloping and the driest
fuels exist. Fire weather concerns will quickly abate later in the
afternoon and overnight as temperatures fall below freezing and
winds weaken.

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE TRANS PECOS AND BIG BEND
REGIONS OF SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

Critical fire weather conditions remain likely across portions of
southwest TX by early afternoon. Morning surface observations show a
cold front passing through the Lubbock, TX region, which is slightly
faster than depicted by most guidance. As a result, the northern
extent of the Elevated risk has been trimmed to exclude areas that
should not see prolonged fire weather conditions. To the southwest,
single digit dewpoints are noted over the Trans Pecos region, and
the 12Z MAF sounding reveals very dry conditions and 30-40 mph winds
within a deep, well-mixed residual layer above the nocturnal
inversion. Forecast soundings hint that the inversion should fully
mix out as temperatures approach the upper 60s to low 70s, which
should occur between 17Z to 19Z this afternoon. This will signal the
onset of more widespread critical conditions across the Trans
Pecos/Big Bend regions. Critical conditions are still expected
across the San Angelo/Sonora, TX region this afternoon as the
surface trough/dryline pushes east despite morning moisture
recovery.

To the north across northeast NM and the western Panhandles, cloud
cover and scattered showers are ongoing and should continue into
early afternoon. Although increasing pressure gradient winds up to
20-25 mph remain likely, widespread RH reductions below
elevated/critical thresholds remain improbable.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Mon Mar 14 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent mid-level jet will progress southeastward through parts of
the Southwest and into the southern Plains. At the surface, a weak
surface low will develop along a southward-moving cold front.

...Trans-Pecos and Big Bend Vicinity...
Strong surface winds are likely across southern New Mexico into the
Permian Basin, the Trans-Pecos, and the Big Bend. The mid-level jet
core will move overhead during peak boundary-layer mixing in the
afternoon. Surface winds of 20-30 mph will be possible along with
higher gusts. Given the somewhat weak low-level response to the
trough, widespread 30+ mph winds are not expected. RH is likely to
be near 10%, especially within the Trans-Pecos and Big Bend areas.
Elsewhere, 15-20% will be more common.

...Eastern New Mexico and Texas Panhandle/South Plains...
Post-frontal winds will be strong. 20-25 mph appears probable
through much of the day. RH will generally recover behind the front
and some light precipitation is possible. However, some areas will
warm sufficiently to lower RH to near 20%. Locally elevated
conditions may occur.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 PM CDT Mon Mar 14 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

The forecast remains on track for elevated fire weather conditions
across parts of central to western Nebraska and extreme southern
South Dakota. The Elevated risk area was expanded slightly based on
latest trends in both hi-res solutions and ensemble probabilities.
Further south along the CO/KS border into northeast NM, RH
reductions below 20% will be common, but confidence in the coverage
of 15-20 mph remains somewhat low given only modest lee troughing.
Areas of elevated conditions appear possible, but the overall
potential remains too patchy/spatially limited for a broader risk
area. Trends will continue to be monitored and Elevated risk
highlights may be needed if confidence in sufficient coverage of 15+
mph winds increases.

..Moore.. 03/14/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Mar 14 2022/

...Synopsis...
On Tuesday, flow aloft will become much more zonal for the central
and western portions of the country. At the surface winds are
generally expected to be light across areas with dry fuels. Some lee
troughing near the Rockies will support locally elevated conditions
across parts of the southern and central High Plains.

Farther north in northern Nebraska, a favorable overlap of warm
temperatures and windy conditions may occur. Model guidance has
shown a consistent signal for stronger surface to 2 km winds across
the area. ERC values are at record highs in some locations per RMCC
fuel guidance. Given today's fine fuel moisture observations, it
seems probable that an elevated fire weather threat will exist
during the afternoon as RH may fall near 20% with winds of 15-20
mph.

Extended Forecast Discussion

245 PM EDT Mon Mar 14 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 21 2022

1830 UTC Update...

No major changes to the forecast thinking from the overnight shift
following the 00z/06z model runs. The last few runs of the GFS
(including the most recent 12z run from today) continues to be
stronger with southern stream energy through the Plains/Midwest
late this week, resulting in a more wrapped, deeper, and farther
north surface low placement. Again, todays update to the WPC
forecast leaned more towards the better clustered ECMWF, CMC, and
UKMET solutions for this system. Elsewhere, an ECMWF/GFS blend
with the ensemble means seems to continue to serve well with the
next trough/closed low in the Southwest early next week amidst
good large scale agreement but plenty of detail uncertainties
still to be worked out. See previous discussion below for
additional information concerning the medium range period forecast
and associated weather/hazard threats.

Santorelli

...Previous Discussion issued at 0628 UTC...

...Overview...

A fast, progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to evolve over the CONUS throughout the forecast period.
The initial system over the Southeast Thursday will quickly depart
to the northeast offshore while another storm system brews over
the southern Plains Thursday/Friday before lifting into the Great
Lakes by next weekend. By late in the weekend to early next week,
a much stronger and amplified trough will progress through the
western U.S., reaching the Plains by early next week. This could
bring widespread, beneficial rains to the western U.S. and evolve
into a strong storm system just beyond the forecast period. No
significant cold air outbreaks are anticipated and temperatures
will generally oscillate between near normal and much above normal
ahead of the various waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
While large scale features in the latest deterministic and
ensemble guidance show average to above average predictability and
agreement, there are some notable surface differences that have
impacts on timing and sensible weather. Initially, the first area
of model differences lies with the neutrally titled shortwave
trough coming through the Plains late in the week. The associated
surface low has significant latitudinal differences with the GFS
being a fast, progressive and northern outlier compared to the
slower ECMWF/UKMET/CMC. This is largely driven by its deeper,
stronger 500 mb trough that takes on a slight negative tilt as it
swings through the Midwest. For now, the WPC blend favored the
slower, non-GFS solution but did include some of it to maintain
continuity. Beyond that system, the flow pattern takes on more
amplitude with the western U.S. likely to see a digging trough
that eventually closes off around the Four Corners region by the
end of the period. While there are some timing difference, both
the ECMWF/GFS and ECENS/GEFS means show fairly good agreement in
this setup. As the energy reaches the Plains, strong cyclogenesis
is possible. Overall, the WPC blend incorporated the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
and 18Z GFS for days 3-5 then included more of the ECENS/GEFS for
days 6-7 given the typical model spread.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The slow-moving Gulf to Southeast coastal system will bring
widespread light to moderate rainfall to the coastal regions
Thursday before the system moves well offshore into Friday. The
next system moving through the Plains could bring some moderate to
locally heavy rainfall as well as potential winter weather on the
northwest/cold side, though the aforementioned model differences
and marginally supportive thermal profiles for winter weather will
keep the latest Winter Weather Outlook for Day 5 generally very
low. Finally, the active/unsettled weather greeting the western
U.S. toward the end of the period will be mostly beneficial and
welcomed precipitation. Temperatures look to be mostly near to
above normal, ahead of the various waves of low pressure. Some
dips to below normal readings are possible across the West and
interior West as the next large scale weather system moves through
thanks to clouds and precipitation.

...Severe weather possible over Northeast Texas and the ArkLaTex
on Monday and across northern Florida through Tuesday morning...

...Critical fire weather conditions across portions of the
Southern High Plains today...

...Additional heavy precipitation possible across the Northwest
Monday into Tuesday and across northern Florida Tuesday into
Wednesday...

Temperatures across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic are starting to
moderate in the wake the winter storm system that brought a cold
blast and widespread snow to a last part of the eastern third of
the country. A wave of low pressure passing through the central
U.S. will produce a narrow swath of precipitation from
south-central Minnesota to northern Michigan, which will mostly be
in the form of snow with several inches of accumulation. Winter
Weather Advisories are in effect from eastern Minnesota to
northern Michigan. Periods of snow will reach northern New England
tonight with only minor accumulations expected.

Low pressure will strengthen as it moves east from the Southern
Plains, triggering scattered to widespread showers and
thunderstorms across the ArkLaTex region. SPC has identified the
threat for damaging winds, large hail and potentially tornadoes
with these storms and have a Slight Risk in effect through Tuesday
morning. In addition to the potential severe weather, periods of
heavy rainfall is expected across much of the Deep South with
areal averages of at least 1 inch. As this system progresses to
the east along the Gulf Coast so will the threat for severe storms
and heavy rain. Strong-to-severe storms are likely from the mouth
of the Mississippi River to south-central Florida with damaging
winds and tornadoes/water spouts possible. Some storms may also
produce excessive rainfall rates, prompting the issuance of a
Marginal Risk for flash flooding in parts of northern and central
Florida on Tuesday.

Dry conditions will linger across portions of southern New Mexico
and the adjacent Southern High Plains. Low humidity and high wind
gusts will keep much of West Texas and Southeast New Mexico with
an elevated risk for the development/spread of wildfires. SPC has
this part of the country highlighted as having a Critical Risk for
fire weather; local forecast offices also have a few Red Flag
warnings. The threat is expected to lessen on Tuesday. Further
north across the Central Plains favorable fire weather conditions
will return; SPC has an Elevated Risk for parts of northern
Nebraska on Tuesday. The Pacific Northwest will be wet and
unsettled over the next few days as two Pacific storm systems move
inland and spread 1 to 2 inches of precipitation to the Coastal
Range of California and western Oregon. The higher elevations of
the Cascades, Olympics, Sawtooths, Bitterroots, and northern
Rockies of western Montana could see a few inches of snow. The
heaviest totals are forecast in the Washington Cascades where two
the three feet of snow is possible in the highest elevations over
the next couple days.

Across the nation most of the temperatures will moderate and begin
to feel more like Spring. Daily highs will be 15 to 25 degrees
warmer than seasonal average from the Texas Panhandle to the Lower
Great Lake by Wednesday. In contrast, the Northwest and the
Central Rockies will be chilly given the active storms and
precipitation. Look for the warming trend to reach the East Coast
by Wednesday with highs in the 60s throughout the Mid-Atlantic.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon March 14 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 20 - 24 2022

Today's model solutions are in general good agreement on the predicted 500-=
hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A strong ridge is favored over the Bering Sea and downstre=
am
troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast across t=
he
Gulf of Alaska, extending north to Mainland Alaska. A ridge and associated
above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the North Pacific extending
eastward to the western CONUS. Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights a=
re
predicted across the central CONUS. Above normal heights associated with
ridging are forecast over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are also likely for parts of the Rockies and Four
Corner regions underneath enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Broad, low
amplitude flow and above normal heights lead to increased odds of above nor=
mal
temperatures for parts of the southwestern CONUS. Ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of above normal temperatures for mo=
st
of the eastern and central CONUS, supported by most of the dynamical foreca=
st
tools. Near to below normal temperatures are likely for Mainland Alaska and
the
Aleutians, associated with predicted deep troughing. Above normal temperatu=
res
are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the consolidation
temperatures tool.

Below normal precipitation is likely for most of western and central Mainla=
nd
Alaska, and the Aleutians, downstream of a ridge predicted over the Bering
Sea,
while above normal precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle and pa=
rts
of southeastern Mainland Alaska due to the troughing. Below normal
precipitation is most likely for much of the southwestern CONUS and parts o=
f
the Southern Plains, well to the south of the predicted mean storm track.
Above
normal precipitation is favored for most of the central and eastern CONUS, =
due
to a predicted trough over the central CONUS and potential for return flow
moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high pressure forecast
over
the Atlantic.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About Average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 22 - 28 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the predicted week-2 mean 500-hPa circulation
pattern features ridging over the Bering Sea and troughing across the Gulf =
of
Alaska, extending north to southern Mainland Alaska. Downstream, ridging an=
d
associated above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over much of the west=
ern
CONUS. Conversely, below normal heights associated with troughing are forec=
ast
over the eastern CONUS.

Near to below normal temperatures are likely for Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, associated with predicted troughing. Above normal temperatures a=
re
forecast over the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the consolidation
temperatures tool. Elevated probabilities of near to above normal temperatu=
res
are likely over much of the CONUS except for parts of southern Texas where
below normal temperatures are favored.

A drier pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across northwestern Mainl=
and
Alaska downstream of the ridging over the Bering Sea. Elevated probabilitie=
s
of
above normal precipitation are favored over the southeastern Mainland Alask=
a
and Alaska Panhandle due to predicted troughing. Below normal precipitation=
 is
most likely for much of the southwestern CONUS and parts of the Southern an=
d
Central Plains associated with predicted ridging and above normal 500-hPa
heights. Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONU=
S,
due to a predicted trough over the eastern CONUS and potential for return f=
low
moisture advecting northward to the west of surface high pressure forecast
over
the Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About Average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

SYNOPSIS: A stormy pattern early in the period will bring the potential for
several Hazards, primarily associated with a strong storm system exiting th=
e
Midwest early in the period. There is a potential for high winds in the wak=
e
of
the system across the Plains, and for much below normal temperatures farthe=

southwest as the strong storm pulls cold air unusually far south. Meanwhile=
,
northerly winds to the south and east of the storm could pull moisture from
the
Gulf of Mexico into parts of the Southeast and lower Ohio Valley, resulting=
 in
heavy precipitation. Elsewhere, the gradient between a deep storm system in
the
North Pacific and higher surface pressures in western Canada will bring a r=
isk
for high winds to parts of the Alaska Panhandle, and Washington Cascades ha=

an increased threat of heavy precipitation from a strong, moist flow from t=

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 22 - MONDAY MARCH 28: All models and ensemble suites
strongly
agree that week-2 will begin with a potent storm centered over the central
Great Plains. As this system moves northeastward toward Canada on March 22 =
and
23, it will bring enhanced chances of several hazards to different parts of
the
CONUS. In the wake of the storm, most operational models and re-forecast
products show high winds in the central and western Plains, driven by the
strong surface pressure gradient between the exiting storm system and
significantly higher pressures over the interior West. The GEFS and Europea=
n
ensemble re-forecasts are not as robust as other tools in depicting this
scenario, but still imply some increased winds.



Farther west, surface winds won=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt be as strong ac=
ross the Four Corners
States
and some adjacent areas, but most models indicate that the Midwestern storm
system will pull much below normal temperatures into the Southwest, with mo=
st
of the region dropping below freezing. The European ensemble re-forecast to=
ol
does not bring cold air that far south, but other tools, including the
operational European model, bring the cold air closer to the Mexican border=
,
and this scenario is favored.



To the east and south of the storm system, most tools bring unusually stron=
g
and moist low-level flow into the lower Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, and
portions of the Southeast. But while tools agree on this general scenario,
there is some disagreement in the details. The operational GFS and the
European
models are in good agreement bringing heavy precipitation into the Ohio and
Mississippi Valley as week-2 begins, then brings it eastward and southward
over
the next couple of days. Meanwhile, the re-forecast tools keep the heaviest
precipitation no farther north than the Tennessee Valley, as does the
operational Canadian model. Given the strength of both the surface storm an=
d
trailing cold front, the heavy precipitation farther north is preferred. Ne=
ar
the middle of week-2, many tools bring heavy precipitation to southern
Mississippi and Alabama, and again this scenario is favored given the storm
strength and a moderately strong frontal boundary.



Early in the period, cold air in place across Alaska will result in much be=
low
normal temperatures across parts of the central and western Mainland. Most
tools bring more moderate temperatures into the region over the next couple=
 of
days, ending the cold weather hazard. The re-forecast tools and some
operational models bring 50 percent chances for temperatures below zero deg=
. F
to the northern half of the region.



At the same time, a strong storm system will be west of the Alaska Panhandl=
e.
Operational models almost unanimously show surface pressures below 980 mb a=
t
the center of this system, and the gradient between this system and high
pressure in western Canada bring the threat for high winds to the southern =
and
western parts of the Alaska Panhandle. A minority of tools bring another
strong
system toward the region late in week-2, but there is not enough agreement =
on
this scenario to introduce any hazards at this time.



South of the North Pacific low pressure area, a strong onshore flow of mois=
t
air will cover the Pacific Northwest. But while above normal, most tools ke=
ep
amounts below the hazards thresholds, except in the Washington Cascades. Th=
e
combination of the strong, moist flow into the region, and orographic lifti=
ng
that will occur as the air flows onto the west side of the Cascades, should
bring enhanced chances for above normal precipitation to the higher elevati=
ons
there.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
433 PM EDT Mon Mar 14 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 21 2022

1830 UTC Update...

No major changes to the forecast thinking from the overnight shift
following the 00z/06z model runs. The last few runs of the GFS
(including the most recent 12z run from today) continues to be
stronger with southern stream energy through the Plains/Midwest
late this week, resulting in a more wrapped, deeper, and farther
north surface low placement. Again, todays update to the WPC
forecast leaned more towards the better clustered ECMWF, CMC, and
UKMET solutions for this system. Elsewhere, an ECMWF/GFS blend
with the ensemble means seems to continue to serve well with the
next trough/closed low in the Southwest early next week amidst
good large scale agreement but plenty of detail uncertainties
still to be worked out. See previous discussion below for
additional information concerning the medium range period forecast
and associated weather/hazard threats.

Santorelli

...Previous Discussion issued at 0628 UTC...

...Overview...

A fast, progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to evolve over the CONUS throughout the forecast period.
The initial system over the Southeast Thursday will quickly depart
to the northeast offshore while another storm system brews over
the southern Plains Thursday/Friday before lifting into the Great
Lakes by next weekend. By late in the weekend to early next week,
a much stronger and amplified trough will progress through the
western U.S., reaching the Plains by early next week. This could
bring widespread, beneficial rains to the western U.S. and evolve
into a strong storm system just beyond the forecast period. No
significant cold air outbreaks are anticipated and temperatures
will generally oscillate between near normal and much above normal
ahead of the various waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
While large scale features in the latest deterministic and
ensemble guidance show average to above average predictability and
agreement, there are some notable surface differences that have
impacts on timing and sensible weather. Initially, the first area
of model differences lies with the neutrally titled shortwave
trough coming through the Plains late in the week. The associated
surface low has significant latitudinal differences with the GFS
being a fast, progressive and northern outlier compared to the
slower ECMWF/UKMET/CMC. This is largely driven by its deeper,
stronger 500 mb trough that takes on a slight negative tilt as it
swings through the Midwest. For now, the WPC blend favored the
slower, non-GFS solution but did include some of it to maintain
continuity. Beyond that system, the flow pattern takes on more
amplitude with the western U.S. likely to see a digging trough
that eventually closes off around the Four Corners region by the
end of the period. While there are some timing difference, both
the ECMWF/GFS and ECENS/GEFS means show fairly good agreement in
this setup. As the energy reaches the Plains, strong cyclogenesis
is possible. Overall, the WPC blend incorporated the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
and 18Z GFS for days 3-5 then included more of the ECENS/GEFS for
days 6-7 given the typical model spread.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The slow-moving Gulf to Southeast coastal system will bring
widespread light to moderate rainfall to the coastal regions
Thursday before the system moves well offshore into Friday. The
next system moving through the Plains could bring some moderate to
locally heavy rainfall as well as potential winter weather on the
northwest/cold side, though the aforementioned model differences
and marginally supportive thermal profiles for winter weather will
keep the latest Winter Weather Outlook for Day 5 generally very
low. Finally, the active/unsettled weather greeting the western
U.S. toward the end of the period will be mostly beneficial and
welcomed precipitation. Temperatures look to be mostly near to
above normal, ahead of the various waves of low pressure. Some
dips to below normal readings are possible across the West and
interior West as the next large scale weather system moves through
thanks to clouds and precipitation.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
433 PM EDT Mon Mar 14 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 17 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 21 2022

1830 UTC Update...

No major changes to the forecast thinking from the overnight shift
following the 00z/06z model runs. The last few runs of the GFS
(including the most recent 12z run from today) continues to be
stronger with southern stream energy through the Plains/Midwest
late this week, resulting in a more wrapped, deeper, and farther
north surface low placement. Again, todays update to the WPC
forecast leaned more towards the better clustered ECMWF, CMC, and
UKMET solutions for this system. Elsewhere, an ECMWF/GFS blend
with the ensemble means seems to continue to serve well with the
next trough/closed low in the Southwest early next week amidst
good large scale agreement but plenty of detail uncertainties
still to be worked out. See previous discussion below for
additional information concerning the medium range period forecast
and associated weather/hazard threats.

Santorelli

...Previous Discussion issued at 0628 UTC...

...Overview...

A fast, progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to evolve over the CONUS throughout the forecast period.
The initial system over the Southeast Thursday will quickly depart
to the northeast offshore while another storm system brews over
the southern Plains Thursday/Friday before lifting into the Great
Lakes by next weekend. By late in the weekend to early next week,
a much stronger and amplified trough will progress through the
western U.S., reaching the Plains by early next week. This could
bring widespread, beneficial rains to the western U.S. and evolve
into a strong storm system just beyond the forecast period. No
significant cold air outbreaks are anticipated and temperatures
will generally oscillate between near normal and much above normal
ahead of the various waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
While large scale features in the latest deterministic and
ensemble guidance show average to above average predictability and
agreement, there are some notable surface differences that have
impacts on timing and sensible weather. Initially, the first area
of model differences lies with the neutrally titled shortwave
trough coming through the Plains late in the week. The associated
surface low has significant latitudinal differences with the GFS
being a fast, progressive and northern outlier compared to the
slower ECMWF/UKMET/CMC. This is largely driven by its deeper,
stronger 500 mb trough that takes on a slight negative tilt as it
swings through the Midwest. For now, the WPC blend favored the
slower, non-GFS solution but did include some of it to maintain
continuity. Beyond that system, the flow pattern takes on more
amplitude with the western U.S. likely to see a digging trough
that eventually closes off around the Four Corners region by the
end of the period. While there are some timing difference, both
the ECMWF/GFS and ECENS/GEFS means show fairly good agreement in
this setup. As the energy reaches the Plains, strong cyclogenesis
is possible. Overall, the WPC blend incorporated the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
and 18Z GFS for days 3-5 then included more of the ECENS/GEFS for
days 6-7 given the typical model spread.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The slow-moving Gulf to Southeast coastal system will bring
widespread light to moderate rainfall to the coastal regions
Thursday before the system moves well offshore into Friday. The
next system moving through the Plains could bring some moderate to
locally heavy rainfall as well as potential winter weather on the
northwest/cold side, though the aforementioned model differences
and marginally supportive thermal profiles for winter weather will
keep the latest Winter Weather Outlook for Day 5 generally very
low. Finally, the active/unsettled weather greeting the western
U.S. toward the end of the period will be mostly beneficial and
welcomed precipitation. Temperatures look to be mostly near to
above normal, ahead of the various waves of low pressure. Some
dips to below normal readings are possible across the West and
interior West as the next large scale weather system moves through
thanks to clouds and precipitation.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1236 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
Flow aloft across much of the West and Plains will become more zonal
today. A low-amplitude trough in the northern Rockies will spur lee
troughing across the High Plains region. The pressure gradient will
be stronger to the north and weaken with southward extent. In the
wake of a weak cold front, dry air will be in place across the
Plains.

...Nebraska...
Dry and windy conditions are expected during the afternoon. Given
the proximity to the stronger low-level troughing, greater surface
to 2 km winds are expected. Sustained winds will likely reach 15-20
mph, though 20-25 mph winds may occur locally for a brief time. RH
varies within guidance, but areas with as low as 15-20% are
possible. With that said, locally critical fire weather is certainly
possible, particularly within the Sand Hills vicinity. Otherwise,
elevated to near critical conditions are expected on a broader basis
due to very dry fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Though surface troughing will not be overly strong, 15 mph winds are
forecast nearly uniformly by guidance along and near the
Kansas-Colorado border. Due to the potential for RH of 10-15% over
very dry fuels, elevated fire weather concerns will exist during the
afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 AM CDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will approach the Southwest during the
afternoon on Wednesday. At the surface, a southern High Plains low
will develop through the day. This low will shift south and east
with time.

...Southwest...
Portions of southeastern Arizona into southern New Mexico are most
likely to experience meteorologically critical conditions given the
proximity to the mid-level jet. Winds near 20 mph are probable along
with 10-20% RH. With fuels only near seasonally normal dryness,
potential for large fires will be mitigated to some extent. Critical
highlights will be withheld for that reason.

...Southern Plains...
The deepening surface low in within the Texas Panhandle should aid
in 15-20 mph winds occurring across a broad portion of western Texas
into western Oklahoma. Slightly higher speeds may occur due to
terrain enhancement or stronger 850 mb winds in Oklahoma. RH will
range from 10% in western Texas to near 25% in western/central
Oklahoma. Lack of stronger winds precludes critical highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 AM EDT Tue Mar 15 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 18 2022 - 12Z Tue Mar 22 2022

...Overview...

A relatively progressive flow pattern with increasing amplitude is
expected to be in place across the continental U.S. through the
upcoming weekend.  The initial system over the Central Plains
Friday will be tracking northeastward to the Great Lakes and then
the Northeast through Sunday.  By late in the weekend to next
Monday, a much stronger and amplified trough will progress across
the western U.S., and then reaching the Plains by late Monday and
into Tuesday, with the overall pattern becoming a bit less
progressive by then.  This will likely bring widespread,
beneficial rains to the western U.S., and evolve into a
potentially strong storm system by the end of the forecast period.
 No significant arctic air intrusions are currently expected, and
temperatures will generally oscillate between near normal and well
above normal ahead of the various waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, the 12Z model guidance suite indicates good synoptic
scale agreement on the main features of interest, including the
large upper level trough developing over the Intermountain West
and then the Plains early next week.  However, it is worth noting
that the past few runs of the GFS have been to the northwest of
the model consensus with the surface low tracking across the Ohio
Valley and Great Lakes region during the Friday to Saturday time
period, with the latest run edging closer to the preferred
ECMWF/CMC/UKMET cluster of solutions.  The GFS is also slightly
stronger with the amplifying western trough, but similar in regard
to timing.  The associated surface low that evolves over the
Central Plains will likely be on the stronger side of the model
guidance, and the GFS probably captures the intensity best
compared to the slightly weaker CMC/ECMWF solutions.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The next system moving across the Plains could bring some moderate
to locally heavy rainfall as well as potential winter weather on
the northwest/cold side of the low, though the aforementioned
model differences and marginally supportive thermal profiles for
winter weather will keep the latest Winter Weather Outlook for Day
4 generally low.  Finally, the active/unsettled weather for the
western U.S. toward the end of the weekend and early next week
will be mostly beneficial and welcomed precipitation across
drought stricken areas.  There will be the potential for heavy
rain to develop across portions of the Southern Plains early next
week as this storm system taps into increasing Gulf moisture.
Temperatures look to be mostly near to above normal, ahead of the
various waves of low pressure.  Some dips to below normal readings
are possible across the West and interior West as the next large
scale weather system moves through owing to clouds and
precipitation.

to locally heavy rainfall as well as potential winter weather on
the northwest/cold side of the low, though the aforementioned
model differences and marginally supportive thermal profiles for
winter weather will keep the latest Winter Weather Outlook for Day
4 generally low.  Finally, the active/unsettled weather for the
western U.S. toward the end of the weekend and early next week
will be mostly beneficial and welcomed precipitation across
drought stricken areas.  There will be the potential for heavy
rain to develop across portions of the Southern Plains early next
week as this storm system taps into increasing Gulf moisture.
Temperatures look to be mostly near to above normal, ahead of the
various waves of low pressure.  Some dips to below normal readings
are possible across the West and interior West as the next large
scale weather system moves through owing to clouds and
precipitation.

...Severe weather and heavy rain along the central Gulf Coast and
in the Southeast...

...Pacific storm system ushers unsettled weather pattern into the
Northwest and the Rockies...

...April-like warmth returns to the Heartland, Great Lakes, and
Northeast; Elevated Risks for fire weather in the southern and
central High Plains...

An upper level low and associated frontal system is responsible
for scattered showers and thunderstorms traversing the Deep South
this morning. This upper low will continue to spawn additional
showers and thunderstorms along the central Gulf Coast and
eventually reaching Florida by Tuesday evening. Some thunderstorms
could be severe with damaging wind gusts and tornadoes the primary
modes of severe hazards possible. By Wednesday, the storm system
will track into the Southeast where rounds of showers and
thunderstorms will stretch from southern Virginia on south into
South Florida. Severe storms could develop in parts of the
Southeast with damaging winds and tornadoes possible Wednesday
afternoon and evening. The severe threat begins to diminish by
Thursday morning as the storm system's warm sector moves offshore,
but lingering showers are anticipated in the southern
Mid-Atlantic. In total, through early Thursday morning, most areas
from the central Gulf Coast to the Carolinas can expect 1 to 2
inches of rainfall with localized totals surpassing 2 inches where
the most intense convection transpires.

Farther west, a Pacific disturbance is directing Pacific moisture
at the Northwest and northern California. Precipitation will fall
in the form of snow in the Cascades with accumulations exceeding a
foot expected in the highest elevations. Rain will be the primary
precipitation type in the lower elevations and coastal areas of
the Pacific Northwest today and into tonight. As the upper level
feature tracks inland on Tuesday, so will the shield of
precipitation with mountain snow/valley rain moving into the
northern Rockies and northern Great Basin Tuesday evening. By
Wednesday, the upper trough deepens in the central Rockies,
leading to mountain snow breaking out in the central Rockies late
Wednesday into early Thursday. By Thursday morning, portions of
the Sawtooths, Bitterroots, Tetons, and the Rockies of western
Wyoming and central Colorado, can expect 6 to 12 inches of snow
with the nighest amounts expected in the more northern mountain
ranges.

Temperature-wise, a surge of above normal temperatures arrive in
the Nation's Heartland today and Wednesday. Daytime highs will
soar into the 60s and 70s in the Great Plains today with more 70s
and even 80s popping up in parts of the Southern Plains by
Wednesday. A warming trend is also expected in the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley, and Northeast with daytime highs ranging between 10
to 20 degrees above normal. Warmer than normal temperatures are
also on tap in the Desert Southwest while seasonally colder
temperatures settle in across the Northwest. In terms of fire
weather, dry conditions and occasionally gusty winds are favoring
Elevated Risks for fire weather in the central High Plains today,
then into the Southern High Plains on Wednesday.

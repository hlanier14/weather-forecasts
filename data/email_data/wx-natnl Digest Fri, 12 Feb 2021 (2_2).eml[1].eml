...Steadfast dome of Frigid Arctic air to remain entrenched across
the central U.S. and continue expanding south...

...A series of winter storms to result in heavy snow accumulations
from the Northwest to the Midwest this weekend...

...Icy conditions possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley to
the Mid-Atlantic, showers and thunderstorms in the Southeast...

A strong area of high pressure has an icy grip on much of the
northern tier of the Lower 48 as an intrusion of Arctic air races
south into the Southern Plains. Sub-zero high temperatures are on
tap in the northern Rockies and High Plains with some areas seeing
morning lows both Friday and Saturday morning between -20 and -30
degrees. Daily temperature departures in the North Central U.S.
will range between 30 to 40 degrees below normal. In addition,
wind chills remain dangerously cold ranging between -40 and -55
degrees across the Northern Plains. Wind Chill Advisories extend
as far south as Oklahoma with wind chills as low as -10 degrees
possible through Saturday. The Pacific Northwest will also contend
with bitterly cold temperatures as some locations challenge daily
record cold max temperatures today. In fact, much of the central
U.S. from the Dakotas to Texas could witness many broken daily
record low max temperatures through the upcoming weekend.

The expansive dome of sub-freezing temperatures across the
northern tier of the country has laid the foundation for winter
storms to wreak havoc from coast-to-coast not only going into this
weekend, but also into next week. Today, periods of snow will
blanket portions of the Northwest, the Intermountain West, and
Midwest. The heaviest snowfall is anticipated in the Cascades,
Tetons, and Colorado Rockies with accumulations over a foot
possible. While lesser totals would occurs in parts of the
Northwest and central Plains, totals of 3 to 6 inches could lead
to hazardous travel conditions. This has resulted in the issuance
of Winter Weather Advisories in these areas. By Saturday, a
Pacific storm system slamming into the Pacific Northwest generates
heavy snow and ice accumulations from Portland to Seattle. Pacific
moisture out ahead of the storm system reaches the Sierra Nevada,
Great Basin, and Intermountain West where periods of heavy
mountain snow are likely. Hazardous travel conditions by both
ground and air are expected in these areas into the upcoming
weekend.

In the East, a quasi-stationary front with waves of low pressure
along them produces areas of showers along the Gulf Coast and in
the Southeast. Farther north, precipitation is forecast to fall in
the form snow or a wintry mix over parts of the Mid-Atlantic.
Light ice accumulations in parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley
and the Piedmont of northern North Carolina and southern Virginia
could lead to slick travel conditions this morning. By Saturday, a
more consolidated area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico
directs its rich moisture source northeast towards the
Mid-Atlantic. In the warm sector, scattered showers and
thunderstorms will engulf much of the Southeast. A few
thunderstorms could be severe at times over northern Florida. As
the precipitation shield overruns sub-freezing air at the surface
in the northern Mid-Atlantic, a wintry mix of snow/sleet/freezing
rain will make for potentially treacherous travel conditions
Saturday afternoon. Ice accumulations on the order of a tenth to
as much as a quarter inch of ice are possible through Saturday
evening

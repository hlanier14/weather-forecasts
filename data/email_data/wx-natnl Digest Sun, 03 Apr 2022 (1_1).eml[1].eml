Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sat Apr 02 2022

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

Morning guidance shows elevated winds and relative humidity
extending north and east of the ongoing elevated area. Expanded the
elevated delineation northward into the western Oklahoma Panhandle,
but only expanded it slightly east across the Texas Panhandle due to
some rainfall over the central and eastern Texas Panhandle in the
past 24 hours.

..Bentley.. 04/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CDT Sat Apr 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain limited to the southern High
Plains today. A progressive upper-level disturbance over the
Southern Plains in early-morning water vapor imagery continues to
move to the east/southeast, leaving clearing skies and surface high
pressure in its wake over the southern High Plains. This surface
high will gradually shift east by mid afternoon, and modest surface
pressure falls are expected along the lee of the Rockies under a
weak zonal flow regime aloft. This will support a gradual increase
in south/southwesterly pressure-gradient winds across eastern
NM/west TX. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely and may
gust up to 20-30 mph at times. Poor moisture recovery into the
region will maintain depressed dewpoints and afternoon RH reductions
into the 15-20% range. While parts of far eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle received wetting rainfall over the past 24 hours, most
locations south of I-40 remain dry and have receptive fuels that
should support a fire weather concern.

Localized elevated conditions may develop in the lee of the central
Rockies across WY and southern MT as downslope winds increase to
15-20 mph late in the afternoon. These conditions are expected to be
relatively brief and will occur over areas with only marginally dry
fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 PM CDT Sat Apr 02 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL
NEBRASKA...FAR NORTHEAST COLORADO...AND FAR NORTHWEST KANSAS...

Expanded the critical are slightly south and east where strongest
winds are expected to overlap low-relative humidity. Winds are
strongest, but relative humidity the highest, in the northern part
of the critical area with lighter winds but lower relative humidity
and higher temperatures with southern extent. Tried to cover the
region which has the best combination of both, but there is
certainly a fair amount of uncertainty on the fringes of the current
critical area.

In addition, expanded the elevated area southward into the OK/TX
Panhandles. Winds of 15 to 25 mph with relative humidity around 20
percent is expected.

Also considered adding an isolated dry thunderstorm delineation for
parts of West Texas. High-based thunderstorms are expected to
develop late tomorrow afternoon/early evening. Initially, storms
will likely be on the drier side before becoming better organized
and moving into a higher PWAT airmass with eastern extent. Fuels in
this region are very dry with ERC percentiles around 90 to 95
percent. In addition, these storms will likely contain gusty/erratic
winds due to evaporative cooling in the dry air below the high
cloud-based. However, despite these factors which could be favorable
for isolated dry thunderstorms, storm speeds will be relatively
slow, and enough upscale growth/organization may occur for wetting
rains. Will continue to monitor this threat in later outlooks and
may add an IsoDryT delineation if dry storms appear more likely.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0207 AM CDT Sat Apr 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase across parts of the Great Plains
and southern High Plains Sunday afternoon as a surface low and
attendant lee trough migrate across the northern MO River Valley.
Localized fire concerns are possible across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic where dry conditions are likely within an offshore flow
regime.

...Nebraska...
A compact upper-level trough, noted in early-morning water vapor
imagery moving onto the Pacific Northwest coast, is forecast to
quickly propagate eastward into the northern Plains through the day.
An attendant surface low will likely migrate from the lee of the
northern Rockies into the upper MO River Valley by Sunday evening
with a trailing surface trough to the south/southwest. The
northwesterly flow regime behind the trough will spread a
continental air mass over the Plains. While there is some spread in
ensemble guidance regarding afternoon highs and associated RH
reductions, these flow regimes tend to verify on the warmer side of
ensemble temperature distributions due to downslope warming/drying.
As such, drier solutions that depict widespread RH reductions into
the 15-25% range appear more probable. Such low RH, combined with
sustained winds near 20 mph and unseasonably high ERC values, will
support critical fire weather conditions across western to central
NE. Elevated conditions appear likely in adjacent Plains states, and
may extend well into western KS (though confidence in this potential
is somewhat low).

...Southern High Plains...
While a more robust surface low is expected to the north across the
Plains, a weaker lee cyclone will likely begin to deepen across
eastern NM/west TX by the late afternoon hours. Ensemble guidance
shows reasonably high probability for 15-20 mph southwesterly winds
across southern/southeast NM in response to the deepening low. Dry
trajectories from northern Mexico, combined with downslope
warming/drying, should support areas of elevated fire weather
conditions in the lee of terrain features. Elevated conditions may
be more widespread and extend into western TX, but this will be
conditional on the placement and strength of the surface low.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry conditions with northwesterly offshore flow are expected along
the East Coast in the wake of a cold frontal passage Sunday
afternoon. Although winds will generally be weak (5-10 mph with
localized gusts to 15 mph), RH values will likely fall below 25%,
especially in the lee of the Blue Ridge mountains. 10-hour fuels
across NC and VA remain dry and ERC estimates are well above the
90th percentile, which may support at least a localized fire weather
concern.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 PM EDT Sat Apr 2 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 5 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 9 2022

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to extend into the
Southeast next Tuesday...

19Z Update:  Very good synoptic scale agreement in the 12Z
deterministic guidance continues with the amplifying trough and
evolving closed upper low over the north-central U.S. through the
end of next week, with only minor mesoscale differences noted in
the smaller scale perturbations pivoting around the main trough.
Therefore, a multi-deterministic model blend worked well as a
forecast starting point through Thursday, and this maintains good
WPC forecast continuity.  Towards the end of the forecast period,
the 12Z CMC is more progressive with the next trough moving inland
across the northwestern U.S., and the GFS/GEFS represents a good
middle ground solution for this region by next weekend.  Model
agreement is still good across the eastern U.S. with the deep
trough rather slow to move out of the region, although the GFS
becomes more amplified than the model consensus by late Saturday
into next Sunday across the Southeast U.S.  The previous
discussion follows below. /Hamrick
-----------------------

...Overview...

Guidance continues to agree upon the transition of the upper level
pattern to an amplified and slowly evolving regime consisting of a
trough drifting over the central-eastern U.S. (containing a
northern Plains into Great Lakes low) and ridge building over the
West.  An upstream Pacific trough should reach the West Coast by
around next Saturday, pushing the ridge axis into the northern
Plains through southern Rockies.  Ahead of the amplifying upper
trough, southern tier convection producing some heavy rainfall
expected to be already in progress at the start of the period
early Tuesday should extend through the Southeast and vicinity
Tuesday-Tuesday night, helped along by a Lower Mississippi Valley
through Mid-Atlantic surface wave.  The system more directly
associated with the upper trough will also produce precipitation
across the eastern half of the country mid-late week with
potential for some areas of enhanced totals.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another period of unseasonably
warm temperatures that should peak around Thursday-Friday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part the models and ensembles remain in good
agreement for the overall evolution of the amplified
central-eastern U.S. upper trough and associated surface
evolution, with fairly typical scattering of individual solutions.
 Reviewing runs through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/GEFS continued
their recent tendency to be a little on the southern/southeastern
side of the full spread for the portion of the upper low track
over the northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley and then a bit
faster with northeastward progression of the surface reflection
over the East.  Preference remained with an intermediate approach
fairly close to continuity.  The new 00Z GFS offers favorable
trends in both regards.  By days 6-7 Friday-Saturday, the details
within the core of the upper trough become more ambiguous as
solutions vary with where the initial upper low may track and
whether separate energy could yield another low center.  Meanwhile
the Tuesday-Wednesday wave tracking from the Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic displays typical scatter but good
continuity for the overall consensus.

Guidance has been showing some difficulty in resolving the details
of Pacific flow pushing into the western ridge late in the period,
as demonstrated by a widening ensemble spread over the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. by Friday-Saturday.  Through the 12Z/18Z
cycles, the ensemble means and 12Z ECMWF represented the majority
scenario of keeping the western ridge fairly strong into Friday
while a Pacific trough reaches near the West Coast around early
Saturday.  The 18Z GFS was somewhat slower while the past couple
CMC runs have been somewhat fast/amplified with the trough.  The
new 00Z GFS has adjusted closer to the means/12Z ECMWF.

Model/ensemble comparisons and continuity led to favoring an
operational model blend during the first half of the period and
then a transition to a model/mean mix with the increase of detail
uncertainty.  This yielded a 60-70 percent tilt toward the ECMWF
cluster where differences existed and the new 00Z GFS adds support
for leaning away from some specifics of earlier GFS cycles.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A leading central-eastern U.S. shortwave and Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic surface low will help to focus areas
of heavy rainfall over the Southeast and vicinity Tuesday into
Tuesday night, extending an event that should initiate farther
westward in the short-range time frame.  The deep upper low
tracking over the northern Plains and Great Lakes will support a
corresponding surface low while leading height falls will bring a
front to the East Coast, with a triple point wave possibly
becoming the dominant surface feature by the end of the week.
Over the course of the period these features may produce some
areas of heavy precipitation over the northern and eastern U.S.
but with uncertainty over specifics at this time.  Regions of
potential interest include parts of the Midwest to Lake Superior
with the parent system, portions of the Northeast where a coastal
wave could focus moisture, and locations farther south along the
trailing cold front.  Check the Storm Prediction Center's latest
outlooks for more information regarding severe threats across the
southern tier.  Extreme northern areas from the Upper Midwest into
interior New England may see some precipitation fall in the form
of snow.  Over the West, the strong jet initially crossing the
region should produce some light to moderate rain/high elevation
snow during Tuesday.  Then expect most of the region to be dry
until late in the week when light precipitation may reach the
Northwest ahead of an approaching upper trough.

Expect the Southwest to see highs up to 10-15F above normal
through the period.  The upper ridge building into the West will
expand coverage of above normal temperatures mid-late week,
followed by some moderation on Saturday as the Pacific trough
arrives.  Much of California should see highs at least 10F above
normal Wednesday and greatest anomalies (plus 10-20F and locally
higher) will likely extend from California and southern Oregon
into the Great Basin Thursday-Friday.  Some daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible late in the week.  Meanwhile cool
air under the amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to
5-15F below normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday, the
central U.S. Wednesday-Thursday, and eastern states by
Friday-Saturday. Flow ahead of the upper trough/surface system
will bring a couple days of above normal readings (especially for
morning lows) to the East around Wednesday-Thursday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 02 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Storm system to spread heavy rain and severe thunderstorms
across Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley beginning
Sunday evening...

...Unsettled weather begins moving into the Pacific Northwest
later on Sunday followed by heavy precipitation and windy
conditions on Monday...

...Critical Fire Weather Risk over the Northern/Central Plains on
Sunday...

There's a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for much of central
Florida tonight. Shortwave energy responsible for the heavy rain
and thunderstorms across central Florida yesterday and today will
depart on Sunday morning. A quasi-stationary front will linger in
its aftermath leading to scattered to isolated thunderstorm
activity across the central/southern Florida peninsula. A weak
surface low pressure system will sweep through the Ohio Valley and
Northeast tonight and tomorrow. This system will produce light
rain and snow showers across the Great Lakes and Northeast through
Sunday afternoon.

A new system will emerge from the Rockies by Sunday afternoon and
begin spreading scattered to isolated thunderstorms across the
Southern Plains. Thunderstorms may turn severe over portions of
eastern Texas through central Mississippi by Monday evening. Also,
heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding may develop over parts of
central Oklahoma, northeastern Texas, southern Arkansas, northern
Louisiana and western Mississippi. Heavy rain and thunderstorms
will spread into the Southeast on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, a potent low pressure system will arrive over the
Pacific Northwest on Sunday morning. This system will dump heavy
snow over the northern Cascades before expanding into the southern
Cascades and Northern Rockies on Monday. This system will also
produce moderate to heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms across
lower elevation areas during this time. Over 4 feet of snow are
expected to fall over the northern Cascades through Monday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CDT Sun Apr 03 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN TO CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected from the central Plains to the
southern High Plains this afternoon. Early-morning surface
observations show a surface low deepening in the lee of the northern
Rockies as a compact upper-level wave ejects into the Plains. This
low is forecast to migrate across the upper MO River Valley today
with a trailing surface trough/dryline draped southward across NE,
KS, and into western OK. Fire weather concerns will increase behind
this surface boundary, as well as across parts of the southern High
Plains where dry thunderstorms are probable.

...Central Plains...
Northwesterly winds behind the surface trough/dryline are forecast
to increase to 15-25 mph from southeast WY into southern SD, NE, and
northwest KS. This downslope wind regime typically supports RH
reductions more in line with warmer/drier solutions, which show
widespread critical fire weather conditions from far southeast WY
into central NE. These solutions are supported by a handful of
early-morning obs from southeast WY, which are reporting dewpoint
values lower than depicted by most guidance. Critical conditions
appear likely, and unseasonably high ERC values will support the
fire weather threat.

...Southern High Plains...
Weak zonal flow and gradual height falls aloft will support weak lee
cyclogenesis this afternoon across east NM and west TX.
Southwesterly winds are forecast to increase to 10-20 mph in
response to the surface pressure falls. Trajectories emanating from
northern Mexico will maintain depressed dewpoints across the region
with afternoon RH values in the teens. Elevated fire weather
conditions are expected and will be most pronounced in the immediate
lee of terrain features.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry, post-frontal air mass is expected to overspread the
Mid-Atlantic in the wake of a weak cold frontal passage early this
morning. The northwesterly offshore flow will support downslope
warming/drying in the lee of the Blue Ridge mountains. RH reductions
into the 20-35% range are possible and may coincide with sustained
winds near 15%. Areas of elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, but recent rainfall should limit the overall fire weather
potential.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The observed 00Z sounding from MAF reveals a dry boundary layer
under steep lapse rates. The combination of gradual cooling aloft
with a modest influx of low-level moisture will support 100-500 J/kg
MUCAPE atop a dry, well-mixed boundary layer by late afternoon. The
inverted-V soundings, coupled with PWAT values between 0.5-0.6
inches, will support the potential for dry lightning strikes as well
as severe downburst winds with any thunderstorm that develops along
the diffuse dryline this afternoon. See the latest Day 1 convective
outlook for more details regarding the severe potential.

256 AM EDT Sun Apr 03 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 06 2022 - 12Z Sun Apr 10 2022

...Overview...

The lower 48 will see an amplified upper pattern during the
period.  During the mid to late week time frame the dominant
features will be a deep east-central U.S. trough anchored by an
Upper Midwest into Great Lakes low, and a western U.S. ridge.  The
upper low/trough and associated surface evolution will produce a
broad area of precipitation across the northern Plains and eastern
half of the country (with some pockets of locally heavy totals
possible) while the western ridge will support much above normal
temperatures, including potential for some record highs/warm lows
over California and vicinity.  By the weekend expect a Pacific
trough to move into the West, leading to a cooling trend and some
precipitation, while progression of the eastern trough to East
Coast should favor drier weather over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A blend of 12Z/18Z operational models followed by a transition to
the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean and 12Z ECMWF provided a reasonable
depiction of consensus ideas through the period along with fairly
good continuity.  The ECMWF mean was comparable to the GEFS mean
but was not available for including in the blend due to a local
data issue.  For the wave forecast to be over/near the
Mid-Atlantic early Wednesday, consensus through the 18Z cycle was
consistent with a number of previous runs but new 00Z runs
actually seem to enlarge the spread.  The new UKMET/CMC actually
show a track into the Upper Ohio Valley before the CMC develops a
separate wave that tracks offshore like the 12Z ECMWF and faster
GFS.  Upstream the guidance had stabilized/converged for the
northern tier upper low and surrounding trough, plus the triple
point coastal wave, though by late week into the weekend some
uncertainty develops over whether the upper low may open up and
how much southwestward elongation of the trough may occur.  The
00Z UKMET is quickest to open up the low, ultimately leading to a
fast progression of the Thursday-Friday coastal wave.  GFS runs
have been on the amplified side with the southwestern part of the
trough but the new 00Z run has toned down that trait somewhat.
The new 00Z ECMWF is consistent with its prior run.  For the upper
trough moving into the West by the weekend, the CMC continues to
run on the fast/deep side of the spread so it has not been
included in the forecast blend.  GFS runs have been a little
inconsistent with potential flow separation.  Overall the 18Z run
was closest to the similar and consistent GEFS/ECMWF means while
the 00Z run has adjusted faster and flatter with its northern
stream.  Detail differences among model runs and ensemble members
continue to suggest lower predictability for this overall trough
versus the ridge/trough configuration farther east.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deep-layer low tracking over the Upper Midwest into Great
Lakes, along with a leading triple point wave that may become the
primary system by the end of the week--plus the trailing cold
front--should support multiple areas of enhanced precipitation
mid-late week.  Specifics for heaviest totals are still fairly
uncertain though.  One area of focus may be for some combination
of rain and/or snow over or a little west/south of Lake Superior,
just north of the parent low's track.  Meanwhile the wave expected
to track from the Mid-Atlantic northeastward may produce some
locally moderate to heavy rainfall.  Far interior sections of New
England may see some wintry weather on the leading side of the
moisture.  More localized pockets of enhanced rainfall are
possible farther south along the trailing cold front.  The Storm
Prediction Center is monitoring potential for severe threats
across the southern tier.  Check their latest outlooks for more
information.  Expect lingering showery precipitation, possibly
including some snow from the Midwest into the Appalachians, under
the cold upper trough into Saturday.  The upper trough pushing
into the West by the weekend should bring mostly light to moderate
rain and high elevation snow into the Northwest starting Friday or
Saturday.

The upper ridge building into the West will spread a broad area of
well above normal temperatures across the region mid-late week.
Highest temperatures will likely be on Thursday-Friday when parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin could see readings
15-25F above normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will
be possible.  The upper trough arriving from the Pacific will
bring a rapid cooling trend during the weekend, with much of the
West seeing near to below normal highs by Sunday.  Farther east,
highs generally 5-15F or so below normal will progress from the
northern Plains/northern-central Rockies into the East during
Wednesday-Saturday under the deep upper trough.  Expect
temperatures to moderate noticeably by next Sunday.  Flow ahead of
the upper trough will bring a couple days of above normal readings
(especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

point coastal wave, though by late week into the weekend some
uncertainty develops over whether the upper low may open up and
how much southwestward elongation of the trough may occur.  The
00Z UKMET is quickest to open up the low, ultimately leading to a
fast progression of the Thursday-Friday coastal wave.  GFS runs
have been on the amplified side with the southwestern part of the
trough but the new 00Z run has toned down that trait somewhat.
The new 00Z ECMWF is consistent with its prior run.  For the upper
trough moving into the West by the weekend, the CMC continues to
run on the fast/deep side of the spread so it has not been
included in the forecast blend.  GFS runs have been a little
inconsistent with potential flow separation.  Overall the 18Z run
was closest to the similar and consistent GEFS/ECMWF means while
the 00Z run has adjusted faster and flatter with its northern
stream.  Detail differences among model runs and ensemble members
continue to suggest lower predictability for this overall trough
versus the ridge/trough configuration farther east.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The deep-layer low tracking over the Upper Midwest into Great
Lakes, along with a leading triple point wave that may become the
primary system by the end of the week--plus the trailing cold
front--should support multiple areas of enhanced precipitation
mid-late week.  Specifics for heaviest totals are still fairly
uncertain though.  One area of focus may be for some combination
of rain and/or snow over or a little west/south of Lake Superior,
just north of the parent low's track.  Meanwhile the wave expected
to track from the Mid-Atlantic northeastward may produce some
locally moderate to heavy rainfall.  Far interior sections of New
England may see some wintry weather on the leading side of the
moisture.  More localized pockets of enhanced rainfall are
possible farther south along the trailing cold front.  The Storm
Prediction Center is monitoring potential for severe threats
across the southern tier.  Check their latest outlooks for more
information.  Expect lingering showery precipitation, possibly
including some snow from the Midwest into the Appalachians, under
the cold upper trough into Saturday.  The upper trough pushing
into the West by the weekend should bring mostly light to moderate
rain and high elevation snow into the Northwest starting Friday or
Saturday.

The upper ridge building into the West will spread a broad area of
well above normal temperatures across the region mid-late week.
Highest temperatures will likely be on Thursday-Friday when parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin could see readings
15-25F above normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will
be possible.  The upper trough arriving from the Pacific will
bring a rapid cooling trend during the weekend, with much of the
West seeing near to below normal highs by Sunday.  Farther east,
highs generally 5-15F or so below normal will progress from the
northern Plains/northern-central Rockies into the East during
Wednesday-Saturday under the deep upper trough.  Expect
temperatures to moderate noticeably by next Sunday.  Flow ahead of
the upper trough will bring a couple days of above normal readings
(especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Sun Apr 03 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected again Monday afternoon across the
central to northern Plains, as well as across parts of southwest TX.
A strong zonal jet is forecast to nose into the Pacific Northwest
late Sunday into early Monday. This will support strong troughing in
the lee of the Canadian Rockies, which in turn will support
increasing southerly winds through the Plains. To the south,
westerly winds in the vicinity of a weak surface low will foster
areas of elevated fire weather conditions over a region with very
dry fuels.

...Central to Northern Plains...
Latest ensemble guidance shows reasonably high confidence in
sustained 15-20 mph winds from NE into the western Dakotas as the
surface low deepens through the day. Moisture return into the region
will be limited, and combined with diurnal heating, will support RH
reductions into the 20-25% range. Drier solutions hint that critical
wind/RH conditions are possible from eastern WY into far western NE
Monday afternoon, but low ensemble probabilities minimize confidence
in this potential. Fuels across much of the High Plains remain dry
with unseasonably high ERC values, and will support a fire weather
concern for locations that do not see wetting precipitation over the
next 24 hours. Elevated to critical fire weather conditions may
develop across southern and central WY as well, but latest fuel
guidance suggests fuels are not receptive across these areas.

...Southwest Texas...
The weak surface low that is forecast to develop this afternoon
across the southern High Plains is expected to meander south towards
the Rio Grande by Monday afternoon - driven primarily by broad
ascent associated with an upper-wave moving into northern Mexico.
This will support increasing westerly downslope winds from far
southwest TX and southeast NM into the Trans Pecos region and the
Big Bend region. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph coincident with
RH values in the teens appear likely. Currently dry fuels will
remain receptive to fire spread and will support elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Increasingly stormy conditions expected to impact the Pacific
Northwest to the northern High Plains for the next couple of days
as a deep low pressure system moves onshore...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat expand across the
Deep South for the next couple of days as rain/snow moves across
the northern tier...

...Critical Fire Weather Risk today over the central Plains and
southern High Plains...

A potent low pressure system will bring increasingly active
weather into the western U.S. towards the Plains through the next
couple of days.  In the mean time, a compact low pressure system
is currently organizing over the northeastern portion of the U.S.
This system is forecast to intensify as it slides relatively
quickly off the New England coast later tonight.  Some bands of
rain/snow are expected to rotate through New England today.  The
relatively fast motion of this system will limit the snowfall
amounts.  Nevertheless, some locally enhanced amounts of wet snow
is possible particularly over the higher elevations of upstate New
York into interior New England today into tonight.  Another
fast-moving low pressure wave is forecast to spread light amounts
of rain/snow across the northern Plains today before moving
through the Great Lakes on Monday.

Farther south, thunderstorm threat will be suppressed into
southern Florida for the next couple of days as a cold front
becomes nearly stationary.  Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will
begin to turn north toward the southern tier states and converge
with a cold front slowly moving through the central Plains.  This
will lead to a steady expansion of showers and thunderstorm
activities from the southern Plains into the Deep South during the
next couple of days.  The rain and storms are expected to
intensify as they reach into the Deep South later Monday into
Tuesday with the possibility of flash flooding and severe weather.

Meanwhile, a potent low pressure system is forecast to bring
increasingly storm weather across the Pacific Northwest through
the northern High Plains the next couple of days.  This system
will dump heavy snow along the Cascades before expanding into the
northern Rockies together with high winds.  Near the Pacific
Northwest coast, moderate to heavy rain and scattered
thunderstorms are expected along with strong and gusty winds
especially Monday. Over 4 feet of snow are expected to fall over
the northern Cascades through Monday.

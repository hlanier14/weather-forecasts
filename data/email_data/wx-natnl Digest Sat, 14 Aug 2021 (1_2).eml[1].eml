Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1115 AM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

Elevated highlights have been added to portions of the northern
Plains into the Upper Mississippi Valley for this afternoon. 50+ kts
of mid-level flow will overspread the region with the passing of the
upper trough. A well mixed boundary-layer is expected to develop
(given current clear skies), which will assist in transporting some
of the stronger flow aloft to the surface. Surface minimum RH will
likely fall into the 20-25 percent range by peak heating, coinciding
with 15 mph sustained westerly surface winds atop fuels that are
critically receptive to wildfire spread.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track for isolated dry
thunderstorms across portions of the Great Basin into the Pacific
Northwest, with only minor adjustments made to the isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation to account for the latest guidance. Please
see the previous forecast below for more details on the dry
thunderstorm threat.

..Squitieri.. 08/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over the Great Basin and southwest will intensify
though the day as a broad trough moves east across the northern US.
Moist monsoonal flow will continue to transport moisture northward
beneath the ridge across the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest.
Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected by early afternoon, with
the chance for isolated dry lightning strikes.

...Great Basin and Pacific Northwest...
00z regional soundings and surface obs show mid-level monsoon
moisture in place above warm and dry surface conditions across much
of northern California and southern Oregon and into northern Nevada.
As moisture advection continues beneath the strengthening ridge,
PWAT values will approach 1 inch by early afternoon. Strong heating
will initiate thunderstorms across the higher terrain by early
afternoon. Warm and dry sub-cloud layers will favor isolated dry
strikes over dry fuels, with a risk for lightning ignitions.

Farther north across the Cascades, weak onshore flow along the
western edge of the ridge will transport moisture inland across
Washington and Oregon. Very warm surface conditions and steepening
mid-level lapse rates will result in significant instability in the
higher terrain. While surface conditions will remain unfavorable for
thunderstorms, warm and unstable conditions may result in
plume-dominated fire activity through the afternoon and evening.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 13 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, mid-level low pressure is forecast to shift
eastward
from the western U.S. with a cold front shifting southward across the Great
Plains and Mississippi Valley. The flow pattern aloft is expected to become
more zonal over North America during week-2. The large-scale environment
remains favorable for multiple tropical cyclones to develop across the
Atlantic
basin during the latter half of August.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Sat-Sun, Aug 21-22.

Slight risk of heavy rain for parts of the Southeast, Sat-Mon, Aug 21-23.

Slight risk of excessive heat for New England, Sat-Sun, Aug 21-22.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin,
and northern California, Sat-Mon, Aug 21-23.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY AUGUST 16 - FRIDAY AUGUST 20:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rZVqFaKzTbaVDcnk6MFzRlwuUXrclzcp5RDTlrqCU2F4qm7CGjvfPjVNMHFkhWv2EV03GhvK$

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 21 - FRIDAY AUGUST 27: As of Aug 13, Tropical Depression
Fred is currently located near northern Cuba and is forecast to track
northwest
and potentially strengthen when it enters the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Heavy
rain associated with the remnant low of Fred is expected to end over the
eastern U.S. prior to week-2. The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) continues to
provide a favorable large-scale environment for additional tropical cyclone
(TC) development across the Atlantic basin through late August. A tropical
wave
is currently over the Main Development Region of the tropical Atlantic, and as
of 2pm EDT on Aug 13, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) states that this
system has a 80 percent chance of becoming a TC within the next five days.
Regardless of development, this tropical wave is forecast to bring heavy rain
and flooding to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico this weekend. As early
as the start of week-2 (Aug 21), this potential TC could affect the Southeast
and a slight risk of heavy rain is introduced to parts of the Southeast early
in week-2. It should be noted that model spread remains large on the strength
and track of this potential TC after it tracks west of the Lesser Antilles.
Please refer to the NHC) for the latest updates and forecasts on Fred and what
is likely to become Tropical Storm Grace.



Model guidance has trended towards a faster eastward progression of a 500-hPa
trough from the Rockies to the Mississippi Valley at the beginning of week-2.
As this trough ejects eastward, a cold front is forecast to shift east and
south, providing the focus for thunderstorms with locally heavy rain (more
than
1 inch per 24 hours). Based on a model consensus and precipitation tools, a
slight risk of heavy rain is posted from the Ohio Valley southwest to the
Lower
Mississippi Valley and Ozarks region on Aug 21 and 22.



The ensemble means depict a 500-hPa ridge rebuilding near the West Coast
leading into week-2. Therefore, a slight risk (Aug 21-24) of excessive heat is
posted for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and northern
California
where the reforecast tools depict maximum temperatures having at least a 20
percent chance of exceeding the 85th percentile of the climatological
distribution. During the early part of week-2, maximum temperatures are
expected to be near or above 90 degrees F in the Willamette Valley of Oregon
including Portland. A strong ridge aloft over southeastern Canada and an
increasingly warm, humid air mass ahead of a cold front support a slight risk
of excessive heat across New England on Aug 21 and 22. Heat index values could
be near or above 95 degrees F in the outlined slight risk area.



A 500-hPa trough is forecast to persist to the north of Alaska which promotes
near to above normal precipitation across the northern half of Mainland
Alaska.
Farther to the south, an increase in 500-hPa heights by week-2 is expected to
result in a drier pattern for southern Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and
Alaska Panhandle.

...Heavy rain associated with Tropical Storm Fred expected to
spread further inland into the Southeast early next week...

...Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven could approach Florida during
the latter half of next week...

...Pattern Overview...

An upper level trough will likely move through the Northwest
during the early part of next week before reaching the northern
Plains later next week, heralding the end of the ongoing heat wave
across the region.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to
make landfall on the eastern Gulf Coast early next week and spread
heavy rainfall inland across the Southeast U.S./southern
Appalachians into midweek.  Toward the latter half of next week,
Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven is forecast to intensify into a
tropical storm and approach Florida.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means are in very good overall agreement on
the pattern change expected across the north-central U.S. through
the beginning of the week.  Deterministic models become more
divergent toward the end of next week regarding whether a low
pressure wave will develop and intensify over the northern Plains.
 A general model compromise with increasing weights towards the
ensemble means on Days 6 and 7 yielded a solution fairly close to
continuity.  This is also true regarding the remnants of Fred
across the Southeast with the ECMWF still favor more QPF pushing
north into the southern Appalachians.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest is expected to be over by
Monday with temperatures returning to near normal levels.  Some
portions of the Northern Rockies and adjacent portions of the
northern Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal next
Tuesday into Wednesday.  High are expected to be above normal
ahead of the cold front across the northern Plains on Monday,
followed by more pleasant readings by midweek.

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. Exact locations of heaviest
rainfall depends on the eventual track of Fred, and this is
subject to additional changes in future forecasts.

Elsewhere, monsoon activity over the Desert Southwest should
increase and spread northward, again bringing a localized flash
flood risk.  Moisture should stream northward ahead of the
incoming trough into the Northwest, with a potential for moderate
to heavy rainfall emerging over parts of the northern Rockies/high
Plains on Tuesday, with organized and enhanced rainfall then
focusing along the cold front as it advances across the Northern
Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

Elevated highlights were added to terrain favoring areas with very
dry fuels across the Northwest, as modest mid-level flow pivots
around an upper anticyclone and overspreads the region
tomorrow/Saturday. Downward momentum transport of this modest
mid-level flow along the lee of the northern Cascades and within the
Snake River Plain will support 15 mph sustained westerly winds amid
15-20% RH by afternoon peak heating.

The forecast remains on track for isolated dry thunderstorms across
portions of the Great Basin tomorrow (please see the previous
forecast below for more details). Very isolated dry thunderstorms
are still expected across portions of the Pacific Northwest. While
the latest guidance consensus suggests that overall coverage will be
lacking, at least a couple dry thunderstorms are possible,
especially within proximity to the Cascades in south-central Oregon,
where fire ignitions and subsequent growth have been exceptionally
efficient. As such, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights have been
maintained across this region. In addition, guidance consensus is
also hinting at potentially greater dry thunderstorm coverage along
the Idaho/Wyoming/Montana border area tomorrow afternoon. Given
receptive fuels, an isolated dry thunderstorm delineation may be
needed for the Day 1 Outlook pending consistency of adequate storm
coverage in future guidance.

..Squitieri.. 08/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Ridging across the western US will continue to strengthen ahead of a
developing Pacific trough. Increasing moisture across the Great
Basin and Pacific Northwest will support thunderstorm chances over
dry fuels. Elsewhere across the CONUS, relatively weak flow aloft
will limit critical fire potential.

...Pacific Northwest Thunder...
Similar to the last several days, monsoon moisture advection beneath
a ridge centered over the Great Basin will support widely scattered
thunderstorm development across the higher terrain by early
afternoon. Warm temperatures and dry surface conditions will favor
dry storms with little accumulating precipitation. Favorable
buoyancy for charge separation should result in isolated dry
lightning strikes over dry fuels through the afternoon and evening.

...Great Basin Thunder...
Isolated thunderstorms will likely develop by early afternoon at the
nose of the deeper moisture across the southern Great Basin. Despite
PWAT values near 1 inch, strong northeasterly mid-level flow along
the bottom side of the building ridge will support relatively fast
storm motions, leaving little residence time for storms to produce
significant precipitation accumulations. Given the dry fuels in
place, a risk for lightning ignitions is expected with isolated,
mostly dry, thunderstorms.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri August 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 19 - 23 2021

Model solutions are in good agreement with respect to the 500-hPa circulation
pattern over North America during the 6-10 day period. A strong mid-level
ridge, predicted over the Northeast Pacific, leads to positive 500-hPa height
anomalies across parts of central and southern Alaska, extending along parts
of
the Pacific coast. A trough is predicted over the Northern Plains, along with
near to below average 500-hPa heights. A strong ridge is predicted over
eastern
Canada along with positive mid-level height anomalies across the eastern Great
Lakes and Northeast. Near to below normal 500-hPa heights across much of the
Southern Tier from the Southwest to parts of the Southeast are associated with
a mean frontal boundary and increased convective activity.

Increased onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of
Mainland
Alaska. Above-normal temperatures are favored over parts of the western CONUS,
along the eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific mid-level ridge.
Below-normal temperatures are favored for the Northern Rockies and High
Plains,
under the predicted mid-level trough. Increased moisture advection and cloud
cover enhance odds for below-normal temperatures across parts of the
Southwest.
Strong positive 500-hPa height anomalies enhance odds for above-normal
temperatures from much of the Midwest across the Great Lakes and extending
into
the Northeast, with the highest probability over 80% over parts of New
England.
Above normal temperatures are favored across parts of the Southern Plains and
Southeast region, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Above-normal precipitation is favored for north-central Mainland Alaska, ahead
of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea. Below-normal precipitation is
likely for the Aleutians and southern Mainland Alaska underneath forecast
above
normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation is likely for parts of the
northwestern CONUS ahead of the predicted ridge. A predicted trough over the
Northern Plains and frontal boundary activity increase probabilities of
above-normal precipitation across much of the central-eastern CONUS. Increased
odds of above-normal precipitation are also favored across the Southern Plains
and parts of the Great Basin due to an active Southwest Monsoon circulation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
very good model agreement on the predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern over
the
CONUS, offset by differences among model temperature and precipitation
forecasts, and uncertainty associated with the potential for tropical activity
in the Southeast.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 21 - 27 2021

Models continue to be in good agreement on the predicted circulation pattern
over North America during the week 2 period, with some de-amplification of
large-scale anomalies relative to the 6-10 day period. A trough is predicted
over the Bering Sea and western Aleutians during the week 2 period, while
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the Aleutians and central
and southern Alaska, under increased influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge.
Predicted mid-level troughing is over the western coast. Similar to the 6-10
day period, a strong mean mid-level ridge over southeastern Canada leads to
positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending across the Upper and Middle
Mississippi Valley and Northeast. Near-normal mid-level heights over the
Southern Plains and Southeast are associated with increased convective
activity
along a mean frontal boundary.

Increased onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of
Mainland
Alaska. Above normal temperatures are likely for the western Aleutians
underneath above normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favored
from parts of the western CONUS to across the intermountain region to the
Great
Plains, consistent with the reforecast tools. There is a two category change
over parts of the Southwest due a continued signal for a suppressed monsoon
and
good agreement between the reforecast tools. Enhanced probabilities of
above-normal temperatures are favored from the Mississippi Valley eastward to
the eastern CONUS, under positive mid-level height anomalies and consistent
with the reforecast tools.

Increased onshore flow over central and northern Mainland Alaska increases the
chances of above-normal precipitation. Below-normal precipitation is predicted
for southern Alaska, under the increased influence of the Northeast Pacific
ridge. Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the western CONUS and
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley consistent with the reforecast tools. A
mean frontal boundary and potential tropical activity lead to enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation across much of the Southeast and
parts of the Mid-Atlantic states. Below-normal precipitation is more likely
over parts of the Northeast underneath positive mid-level height anomalies.
Below normal precipitation is also favored over parts of southern Texas,
supported by the reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered
on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the circulation pattern over the forecast domain, offset by
increased uncertainty in the phase and amplitude of large-scale anomalies, and
some differences among the model temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Monsoonal thunderstorms expected in the Southwest through the
weekend...

...Thunderstorms likely along and ahead of a front from the
Central Plains to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic; severe weather and heavy rain possible ...

...Fred is forecast to impact much of Florida with heavy rain as
it crosses the Keys on Saturday...

...Oppressive heat continues across the Northwest, Eastern
Seaboard, and South-Central CONUS...

A busy weather pattern is in place through the weekend as multiple
features set up to the south of a slow-moving upper-level trough
stretching from central Canada into the north-central U.S. The
Southwest Monsoon remains active with showers and thunderstorms
anticipated for the next several days as monsoonal moisture
continues to flow into the region. Within the last 30 days,
portions of the Southwest have received 200-300 percent of average
rainfall and thus are vulnerable to additional heavy rain.
Accordingly, a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall and Flash Flood
Watches cover the southern half of Arizona and New Mexico through
Sunday.

Farther east, a surface cold front will propagate eastward across
the northeastern quadrant of the county, while meandering over the
Central Plains/Mississippi Valley. As moisture flows into the
front, it should provide a focus for rain and thunderstorms, with
both severe weather and flash flooding as possible threats. Today,
the greatest chances for severe weather look to be ahead of the
front in the Central High Plains, Ohio Valley, and portions of the
Mid-Atlantic with Slight Risks delineated by the Storm Prediction
Center. Similar to yesterday, scattered damaging wind is
anticipated to be the predominant severe threat, and a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch currently extends across Maryland into
Virginia.  Isolated flash floods are also possible today over a
large Marginal Risk area stretching from Oklahoma north and
eastward toward the Mid-South, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and
Mid-Atlantic. Then on Saturday, heavy rain looks to focus over
portions of the Mid-Atlantic, and especially given the wet
antecedent conditions, scattered flash floods are possible and a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place. A few severe
thunderstorms could also occur.

Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Fred is expected to skirt the north
coast of Cuba today while remaining at tropical depression
strength. Fred is anticipated to strengthen to a tropical storm
and cross the keys on Saturday before turning north into the
Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Ahead of Fred, bands of tropical
showers/thunderstorms are already underway across Florida which
could produce isolated flash flooding over South Florida including
Miami. As Fred tracks offshore the western Florida coast,
additional bands of tropical thunderstorms will occur over Florida
as deep tropical moisture streams in. Scattered flash floods are
possible over South Florida tomorrow, before the flash flood
threat expands over much of Florida and Southeast Georgia Sunday
as Fred approaches the Florida Peninsula at tropical storm
strength. Users are encouraged to follow the latest forecast
information from the National Hurricane Center, as Tropical Storm
Warnings are in effect for the Keys and areas offshore Southwest
Florida.

Heavy rain aside, the ongoing oppressive heat continues to be a
hazard during the short range period across multiple regions. The
Northwest and North Great Basin can expect continued
record-breaking heat in terms of both high minimum and maximum
temperatures through this weekend. Excessive Heat Warnings and a
few Heat Advisories cover much of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Great Basin as temperatures soar into the 100s in the
Pacific Northwest and the Northern Great Basin. The heat is
forecast to lessen somewhat at least in the Seattle and Portland
areas by Sunday, but the interior will remain hot, and above
normal temperatures are expected to spread toward the Northern
Plains to begin next week. In addition to the heat, Air Quality
Alerts are in place for the Northwest and into parts of the
Rockies given smoke from fires and high ozone levels.
Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms remain a threat through
Sunday as well, which could worsen the ongoing fire situation in
the West. In the East, another day of high humidity and hot
temperatures creating high heat indices well over 100F is
expected, and Heat Advisories are in effect from North Carolina to
Maine and also into portions of West Virginia, with Excessive Heat
Warnings embedded in the northern Mid-Atlantic. By Sunday, the
cooler air behind the passing cold front will break the hot streak
and cool temperatures off to around seasonal.

...Heavy rain associated with Tropical Storm Fred expected to
spread further inland into the Southeast early next week...

...Potential Tropical Cyclone Seven could approach Florida during
the latter half of next week...

...Pattern Overview...

An upper level trough will likely move through the Northwest
during the early part of next week before reaching the northern
Plains later next week, heralding the end of the ongoing heat wave
across the region.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred is forecast to
make landfall on the eastern Gulf Coast early next week and spread
heavy rainfall inland across the Southeast U.S. into the southern
Appalachians.  Toward the latter half of next week, Potential
Tropical Cyclone Seven is forecast to intensify into a tropical
storm and approach Florida.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means are in very good overall agreement on
the pattern change expected across the north-central U.S. through
the beginning of the week.  However, deterministic models have
become more divergent toward the end of next week regarding
whether a low pressure wave will develop and intensify over the
northern Plains.  A general model compromise with increasing
weights towards the ensemble means on Days 6 and 7 yielded a
solution fairly close to continuity.  This is also true regarding
the remnants of Fred across the Southeast with the ECMWF still
favors more QPF pushing north into the southern Appalachians.  In
contrast, the GFS/GEFS continues to advertise much less QPF across
the Southeast given a much weaker remnant circulation of Fred in
the forecasts.  An intermediate solution was adapted as a
compromise given past performances of these two models on tropical
systems.

The WPC medium-range package was based on a blend of the 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, and some contributions from the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean with more weights from the ensemble means for Days 6
and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest is expected to be over by
Monday with temperatures returning to near normal levels.  Some
portions of the Northern Rockies and adjacent portions of the
northern Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal next
Tuesday into Wednesday.  High are expected to be above normal
ahead of the cold front across the northern Plains on Monday,
followed by more pleasant readings by midweek.

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. Exact locations of heaviest
rainfall depends on the eventual track of Fred, and this is
subject to additional changes in future forecasts.

Elsewhere, monsoon activity over the Desert Southwest should
increase and spread northward, again bringing a localized flash
flood risk.  Moisture should stream northward ahead of the
incoming trough into the Northwest, with a potential for moderate
to heavy rainfall emerging over parts of the northern Rockies/high
Plains on Tuesday, with organized and enhanced rainfall then
focusing along the cold front as it advances across the Northern
Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.  Toward the latter half of next
week, attention may once again be drawn to Florida where Potential
Tropical Cyclone Seven over the tropical Atlantic is forecast to
intensify into a tropical storm before approaching the Sunshine
State.

...Amended for the latest forecast track of Tropical Depression
Fred...

A busy weather pattern is in place through the weekend as multiple
features set up to the south of a slow-moving upper-level trough
stretching from Central Canada into the North-Central U.S. The
Southwest Monsoon remains active with showers and thunderstorms
anticipated for the next several days as monsoonal moisture
continues to flow into the region. Within the last 30 days,
portions of the Southwest have received 200-300 percent of average
rainfall and thus are vulnerable to additional heavy rain.
Accordingly, a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall and Flash Flood
Watches cover the southern half of Arizona and New Mexico through
Sunday.

Farther east, a surface cold front will propagate eastward across
the northeastern quadrant of the county, while meandering over the
Central Plains/Mississippi Valley. As moisture flows into the
front, it should provide a focus for rain and thunderstorms, with
both severe weather and flash flooding as possible threats. Today,
the greatest chances for severe weather look to be ahead of the
front in the Central High Plains, Ohio Valley, and portions of the
Mid-Atlantic with Slight Risks delineated by the Storm Prediction
Center. Similar to yesterday, scattered damaging wind is
anticipated to be the predominant severe threat, and a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch currently extends across Maryland into
Virginia.  Isolated flash floods are also possible today over a
large Marginal Risk area stretching from Oklahoma north and
eastward toward the Mid-South, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and
Mid-Atlantic. Then on Saturday, heavy rain looks to focus over
portions of the Mid-Atlantic, and especially given the wet
antecedent conditions, scattered flash floods are possible and a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place. A few severe
thunderstorms could also occur.

Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Fred is expected to move across
Cuba today while remaining at tropical depression strength. Fred
is anticipated to strengthen to a tropical storm and move just
west of the Keys on Saturday before turning north into the eastern
Gulf of Mexico. Ahead of Fred, bands of tropical
showers/thunderstorms are already underway across Florida which
could produce isolated flash flooding over South Florida including
Miami. As Fred tracks west of the Florida coastline, additional
bands of tropical thunderstorms will occur over Florida as deep
tropical moisture streams in. Scattered flash floods are possible
over South Florida tomorrow, before the flash flood threat expands
over much of Florida and Southeast Georgia Sunday as Fred
approaches the Florida Peninsula at tropical storm strength. Users
are encouraged to follow the latest forecast information from the
National Hurricane Center, as Tropical Storm Warnings are in
effect for the Florida Keys and areas offshore Southwest Florida.

Heavy rain aside, the ongoing oppressive heat continues to be a
hazard during the short range period across multiple regions. The
Northwest and North Great Basin can expect continued
record-breaking heat in terms of both high minimum and maximum
temperatures through this weekend. Excessive Heat Warnings and a
few Heat Advisories cover much of the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Great Basin as temperatures soar into the 100s in the
Pacific Northwest and the Northern Great Basin. The heat is
forecast to lessen somewhat at least in the Seattle and Portland
areas by Sunday, but the interior will remain hot, and above
normal temperatures are expected to spread toward the Northern
Plains to begin next week. In addition to the heat, Air Quality
Alerts are in place for the Northwest and into parts of the
Rockies given smoke from fires and high ozone levels.
Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms remain a threat through
Sunday as well, which could worsen the ongoing fire situation in
the West. In the East, another day of high humidity and hot
temperatures creating high heat indices well over 100F is
expected, and Heat Advisories are in effect from North Carolina to
Maine and also into portions of West Virginia, with Excessive Heat
Warnings embedded in the northern Mid-Atlantic. By Sunday, the
cooler air behind the passing cold front will break the hot streak
and cool temperatures off to around seasonal.

...Heavy rain associated with Tropical Depression Fred expected to
spread further inland into the Southeast early next week...

...Tropical Depression Seven could approach Florida during the
latter half of next week...

...Pattern Overview...

Upper level troughing is forecast to move through the Pacific
Northwest early next week then advance toward the northern Plains
and western Great Lakes later next week, bringing some relief from
the high heat and humidity to portions of the northern tier.
Meanwhile, focus is on Tropical Depression Fred which is forecast
to make landfall as a tropical storm early next week across the
central Gulf Coast and then spread its heavy rainfall inland
toward the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. Finally, toward the latter
half of next week, attention turns to Tropical Depression Seven
which may intensify into a tropical storm and approach southern
Florida, though there remains considerable uncertainty with that
system's track and intensity forecast.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The deterministic and ensemble guidance overall is in reasonably
good agreement for the synoptic pattern for the medium range
period. For the troughing advancing through the Northwest,
northern Rockies, and northern Plains, the main model outlier that
was not considered was the 18Z GFS which cuts off the upper level
energy over the central/northern Rockies while the rest of the
deterministic guidance and ensemble support maintains a
progressive wave through the western Great Lakes. With this upper
level troughing pushing through, surface low pressure is forecast
to develop over the Plains and lift toward the Great Lakes in the
latter portions of the period. Some of the typical timing biases
show up in the deterministic models so the blend leaned on the
ECENS/GEFS means to help mitigate those biases and provide some
continuity from the previous forecast. Regarding the southern U.S.
and tropical features, a ECMWF/GFS blend was favored for Fred as a
good proxy for the official NHC track through there remains some
spread in the track guidance as the system enters the
central/eastern Gulf. For Tropical Depression Seven, there remains
considerable uncertainty in the strength and intensity forecast
for days 5-7. Overall, the WPC medium-range package was based on a
blend of the 12 ECMWF/ECENS mean, 12Z GFS/GEFS mean, and some
contribution from the 12Z CMC with more weights from the ensemble
means for Days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. There remains some uncertainty
in the heaviest rainfall axis however across the southern
Appalachians, Deep South, and TN/OH Valleys as some westward
trends in the track as well as intensity issues could affect the
potential rainfall impacts. For Tropical Depression Seven, while
there is much above normal uncertainty in the track/intensity
forecast, the system may approach portions of southern Florida
late next week. Follow the advisories from the NHC on both of
these systems for the latest forecast information.

Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture activity over the Desert Southwest
is expected to increase, again bringing a localized flash flood
risk.  Moisture should stream northward ahead of the incoming
trough into the Northwest, with a potential for moderate to heavy
rainfall emerging over parts of the northern Rockies/high Plains
on Tuesday, with organized and enhanced rainfall then focusing
along the cold front as it advances across the Northern Plains
Tuesday into Wednesday.  Toward the latter half of next week,
attention may once again be drawn to southern Florida where
Tropical Depression Seven is forecast to intensify into a tropical
storm before approaching the Sunshine State, though there remains
some considerable uncertainty in the eventual track/intensity of
that system.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0230 AM CDT Sat Aug 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
A large mid-level anticyclone will remain entrenched across the West
on Saturday as a broad trough moves across the Great Lakes. The flow
around the anticyclone will continue to transport mid-level moisture
northward around its periphery, bringing with it a continued chance
of isolated dry thunderstorms.

... Dry Thunderstorm Areas -- Northern California, Nevada, Idaho,
and Montana ...

Mid-level flow around a large anticyclone centered over the Great
Basin will circulate moisture through the West. Intense diurnal
heating and terrain-induced circulations will combine with this
moisture to support the development of isolated thunderstorms. Warm
temperatures and dry surface conditions will support dry
thunderstorms with little to no accumulating precipitation.

Precipitable water values may be sufficiently high across portions
of Nevada to support a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms. However,
modest northeast flow in the mid-levels may support sufficiently
fast storm motions to limit accumulating precipitation at any one
area.

... Wind/RH Areas -- Central Washington and Southern Idaho ...

Mid-level winds will strengthen during the day in advance of an
approaching mid-level speed maximum lifting northward on the western
periphery of the large anticyclone. Vigorous vertical mixing
stemming from the hot and dry boundary layer will support the
downward momentum transfer of this strengthening flow. The result
will be gusty afternoon winds in the lee of the Cascades and the
Snake River Plain. With relative humidity values in the teens, the
result will be elevated to locally critical fire-weather concerns.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The large western United States anticyclone will persist through the
day on Sunday before beginning to weaken and break down late Sunday
into Monday as a short-wave trough impinges upon the anticyclone.
Farther east, a weak mid-level tough/cyclonic wind shift will move
south through the Plains on the eastern side of the anticyclone.

... Central and Eastern Washington and Western Montana ...

Mid-level heights will flatten on Sunday across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies as a short-wave trough moves atop the
ridge. Strengthening westerly downsloping winds will result in
relative humidity falling into the low-to-mid teens and winds
gusting in excess of 25-30 miles per hour across portions of
Montana. The result will be critical fire conditions for a few hours
during the afternoon in the plains east of the northern Rockies of
Montana. Surrounding the critical conditions elevated to locally
critical conditions will be possible.

Across central and eastern Washington, relative humidity will be
lower than across Montana, but more uncertainty to the strength and
duration of the winds during the afternoon will preclude the
introduction of critical conditions at this time. This will be
revisited in subsequent forecasts.

... Northern California into Eastern Oregon ...

Another day of terrain-circulation-induced thunderstorms will once
again be possible as the hot, dry boundary layer interacts with
modest mid-level moisture to produce enough instability to support
charge separation. Additionally, increasingly westerly flow in the
cloud-bearing layer may support faster storm motions than in
previous days, contributing to the lack of wetting rains from any
thunderstorm that does develop.

...Monsoonal thunderstorms could cause scattered flash flooding in
the Southwest through the weekend...

...Thunderstorms likely along and ahead of a front from the Plains
to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic, with strong storms
and flash flooding possible ...

...Fred is forecast to impact much of Florida with heavy rain as
it moves just west of the Keys today...

...Oppressive heat continues particularly across the western U.S.
with one more warm day along the Eastern Seaboard as well...

A busy weather pattern is in place through the weekend as multiple
features set up to the south of a typical summer jet stream
focused along the northern U.S. and Canada. One area of concern is
the Southwest, as showers and thunderstorms are once again
forecast as above normal monsoonal moisture continues to flow into
the region. A wet monsoon season has meant much of the Southwest
has seen 200-300 percent of its average rainfall and thus is
vulnerable to additional heavy rain. Accordingly, Flash Flood
Watches cover the southern half of Arizona, parts of New Mexico,
and Far West Texas through Sunday, with a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall also in place today.

Farther east, a surface cold front will propagate eastward across
the northeastern quadrant of the county today, while meandering
over the Plains and Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys through Monday.
As moisture flows into the front, it should provide a focus for
rain and thunderstorms, with flash flooding and possibly severe
weather as threats. Isolated flash floods are possible across much
of the south-central and southeastern U.S. through Monday, with
broad Marginal Risk areas outlooked for excessive rainfall. Today
into tonight, rainfall totals could be enhanced over portions of
the Mid-Atlantic, and especially given the wet antecedent
conditions, scattered flash floods are possible and a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall is in place. Some strong to severe storms
also could occur in a few areas along the frontal system today
where the Storm Prediction Center has Marginal Risk areas in
place--the Central High Plains, the Mid-Atlantic, and New England.

Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Fred is currently expected to move
west-northwest and pass near or west of the lower Florida Keys
later today, move into the eastern Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, and
move inland over the Florida Panhandle on Monday. Slow
strengthening of the system is forecast, and Fred could once again
become a tropical storm before landfall. Users are encouraged to
follow the latest forecast information from the National Hurricane
Center, as Tropical Storm Warnings are in effect for the Florida
Keys and areas offshore Southwest Florida. While gusty winds are a
threat with Fred, additionally, heavy tropical downpours could
cause scattered flash flooding over much of Florida through the
weekend associated with the system. A Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is in place for southern Florida through the weekend,
while portions of the Florida Panhandle are added to the Slight
Risk Sunday as Fred approaches.

Heavy rain aside, the ongoing oppressive heat continues to be a
hazard during the short range period, especially across the West.
Excessive Heat Warnings and some Heat Advisories cover much of the
Pacific Northwest, the Great Basin, and California as temperatures
soar into the 100s. This heat could be record-breaking once again
in terms of both high minimum and maximum temperatures. The heat
is forecast to lessen somewhat at least in the Seattle and
Portland areas by Sunday, but the interior will remain hot, and
above normal temperatures are expected to spread toward the
Northern Plains to begin next week. In addition to the heat, Air
Quality Alerts are in place for the Northwest and into parts of
the Rockies given smoke from fires and high ozone levels.
Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms and Elevated to Critical
fire conditions remain a threat through at least Sunday as well,
which could worsen the ongoing fire situation in the West.
Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to be warmer than normal
today across the Eastern Seaboard ahead of the cold front, and
warm minimum daily records could be set this morning with high
heat indices once again this afternoon. However, by Sunday,
temperatures should be near to below normal behind the cold
frontal passage.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1106 AM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm area is introduced to northern AZ.
Thunderstorms are more probable further south across central AZ
where orographic ascent and instability will be maximized, but this
region lies on the northern periphery of deeper monsoonal moisture
(per GOES PWAT imagery and morning soundings) that will support a
dry lightning threat if storms can develop. While thunderstorms
across central AZ will likely see wetting rainfall, gusty outflow
winds are expected and may impact ongoing fires in the region.
Additionally, some guidance indicates that the thermodynamic
environment over central NV will be favorable for dry thunderstorms,
but confidence in the occurrence of storms remains low due to a lack
of sufficient forcing for ascent.

All other areas remain on track with only minor adjustments made
based on morning observations and recent ensemble guidance trends.
See the previous discussion below for details regarding the other
fire weather concerns.

..Moore.. 07/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge across the Four Corners will continue to
retrograde westward and intensify within the intermountain region
today. A belt of stronger mid-level winds will exist across the
Northwest. At the surface, high pressure off the West Coast will
combine with deepening thermal pressure troughs within the
California Central Valley northward into the Columbia Basin to
produce dry and breezy conditions. High pressure in the northern
Rockies will drive breezy north winds into parts of the eastern
Great Basin.

...Utah/southwestern Colorado...
Dry and windy north winds will reach 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
A few stronger gusts may occur as modestly enhanced mid-level winds
on the eastern flank of the upper-ridge will be present. RH could
fall as low as the single digits, though 5-15% will be more common.

...Columbia Basin...
Winds will be locally enhanced within the Columbia gaps as a surface
trough deepens in the Basin in response to strong heating. Winds of
15-20 mph are most likely, though 20-25 could briefly occur. The
overlap of these locally stronger winds with dry conditions will not
be substantial. However, 15-25% is likely from the terrain to the
immediately adjacent plains.

...San Joaquin Valley...
High pressure off the West Coast will combine with strong heating in
the Valley to drive 15-20 mph winds within a small portion of the
region. With RH of 15-20% during the afternoon, areas of elevated
fire weather risk may develop.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
While uncertainty exists with regard to storm initiation and
coverage due to an intensifying upper ridge, some potential exists
for lighting to occur in parts of the Sierra as well as into
southern Nevada. Storm motions will be slow and PWAT will be on the
high side which further precludes highlights.

...Western Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Ongoing Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat to Refire Midweek...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Another significant heat wave now underway over the West under
upper ridging will continue from the Great Basin to CA and the
Southwest into early-mid next week with temperatures 10-15F above
normal. Several daily temperature records are likely into
Tuesday/Wednesday. Guidance consensus is leading to gradually
lowering heights with a developing modest northwest US trough,
with the highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ. There
is potential for rebuilding heights over the Northwest as a closed
low develops off the west coast of Canada next Fri-Sat 17 July.
Above normal temperatures are expected across much of the Great
Basin and northern Rockies/High Plains next Fri 16 July- Sat 17
July. Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into
the Southeast may also support above normal temperatures next week
from the Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the
Northeast. This includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies next week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
However, this could also lead to additional local downpour and
terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is a persistent signal for a multi-day stretch of episodes
of heavy rainfall now in progress over the Midwest, with renewed
episodes expected Wednesday-Friday as instability and upwards of
1.75" precipitable water values pool ahead of a wavy front. The
models have renewed rainfall maxima gradually shifting from the
Upper Midwest by midweek to adjacent portions of the Mid-MS/OH
Valleys late week with slow frontal progression. This offers

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty remains below
normal next week with exception of shortwaves progressing through
a mean Midwest trough and with late period eastern Pacific system
specifics. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of best clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET and ECMWF ensembles along with the 13
UTC National Blend of Models. The composite maintains good WPC
continuity and acts to mitigate smaller scale guidance differences
consistent with predictability. The latest 12 UTC guidance
composite also remains consistent.

...Western Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Ongoing Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat to Refire Midweek...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Another significant heat wave now underway over the West under
upper ridging will continue from the Great Basin to CA and the
Southwest into early-mid next week with temperatures 10-15F above
normal. Several daily temperature records are likely into
Tuesday/Wednesday. Guidance consensus is leading to gradually
lowering heights with a developing modest northwest US trough,
with the highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ. There
is potential for rebuilding heights over the Northwest as a closed
low develops off the west coast of Canada next Fri-Sat 17 July.
Above normal temperatures are expected across much of the Great
Basin and northern Rockies/High Plains next Fri 16 July- Sat 17
July. Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into
the Southeast may also support above normal temperatures next week
from the Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the
Northeast. This includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies next week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
However, this could also lead to additional local downpour and
terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is a persistent signal for a multi-day stretch of episodes
of heavy rainfall now in progress over the Midwest, with renewed
episodes expected Wednesday-Friday as instability and upwards of
1.75" precipitable water values pool ahead of a wavy front. The
models have renewed rainfall maxima gradually shifting from the
Upper Midwest by midweek to adjacent portions of the Mid-MS/OH
Valleys late week with slow frontal progression. This offers
excessive rainfall and resultant flooding threats.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty remains below
normal next week with exception of shortwaves progressing through
a mean Midwest trough and with late period eastern Pacific system
specifics. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0138 PM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm risk area has been introduced for parts
of south-central NV. Monsoonal moisture will continue northward over
the next 24-48 hours, which will help augment instability to around
100-250 J/kg MUCAPE. During the late afternoon and early evening
hours, lift ahead of a weak mid-level impulse will overspread the
region. While storm coverage is uncertain away from the higher
terrain of the Sierra, storms that do form will most likely be dry
given a deep, dry boundary layer. All other areas remain on track
with only minor adjustments needed based on recent trends in
guidance (see the discussion below for details).

..Moore.. 07/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0208 AM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will remain across the Great Basin into parts of
the Southwest on Sunday. A shortwave trough will be favorably timed
with afternoon heating across parts of western Montana. At the
surface, the primary feature of interest will be thermal pressure
troughs within the intermountain region in response to strong
surface heating.

...Northern Nevada and southern Idaho...
Along with modest surface pressure gradient support, mid-level winds
will be enhanced on the northern flank of the upper-ridge. This will
especially be the case when the shortwave trough passes to the north
during the afternoon. This will lead to enhanced Zephyr winds in
northern portions of Nevada along with stronger winds in the Snake
River Plain. Winds will generally stay between 15-20 mph with RH
falling to 10-20%.

...Southwest Montana...
With the well-timed shortwave, thunderstorm development appears
probable in southwestern Montana during the afternoon. Relatively
fast storm motions and dry low levels will promote a risk for
isolated dry thunderstorms and an associated risk for lightning
ignitions in the present dry fuels.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat July 10 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Flooding possible for portions of the central and eastern
U.S....

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. this weekend...

...Strong to severe storms forecast for the Plains...

At the start of the short-term forecast period, a cold front
extended from the Canadian Maritimes to the southwest just off the
Eastern Seaboard with a stationary front extending west through
the Carolinas, Ohio Valley, and to a low pressure center currently
in place over the Middle Mississippi Valley. A cold front extended
to the southwest over the Central and Southern Plains. Widespread
showers and thunderstorms are forecast along and ahead of the
associated frontal boundaries and the low pressure system moves
slowly to the northeast towards the Great Lakes over the next
couple of days. High boundary layer moisture is in place across
the region, with dewpoints in the low to mid-70s. A Moderate Risk
for excessive rainfall is in effect through Sunday morning for
portions of the Lower Ohio Valley and Middle Mississippi Valley,
with heavy rain rates of 1-2 inches per hour possible with
thunderstorms that may train along the stationary front leading to
the risk for flash flooding. Multiple Slight Risks for excessive
rainfall are also in place for Sunday and Monday along both the
cold front that will progress southeast through the Lower
Mississippi Valley and east along the stationary front that will
begin to lift north as a warm front. The areas with the greatest
flash flood risk are along the cold front moving across the Lower
Mississippi Valley and into the Southeast where isolated totals of
4-6 inches are possible Sunday and up to 4 inches on Monday as
mean southwesterly flow oriented along the cold front may lead to
multiple rounds of storms for some locations. There is also an
isolated risk for heavy rain amounts up to 5 inches for southern
New Hampshire on Monday. In addition to the flash flood risk,
severe storms are also possible ahead of the cold front moving
southward through the Central and Southern Plains. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk for severe
thunderstorms today extending from southwest Missouri into
northeastern Oklahoma for the threat of large hail and high winds.
A Slight Risk is also in effect tomorrow from the Lower
Mississippi Valley west through north Texas for the continued risk
of high winds with thunderstorms forming along the cold front.

The oppressive heat wave continues across the western U.S. as an
upper-level ridge remains in place. Potential all-time record heat
is forecast in some places, including Las Vegas, where the
all-time record high of 117 may be reached today. Widespread high
temperatures of 110 and above are forecast for the Southwest
deserts as well as the central California valleys. Highs in the
100s are likely across the Great Basin and into the upper 90s for
the interior Pacific Northwest. Excessive heat warnings cover most
of California and Nevada as well as portions of western Arizona,
western Utah, and the Snake River Valley of Idaho. High
temperatures into the 100s are also forecast for the High Plains
of Montana, where excessive heat watches are in effect. A cold
front moving south from Canada will provide relief for Montana on
Monday, while a shortwave trough moving east from the Pacific may
also provide some relief for portions of northern California. In
addition to the heat wave, heavy rain and severe weather are a
growing concern for portions of southern Arizona and New Mexico as
monsoonal moisture contributes to daily rounds of showers and
thunderstorms. Marginal Risks for excessive rainfall are in effect
today, tomorrow, and Sunday as the more intense downpours pose the
risk of flash flooding with 2" per hour rain rates possible. The
Storm Prediction Center has also issued Slight Risks for Severe
weather for today and Sunday for the threat of downbursts with
high winds.

Elsewhere, seasonably mild temperatures are expected through the
period across most of the Northeast behind the cold front that has
moved into the Atlantic, and also for the Midwest and Central
Plains in the wake of the cold front moving south and east across
the central U.S. The chance for showers and thunderstorms will
continue to pick up across more of the Southwest and Southern
Great Basin Monday as monsoonal moisture continues to increase and
the upper-level ridge begins to weaken. Showers and thunderstorms
are also possible for the Northern Plains along the noted cold
front moving south from Canada.

northeast towards the Great Lakes over the next couple of days.
High boundary layer moisture is in place across the region, with
dewpoints in the low to mid-70s. A Moderate Risk for excessive
rainfall is in effect through Sunday morning for portions of the
Lower Ohio Valley and Middle Mississippi Valley, with rain rates
of 1-2 inches per hour possible with thunderstorms that may train
along the stationary front, leading to the risk for flash
flooding. Multiple Slight Risks for excessive rainfall are also in
place for Sunday and Monday along both the cold front that will
progress southeast through the Lower Mississippi Valley and east
along the stationary front that will begin to lift north as a warm
front. The areas with the greatest flash flood risk are along the
cold front moving across the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Southeast where isolated totals of 4-6 inches are possible Sunday
and up to 4 inches on Monday as mean southwesterly flow roughly
oriented along the cold front may lead to multiple rounds of
storms for some locations. There is also an isolated risk for rain
amounts of up to 5 inches for southern New Hampshire on Monday. In
addition to the flash flood risk, severe storms are also possible
ahead of the cold front moving southward through the Central and
Southern Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an
Enhanced Risk for severe thunderstorms today extending from
southwest Missouri into northeastern Oklahoma for the threat of
large hail and high winds. A Slight Risk is also in effect
tomorrow from the Lower Mississippi Valley west through north
Texas for the continued risk of high winds with thunderstorms
forming along the cold front.

The oppressive heat wave continues across the western U.S. as an
upper-level ridge remains in place. Potential all-time record heat
is forecast in some places, including Las Vegas, where the
all-time record high of 117 may be reached today. Widespread high
temperatures of 110 and above are forecast for the Southwest
deserts as well as the central California valleys. Highs in the
100s are likely across the Great Basin and into the upper 90s for
the interior Pacific Northwest. Excessive heat warnings cover most
of California and Nevada as well as portions of western Arizona,
western Utah, and the Snake River Valley of Idaho. High
temperatures into the 100s are also forecast for the High Plains
of Montana on Sunday, where excessive heat watches are in effect.
A cold front moving south from Canada will provide relief for
Montana on Monday, while a shortwave trough moving east from the
Pacific may also provide some relief for portions of northern
California. In addition to the heat wave, heavy rain and severe
weather are a growing concern for portions of southern Arizona and
New Mexico as monsoonal moisture contributes to daily rounds of
showers and thunderstorms. Marginal Risks for excessive rainfall
are in effect today, tomorrow, and Monday as the more intense
downpours pose the risk of flash flooding with 2 inches per hour
rain rates possible. The Storm Prediction Center has also issued
Slight Risks for severe weather for today and Sunday for the
threat of downbursts with high winds.

Elsewhere, seasonably mild temperatures are expected through the
period across most of the Northeast behind the cold front that has
moved into the Atlantic, as well as for the Midwest and Central
Plains in the wake of the cold front moving south and east across
the central U.S. The chance for showers and thunderstorms will
continue to pick up across more of the Southwest and Southern
Great Basin Monday as monsoonal moisture continues to increase and
the upper-level ridge begins to weaken. Showers and thunderstorms
are also possible for the Northern Plains along the noted cold
front moving south from Canada.

...Western Heat Persists Thru Next Week and Spreads into the
Northern Plains...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat to Redevelop Midweek...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Another significant heat wave now underway over the West under
upper ridging will continue from the Great Basin to CA and the
Southwest into early-mid next week with temperatures 10-15F above
normal. Several daily temperature records are likely into
Tuesday/Wednesday. Guidance consensus is leading to gradually
lowering heights with a developing modest northwest US trough,
with the highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ. There
is potential for rebuilding heights over the Great Basin to the
central Rockies and northern Plains as a closed low persists off
the west coast of Canada next weekend. Above normal temperatures
are expected across much of the northern Great Basin and northern
Rockies/High Plains next Fri 16 July- Sun 18 July, with cluster of
high temperatures reaching 10-15 degrees above normal next
weekend.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may also support above normal temperatures next week
from the Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the
Northeast. This includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York City corridor. Over next weekend, the
upper trough drifts east from the Lakes into the northeast,
driving a cold front across the region. This increases
shower/storm chances with the front, followed by post-frontal
cooling in the lower Lakes and then next Sunday 18 July into the
adjacent northern mid Atlantic.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies next week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
However, this could also lead to additional local downpour and
terrain enhancing runoff issues.

With a wave front in the Midwest to the central Plains, additional
rounds of heavy showers and storms are forecast near the
meandering front, instability and upwards of 1.75" precipitable
water values. The models have renewed rainfall maxima gradually
shifting from the Upper Midwest by midweek to adjacent portions of
the Mid-MS/OH Valleys late week with slow frontal progression. The
rain threat area drifts south next weekend down the plains, MS
Valley and from the OH Valley into the TN Valley, central-southern
Appalachians, and mid Atlantic.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread and uncertainty remains below
normal next week with exception of shortwaves progressing through
a mean Midwest trough and whether a closed low develops within the
500 mb trough next weekend near the Lakes/adjacent Canada. The WPC
medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend of
best clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET and ECMWF ensembles along with the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models. The composite maintains good WPC continuity and
acts to mitigate smaller scale guidance differences consistent
with predictability.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1228 AM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist across the West. Along the
periphery of the ridge, a shortwave trough will move into the
northern Rockies during the afternoon. A weak cold front will
accompany the trough within Montana. Strong heating will occur
within the Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.

...Northern Nevada into southern Idaho...
Elevated fire weather is expected to occur during the afternoon and
early evening. Strong heating in the Great Basin will drive a
thermal pressure trough and enhanced Zephyr winds across northwest
Nevada. Mid-level winds will be modest in Nevada, but will be
greater in Idaho as the shortwave moves across the area. Both areas
are expected to see similar conditions where 15-20 mph winds will
overlap 10-20% RH.

...Southwest Montana...
Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop along the higher
terrain as weak lift from the approaching shortwave trough moves in
during the early/mid afternoon. Storm coverage remains somewhat
uncertain, but lightning ignitions will remain efficient. In
surrounding areas, some locally elevated wind/RH combinations are
possible as the surface gradient increases along with mid-level
winds. Conditions may not be widespread, but several ongoing fires
will be affected by these dry and breezy conditions.

...Central Nevada...
Mid-level moisture will remain within the Southwest and extend in to
parts of the central Great Basin. Storm coverage may be quite low in
this region and storm motions will be rather slow. PWAT should be
sufficiently low to promote low-end potential for lightning over dry
fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A continued pattern of upper-level ridging across much of the West
is expected on Monday. Another low-amplitude shortwave trough will
move into the Northwest and northern Rockies during the
afternoon/evening. Mid-level moisture will continue to slowly build
north and west into the Great Basin.

...Nevada and southwest Utah...
Dry and windy conditions are expected to continue during the
afternoon. Wind appear that they will be somewhat stronger than on
Sunday given a marginally stronger surface pressure gradient. Winds
of 15-20 mph along with 10-20% RH will occur across most of northern
Nevada. Thunderstorms will be possible again in central Nevada into
southwest Utah. Storm coverage will see a slight increase given
greater mid-level moisture. Storm speeds will be slower to the south
and faster to the north. A mixed wet/dry mode is expected. Dry fuels
will support additional lightning ignitions.

...Central/eastern Oregon...
With the stronger surface pressure gradient, areas of 15-20 mph are
possible during the afternoon east of the Cascades. With 15-20% RH,
some ongoing fires could be impacted by locally elevated conditions.
Confidence in these conditions being sustained for more than an hour
or two remains low.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Northeast
and the Deep South...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. through
Monday...

More unsettled weather returns to the Northeast U.S. over the next
couple of days as a slow moving warm front advances northward and
leads to widespread moderate to heavy rain with embedded
thunderstorms.  It appears the heaviest rainfall will likely be
across northern Pennsylvania and central portions of upstate New
York, where some patchy 2 to 4 inch totals are possible through
Tuesday morning.  This may lead to some potential flooding and
rises on area rivers, especially over river basins that have
received above average rainfall over the past several days.

Portions of the Deep South are also expected to have bad weather
for Sunday and persisting into Monday as deep moisture from the
western Gulf of Mexico surges northward ahead of a slow moving
frontal boundary.  The heaviest rain is anticipated from eastern
Texas to northern Alabama, and some 3+ inch rainfall totals are
within the realm of possibility where repeated rounds of
thunderstorms develop.  There is also a Slight Risk of severe
storms across some of these same areas on Sunday, with high winds
and hail being the main threats with the storms that develop.

Excessive heat will continue to make weather headlines across the
western third of the nation, especially for California and the
lower elevations of Nevada and Arizona.  A stubborn upper level
high anchored over the Desert Southwest is the primary factor in
the ongoing heat wave, and this is expected to slowly erode some
going into the beginning of the week.  Additional record highs are
likely on Sunday, with excessive heat warnings in effect from
California to southern Idaho and western Utah.  It is also worth
noting that overnight lows have also been impressive with this
heat wave, with lows failing to drop below the lower 90s for the
normally warmer locations of the Desert Southwest.  Some localized
relief from the extreme heat may arrive in the form of monsoonal
showers and storms each day across portions of Arizona and New
Mexico.

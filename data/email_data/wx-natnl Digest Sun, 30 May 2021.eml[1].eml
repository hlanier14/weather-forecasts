Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Sat May 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...Central New Mexico...
On the western fringe of Gulf moisture moving into the central and
eastern portions of the state, scattered thunderstorms are expected
to from this afternoon and evening. Overlap between dry
boundary-layer conditions and convection is expected to be confined
to a narrow corridor within the higher terrain of central New
Mexico. Here, there is some potential for a few dry strikes to occur
within receptive fuels. As storms develop farther east later in the
day, increasing boundary-layer moisture should limit any dry thunder
potential.

Elsewhere, the elevated area for low humidity, gusty winds of 10-15
mph, and dry surface conditions across western New Mexico and
eastern Arizona remains unchanged. See the previous discussion for
more detail.

..Lyons.. 05/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Sat May 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will prevail across the southern Plains, as broad,
cyclonic upper flow becomes established across the Southwest and
mid-level troughs progress across the northern Plains and East Coast
areas today. Surface low pressure across the Lower Colorado River
Valley may promote 15 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
coincident with 10-20% RH during the afternoon, necessitating
Elevated highlights given the dry fuels in place.

While precipitation or moist low-level conditions will limit
widespread major wildfire-spread threats across most areas east of
the Rockies, a few areas may briefly experience localized
wildfire-spread potential. Portions of central Georgia into the
Florida Peninsula may experience brief bouts of overlapping Elevated
surface winds/RH by afternoon peak heating, where fuels are dry.
Parts of Lower Michigan may also see dry, breezy northeasterly flow
atop dry fuels during the afternoon, though it is unclear how recent
precipitation across the region has impacted fuels.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 PM EDT Sat May 29 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 01 2021 - 12Z Sat Jun 05 2021

...Record warmth likely Tuesday into Thursday across parts of the
West...
...Locally heavy rain possible mid-week from the southern Plains
into the Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The upper level pattern should become less amplified over the
course of the period. A shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest
around next Thursday will begin to erode the strong ridge
initially over parts of the West and upstream energy will likely
bring additional height falls to the Northwest toward the end of
the week. Farther east, expect troughing over the
Plains-Mississippi Valley to deepen/sharpen a bit through midweek
due to the early-period strength of the western ridge. The trough
should eventually accelerate somewhat and weaken, respectively due
to flatter mean flow to the west and a ridge over the western
Atlantic. Leading shortwave energy over the Great Lakes/Northeast
will depart early in the period. By next Saturday the latest
guidance indicates the possibility that some combination of energy
from northwestern Mexico and what may filter through/around the
western U.S. ridge could yield a weak trough/upper low over the
southern High Plains.

Guidance comparisons for the 00Z/06Z cycles were again
sufficiently good for an operational model blend to serve as the
basis of the forecast during the first half of the period.
Increasing shortwave detail uncertainties thereafter--from the
Pacific Northwest across southern Canada, as well as over the East
and southern High Plains--favored incorporating some ensemble mean
guidance (06Z GEFS/00Z ECens) along with the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and
small weight of the 00Z CMC by days 6-7 Friday-Saturday. This
consensus yielded two noticeable continuity changes, one toward a
somewhat weaker and more progressive trough emerging from the
Plains/Mississippi Valley after Thursday (with a corresponding
weaker surface reflection) and the other being the introduction of
a weak trough/upper low over the southern High Plains next
Saturday, a low-predictability evolution. In both cases a majority
of the trend has occurred in the latest cycle, tempering
confidence some, but with enough agreement to support at least an
intermediate blend. New 12Z guidance is mixed for the
Plains/Mississippi Valley trough, with the 12Z ECMWF adjusting
back at least halfway to pre-00Z runs but the GFS/UKMET are still
somewhat weaker/faster. Trends are mixed as well over the High
Plains by next Saturday. Also of note most 12Z models aside from
the ECMWF are suggesting greater separation of energy reaching the
West Coast Thursday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall will be along and ahead of the Central
U.S. upper trough as moisture pools along a wavy frontal system.
To start the period on Tuesday, the best chance for areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall will be from near southwestern
Texas into parts of Arkansas/Missouri. Much of this region has
already seen much above normal rainfall in the past couple of
weeks. From Wednesday onward, the activity should shift eastward
into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and the Northeast along a leading
warm front and trailing stationary front that eventually
dissipates. Even with a lack of frontal forcing by the end of the
week, lingering shortwave energy and moisture may be sufficient to
produce showers/thunderstorms of varying intensity into the
southern Appalachians and Southeast. After Tuesday confidence
decreases in resolving any particularly favorable areas of
heaviest rainfall but some pockets of moderate to heavy rain may
be possible on any day. Meanwhile the West should initially stay
dry beneath upper level ridging. Later next week incoming
shortwave energy may produce areas of scattered precipitation,
mainly from the Northwest into portions of the Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies during the medium range
period will be during Tuesday-Wednesday and to a lesser extent
Thursday from California and the Northwest into the Great Basin
where daytime highs of 15-25F above normal and possibly locally
higher may meet or exceed daily records. Morning lows may be warm
enough to challenge daily records across this same region into
Thursday as well. Weakening/progression of the western upper ridge
will yield a moderating trend over the Northwest in particular
late in the week along with a warming trend farther east across
the northern tier. By next Saturday there may be an axis of highs
at least 10-15F above normal from central California and the Great
Basin through the northern portions of the Plains/Great Lakes/New
England. The southern half of the Plains will be below normal (up
to minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) under cloudy and stormy skies
Tuesday and Wednesday followed by some lingering moderately below
normal readings over Texas. Much of the eastern U.S. should see
near-normal temperatures through the period aside from the warming
trend in the north by the end of the week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
254 PM EDT Sat May 29 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 01 2021 - 12Z Sat Jun 05 2021

...Record warmth likely Tuesday into Thursday across parts of the
West...
...Locally heavy rain possible mid-week from the southern Plains
into the Mississippi Valley...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The upper level pattern should become less amplified over the
course of the period. A shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest
around next Thursday will begin to erode the strong ridge
initially over parts of the West and upstream energy will likely
bring additional height falls to the Northwest toward the end of
the week. Farther east, expect troughing over the
Plains-Mississippi Valley to deepen/sharpen a bit through midweek
due to the early-period strength of the western ridge. The trough
should eventually accelerate somewhat and weaken, respectively due
to flatter mean flow to the west and a ridge over the western
Atlantic. Leading shortwave energy over the Great Lakes/Northeast
will depart early in the period. By next Saturday the latest
guidance indicates the possibility that some combination of energy
from northwestern Mexico and what may filter through/around the
western U.S. ridge could yield a weak trough/upper low over the
southern High Plains.

Guidance comparisons for the 00Z/06Z cycles were again
sufficiently good for an operational model blend to serve as the
basis of the forecast during the first half of the period.
Increasing shortwave detail uncertainties thereafter--from the
Pacific Northwest across southern Canada, as well as over the East
and southern High Plains--favored incorporating some ensemble mean
guidance (06Z GEFS/00Z ECens) along with the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and
small weight of the 00Z CMC by days 6-7 Friday-Saturday. This
consensus yielded two noticeable continuity changes, one toward a
somewhat weaker and more progressive trough emerging from the
Plains/Mississippi Valley after Thursday (with a corresponding
weaker surface reflection) and the other being the introduction of
a weak trough/upper low over the southern High Plains next
Saturday, a low-predictability evolution. In both cases a majority
of the trend has occurred in the latest cycle, tempering
confidence some, but with enough agreement to support at least an
intermediate blend. New 12Z guidance is mixed for the
Plains/Mississippi Valley trough, with the 12Z ECMWF adjusting
back at least halfway to pre-00Z runs but the GFS/UKMET are still
somewhat weaker/faster. Trends are mixed as well over the High
Plains by next Saturday. Also of note most 12Z models aside from
the ECMWF are suggesting greater separation of energy reaching the
West Coast Thursday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall will be along and ahead of the Central
U.S. upper trough as moisture pools along a wavy frontal system.
To start the period on Tuesday, the best chance for areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall will be from near southwestern
Texas into parts of Arkansas/Missouri. Much of this region has
already seen much above normal rainfall in the past couple of
weeks. From Wednesday onward, the activity should shift eastward
into the Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and the Northeast along a leading
warm front and trailing stationary front that eventually
dissipates. Even with a lack of frontal forcing by the end of the
week, lingering shortwave energy and moisture may be sufficient to
produce showers/thunderstorms of varying intensity into the
southern Appalachians and Southeast. After Tuesday confidence
decreases in resolving any particularly favorable areas of
heaviest rainfall but some pockets of moderate to heavy rain may
be possible on any day. Meanwhile the West should initially stay
dry beneath upper level ridging. Later next week incoming
shortwave energy may produce areas of scattered precipitation,
mainly from the Northwest into portions of the Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies during the medium range
period will be during Tuesday-Wednesday and to a lesser extent
Thursday from California and the Northwest into the Great Basin
where daytime highs of 15-25F above normal and possibly locally
higher may meet or exceed daily records. Morning lows may be warm
enough to challenge daily records across this same region into
Thursday as well. Weakening/progression of the western upper ridge
will yield a moderating trend over the Northwest in particular
late in the week along with a warming trend farther east across
the northern tier. By next Saturday there may be an axis of highs
at least 10-15F above normal from central California and the Great
Basin through the northern portions of the Plains/Great Lakes/New
England. The southern half of the Plains will be below normal (up
to minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) under cloudy and stormy skies
Tuesday and Wednesday followed by some lingering moderately below
normal readings over Texas. Much of the eastern U.S. should see
near-normal temperatures through the period aside from the warming
trend in the north by the end of the week.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 29 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...North Dakota...
Model uncertainty remains high with regard to the coverage of
elevated fire weather conditions in the wake of a cold front moving
across the region. Soundings do show some potential for deep mixing
and drying colocated with northwesterly winds of 10 to 15 mph for a
few hours around peak heating. However, mostly unfavorable fuel
conditions and the considerable uncertainty suggest any fire weather
threat will remain local in nature.

Across southwestern New Mexico, minimal changes were made to the
elevated area to updated it for newly available model guidance.

..Lyons.. 05/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Sat May 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughs will continue progressing across the northern and
eastern CONUS while broad cyclonic upper flow persists across the
Southwest tomorrow. A weak surface low will continue to meander
across the Lower Colorado River Valley, promoting 15 mph sustained
southwesterly winds and 10-15% RH across western New Mexico during
the afternoon, where Elevated highlights have been introduced.
Otherwise, modest northwesterly mid-level flow will overspread a dry
boundary layer over North Dakota tomorrow afternoon, with downward
mixing promoting 15-20 mph sustained west-northwesterly surface
winds. RH may briefly reach Elevated criteria, but RH marginally
supportive of fire spread precludes Elevated highlights at this
time.

...Additional rounds of severe weather and flash flooding possible
across the central and southern Plains through the weekend...

...Below average temperatures found throughout much of the central
and eastern United States, while heat builds in the West...

Unsettled weather is expected to continue across portions of the
central and eastern U.S. through the remainder of the weekend,
with hazardous weather conditions likely across parts of central
and southern High Plains.

Thunderstorms are forecast to develop this afternoon along the
central and southern High Plains.  Some of these storms may become
strong to severe, with scattered large hail, brief tornadoes, and
isolated severe wind gusts possible -- especially across portions
of eastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, and the western Texas and
Oklahoma panhandles.  Heavy rainfall, leading to localized flash
flooding is also a concern, particularly across parts of eastern
Colorado, western Kansas, the Oklahoma and far northern Texas
panhandles, as well as far northeastern New Mexico.

Storms are expected to diminish overnight into early Sunday,
before redeveloping during the afternoon, with severe weather
becoming more likely across a broader portion of the southern High
Plains.  Widely scattered severe thunderstorms are possible across
eastern New Mexico into western Texas, with large to very large
hail and damaging wind gusts expected to be the primary hazards.
Heavy rainfall leading to localized flash flooding is also
possible -- especially from Northwest Texas and the Texas
Panhandle to western Oklahoma.

Showers and storms will likely develop once again on Monday, with
heavy to excessive rainfall possible across portions of Northwest
Texas into southwestern Oklahoma.  Severe thunderstorms will also
be possible once again, but with the threat expected to be more
confined to portions of southwestern Texas.  With showers and
thunderstorms likely all three days, temperatures are forecast to
seasonal to below-normal across much of the central and southern
Plains through Memorial Day.

Rainy and cool conditions are also expected to continue across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast.  An area of low pressure developing
along the Mid-Atlantic coast is forecast to bring additional rains
to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, as it tracks north along the
coast on Sunday.  While high pressure is expected to bring dry
conditions back into the Mid-Atlantic on Monday, wet conditions
are expected to continue across portions of the Northeast as the
low tracks along the New England coast into Atlantic Canada.

While much of the Southeast can expect dry conditions on Sunday
and Monday, showers and thunderstorms are forecast both days along
and ahead of cold front settling into central Florida by the
latter half of the weekend.

In contrast with the central and eastern U.S., dry conditions are
expected across the West, with well-above average temperatures
building across the region early next week.  Excessive Heat
Warnings and Watches, and Heat Advisories have been issued for
parts of southwestern Oregon, in addition to much of interior
Northern California, and the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin
valley for early next.  Highs are forecast to reach the upper-90s
and triple digits beginning Sunday.  Temperatures are forecast to
climb further on Monday, with record-breaking highs expected for
portions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys.

...Record warmth likely Wednesday and Thursday across parts of the
West...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The medium range period starts Tuesday as a rather amplified
pattern with strong ridging over much of the West and troughing
over the Central/Midwest states. After Thursday though, the
pattern should become less amplified as a couple of shortwaves
into the Pacific Northwest will erode the upper ridge and push the
central U.S. troughing eastward as it also weakens. The latest
guidance also continues to indicate the possibility that some
combination of energy from northwestern Mexico and what may filter
through/around the western U.S. ridge could yield a weak
trough/upper low over the southern High Plains.

Models and ensembles continue to show sufficient agreement for an
operational model blend to serve as the starting point for the
forecast for days 3 and 4. After this, increasing shortwave detail
uncertainties begin to arise, particularly regarding Northwest
U.S. shortwave timing/amplitude as well as whatever energy hangs
around the Southern Plains late in the period. The ensemble means
however do show good agreement through the entire week, so the WPC
forecast is heavily skewed towards the means by day 7. Minor
contributions from the deterministic GFS/ECMWF were continued
through the entire period to help maintain some system definition
and strength.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall will be ahead of the Central U.S.
upper trough as moisture pools along a wavy and weakening frontal
system. The activity should shift eastward with time into the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys and the Northeast, with pockets of moderate
to heavy rainfall likely somewhere, but impossible to pin down
those kinds of details at this time. Even with a lack of frontal
forcing by the end of the week, lingering shortwave energy and
moisture may be sufficient to also produce showers/thunderstorms
of varying intensity into the southern Appalachians and Southeast.
Meanwhile the West should initially be dry, but trend more
unsettled later in the week as incoming shortwave energy may
produce areas of scattered precipitation, mainly from the
Northwest into portions of the Rockies.

The most extreme temperature anomalies during the medium range
period will be from Wednesday-Thursday from California and the
Northwest into the Great Basin where daytime highs of 15-25F above
normal and possibly locally higher may meet or exceed daily
records. Morning lows may be warm enough to challenge daily
records across this same region into Thursday as well.
Weakening/progression of the western upper ridge will yield a
moderating trend over the Northwest in particular late in the week
along with a warming trend farther east across the northern tier
and eventually the Northeast. Portions of the Pacific Northwest
may actually drop a couple degrees below normal by next weekend as
lowered heights move through. The southern half of the Plains will
be moderately below normal under cloudy and stormy skies on
Wednesday followed by some lingering below normal readings over
Texas. Much of the eastern U.S. should see near-normal
temperatures through the period aside from the warming trend in
the north by the end of the week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Sun May 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will prevail across the Southern Plains as mid-level
troughs move across the northern Plains, eastern U.S., and the
Southwest today. Moist low-level conditions, a relatively calm
large-scale wind field, and appreciable rainfall accumulations will
hinder significant wildfire spread potential across much of the
CONUS east of the Rockies. Surface low pressure across the Lower
Colorado River Basin will promote a few hours of Elevated surface
winds/RH across portions of western into central New Mexico, where
Elevated highlights have been maintained. Otherwise, locally
Elevated conditions may occur along the backside of the mid-level
trough across the northern Plains. The best chance for briefly
overlapping favorable surface winds/RH conducive to any fire spread
would most likely be over northern North Dakota by afternoon peak
heating.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
High pressure is expected to build along the West Coast as broad
cyclonic mid-level flow with multiple embedded upper troughs
overspreads much of the CONUS tomorrow. Moist low-level conditions
and weak surface winds will continue to limit significant wildfire
spread potential across much of the CONUS east of the Rockies. Given
the relatively benign upper pattern across the Southwest tomorrow
afternoon, wildfire-spread concerns are expected to be limited to
terrain-favoring locations, where surface winds may briefly reach 15
mph amidst 10-15% RH.

...Additional rounds of severe weather and flash flooding possible
across the central and southern Plains through Tuesday...

...Light to moderate rain, well below average temperatures, and
coastal flooding found across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today
before gradually clearing on Memorial Day...

...Excessive and potentially record-breaking heat to impact
central and northern California to end the month...

Like a broken record, today will yet again feature chances for
severe weather and flash flooding across the central and southern
High Plains. Thunderstorms are expected to develop over eastern
New Mexico this afternoon and slowly push eastward into West Texas
by this evening. A few storms will be capable of producing large
hail, damaging wind gusts, and isolated tornadoes. Additionally,
flash flooding will also remain a possibility where ongoing heavy
rain is currently falling across southwest Kansas, as well as the
southern High Plains thanks to the slow moving nature of the
thunderstorms. By Monday, a cold front located over the region
will push southward and shift the threat of severe thunderstorms
to southwest Texas and far southeast New Mexico. The Big Bend in
particular will have the greatest risk of destructive hail and
tornadoes. SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms
for this section of Texas on Memorial Day. Showers and
thunderstorms capable of intense downpours will be found elsewhere
across the southern Plains to end the month of May, with maximum
rainfall amounts over 3 inches possible. WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall on Monday that extends from
south-central Oklahoma to north-central Texas.

Another day of cool, damp, and dreary weather is in store for the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast today as a coastal low pressure system
begins to develop. Light to moderate rain is forecast to fall from
the Delmarva Peninsula to Maine, with the highest rainfall amounts
located throughout New England. Gusty northeast winds and chilly
temperatures will also accompany the system, with Coastal Flood
Warnings and Advisories extending from the Chesapeake Bay to
Massachusetts. In case that wasn't enough to ruin outdoor
activities or a day at the beach, temperatures 20 to 30 degrees
below average remain locked over the region. Highs are forecast to
only reach the upper-50s as far south as Virginia, which is
expected to lead to plethora of daily records. Fortunately, the
aforementioned low pressure system should begin to exit the
Northeast on Memorial Day and lead to increasingly pleasant
weather as we head into the beginning of June.

Meanwhile, a building upper-level ridge over the western U.S. will
likely lead to the hottest temperatures felt so far this year
throughout the West. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
have been issued for northern and central California, where triple
digit high temperatures are forecast today and Monday. This is
also likely to exacerbate the growing extreme and exceptional
drought conditions found throughout the region.

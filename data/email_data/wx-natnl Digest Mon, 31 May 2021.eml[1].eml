Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Sun May 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with no major changes. Locally
elevated conditions may persist for a couple hours this afternoon
across North Dakota where somewhat receptive fuels and dry/windy
conditions overlap.

..Lyons.. 05/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Sun May 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will prevail across the Southern Plains as mid-level
troughs move across the northern Plains, eastern U.S., and the
Southwest today. Moist low-level conditions, a relatively calm
large-scale wind field, and appreciable rainfall accumulations will
hinder significant wildfire spread potential across much of the
CONUS east of the Rockies. Surface low pressure across the Lower
Colorado River Basin will promote a few hours of Elevated surface
winds/RH across portions of western into central New Mexico, where
Elevated highlights have been maintained. Otherwise, locally
Elevated conditions may occur along the backside of the mid-level
trough across the northern Plains. The best chance for briefly
overlapping favorable surface winds/RH conducive to any fire spread
would most likely be over northern North Dakota by afternoon peak
heating.

...Record warmth likely Wednesday and Thursday across parts of the
West...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the period with a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. and western Canada by next
weekend--replacing the strong ridge over the West at the start of
the period Wednesday--while eastern North America heights
eventually rise and mean ridging prevails over the western
Atlantic. However between the consensus developing Northwest
trough and Atlantic ridge, there is considerable spread for what
becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley trough and a
potential High Plains upper trough/low toward the end of the week
and next weekend. Specifics of these lower-confidence features
will likely have considerable influence on the distribution and
intensity of rainfall over the eastern two-thirds of the lower 48.

The preference for resolving guidance spread continued to be with
an operational blend early in the period followed by a transition
to a model/ensemble mean mix to represent the most common aspects
of the large scale pattern. If anything, latest guidance has
become even more diverse with possible outcomes for the
Plains/Mississippi Valley upper trough that may drift into the
East. The last two CMC runs show the most dramatic change, from
the 00Z version that brought the core of the trough to the
Mid-Atlantic by next Sunday to the new 12Z run that keeps an upper
low over the Mississippi Valley through next weekend (hinted at by
the 00Z CMC mean).  In contrast the 06Z/12Z GFS runs are quite
rapid in ejecting a majority of the energy, though the 12Z run
does hold back a compact upper low for a time. The 00Z GFS was
somewhat closer in principle to latest ECMWF runs and GEFS/ECMWF
means and thus was the run used in the updated forecast blend. The
new ECMWF is still closest to the GEFS/ECMWF means. Solutions are
also diverging/trending for leading shortwave energy that nears
the West Coast by Thursday-Friday, with CMC/UKMET runs pulling off
a closed low farther offshore California. The 12Z GFS/ECMWF pull
off a little energy but to such a weak degree there is no closed
contour, while being more progressive with the rest. Details of
the possible trough/upper low over the High Plains next weekend
are also ambiguous but at least the GEFS/ECMWF means and most
GFS/ECMWF runs have maintained this feature in some fashion over
the past day. Finally, the model/mean blend smooths out
low-predictability detail differences within the otherwise
agreeable late-period Northwest trough.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best focus for rainfall around midweek or so will be along a
wavy frontal system forecast to weaken ahead of the Central U.S.
upper trough. There is some signal for one or more bands of
moderate-heavy rainfall from parts of the Mid-Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes. After the front
dissipates, the combination of moist flow around Bermuda high
pressure and the lingering upper trough over the east-central U.S.
may support areas of moderate to heavy rainfall reaching into the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast by late in the week. Some diurnally favored
showers/thunderstorms may persist over the southern half of the
East through the weekend. Confidence remains moderate to low in
specifics. Over the southern Plains and vicinity, a lingering
front early in the period followed by possible development of a
High Plains upper trough/low may promote episodes of
showers/storms but again with fairly low confidence in the details
at this time. Most of the West will be dry through midweek,
followed by a gradual increase of moisture over the Northwest as
flow aloft trends toward a broad trough. Some light to moderate
totals will be possible over the Pacific Northwest with some
activity also possible over the northern Rockies and eventually
spreading eastward across the northern tier.

Expect very warm to hot conditions over much of the West through
Wednesday-Thursday. The most extreme anomalies should extend from
California and the Northwest into the Great Basin where daytime
highs of 15-25F above normal and possibly locally higher may meet
or exceed daily records. Morning lows may also be warm enough to
challenge daily records across this same region. The trend toward
cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next weekend and rising
heights over eastern North America will gradually suppress the
heat over the West and spread above normal readings across the
northern tier into the Northeast. Western areas should still see
decent coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs through late
week before a fairly narrow ribbon of plus 10F or so anomalies
extends from central California into the central Rockies by
Sunday. Also at that time the Northwest may see highs drop
slightly below normal. Meanwhile highs reaching 15-25F above
normal over parts of the northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley
toward the end of the week could challenge daily records at a few
locations. Portions of the northern Plains into New England should
see highs 10-20F above normal next weekend. In contrast the
southern Plains will tend to see highs up to 5-10F below normal
due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms. The southern half of the
East should see near-normal readings for most of the period.

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 02 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 06 2021

...Record warmth likely Wednesday and Thursday across parts of the
West...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the period with a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. and western Canada by next
weekend--replacing the strong ridge over the West at the start of
the period Wednesday--while eastern North America heights
eventually rise and mean ridging prevails over the western
Atlantic. However between the consensus developing Northwest
trough and Atlantic ridge, there is considerable spread for what
becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley trough and a
potential High Plains upper trough/low toward the end of the week
and next weekend. Specifics of these lower-confidence features
will likely have considerable influence on the distribution and
intensity of rainfall over the eastern two-thirds of the lower 48.

The preference for resolving guidance spread continued to be with
an operational blend early in the period followed by a transition
to a model/ensemble mean mix to represent the most common aspects
of the large scale pattern. If anything, latest guidance has
become even more diverse with possible outcomes for the
Plains/Mississippi Valley upper trough that may drift into the
East. The last two CMC runs show the most dramatic change, from
the 00Z version that brought the core of the trough to the
Mid-Atlantic by next Sunday to the new 12Z run that keeps an upper
low over the Mississippi Valley through next weekend (hinted at by
the 00Z CMC mean).  In contrast the 06Z/12Z GFS runs are quite
rapid in ejecting a majority of the energy, though the 12Z run
does hold back a compact upper low for a time. The 00Z GFS was
somewhat closer in principle to latest ECMWF runs and GEFS/ECMWF
means and thus was the run used in the updated forecast blend. The
new ECMWF is still closest to the GEFS/ECMWF means. Solutions are
also diverging/trending for leading shortwave energy that nears
the West Coast by Thursday-Friday, with CMC/UKMET runs pulling off
a closed low farther offshore California. The 12Z GFS/ECMWF pull
off a little energy but to such a weak degree there is no closed
contour, while being more progressive with the rest. Details of
the possible trough/upper low over the High Plains next weekend
are also ambiguous but at least the GEFS/ECMWF means and most
GFS/ECMWF runs have maintained this feature in some fashion over
the past day. Finally, the model/mean blend smooths out
low-predictability detail differences within the otherwise
agreeable late-period Northwest trough.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best focus for rainfall around midweek or so will be along a
wavy frontal system forecast to weaken ahead of the Central U.S.
upper trough. There is some signal for one or more bands of
moderate-heavy rainfall from parts of the Mid-Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes. After the front
dissipates, the combination of moist flow around Bermuda high
pressure and the lingering upper trough over the east-central U.S.
may support areas of moderate to heavy rainfall reaching into the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast by late in the week. Some diurnally favored
showers/thunderstorms may persist over the southern half of the
East through the weekend. Confidence remains moderate to low in
specifics. Over the southern Plains and vicinity, a lingering
front early in the period followed by possible development of a
High Plains upper trough/low may promote episodes of
showers/storms but again with fairly low confidence in the details
at this time. Most of the West will be dry through midweek,
followed by a gradual increase of moisture over the Northwest as
flow aloft trends toward a broad trough. Some light to moderate
totals will be possible over the Pacific Northwest with some
activity also possible over the northern Rockies and eventually
spreading eastward across the northern tier.

Expect very warm to hot conditions over much of the West through
Wednesday-Thursday. The most extreme anomalies should extend from
California and the Northwest into the Great Basin where daytime
highs of 15-25F above normal and possibly locally higher may meet
or exceed daily records. Morning lows may also be warm enough to
challenge daily records across this same region. The trend toward
cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next weekend and rising
heights over eastern North America will gradually suppress the
heat over the West and spread above normal readings across the
northern tier into the Northeast. Western areas should still see
decent coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs through late
week before a fairly narrow ribbon of plus 10F or so anomalies
extends from central California into the central Rockies by
Sunday. Also at that time the Northwest may see highs drop
slightly below normal. Meanwhile highs reaching 15-25F above
normal over parts of the northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley
toward the end of the week could challenge daily records at a few
locations. Portions of the northern Plains into New England should
see highs 10-20F above normal next weekend. In contrast the
southern Plains will tend to see highs up to 5-10F below normal
due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms. The southern half of the
East should see near-normal readings for most of the period.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 30 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CDT Sun May 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern California...
A building ridge of high pressure will promote very warm and dry
conditions across much of the western US on Day2/Monday. Gusty
onshore winds of 10-20 mph are forecast to develop in the afternoon
supporting elevated fire weather potential across the interior
valleys and ranges of southern California. While favorable
conditions are not expected to be widespread, low surface RH (5-10%)
and unseasonably dry fuels will may encourage locally
elevated/critical fire weather concerns.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, mostly unfavorable conditions are
expected to support only limited fire weather potential. No
probabilities will be maintained. See the previous discussion for
more details.

..Lyons.. 05/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Sun May 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
High pressure is expected to build along the West Coast as broad
cyclonic mid-level flow with multiple embedded upper troughs
overspreads much of the CONUS tomorrow. Moist low-level conditions
and weak surface winds will continue to limit significant wildfire
spread potential across much of the CONUS east of the Rockies. Given
the relatively benign upper pattern across the Southwest tomorrow
afternoon, wildfire-spread concerns are expected to be limited to
terrain-favoring locations, where surface winds may briefly reach 15
mph amidst 10-15% RH.

...Heat wave to expand across the western U.S....

...Additional rounds of severe weather and flash flooding possible
across the central and southern Plains through Tuesday...

...Light to moderate rain and well below-average temperatures to
continue across the Northeast into Monday before clearing on
Tuesday...

As stormy conditions continue across the Plains through midweek,
record-breaking heat is expected to build across the West.
Meanwhile, drier weather and more seasonal temperatures are
forecast to return to most of eastern U.S. by Tuesday.

Well-above normal temperatures across the West are expected to
increase further on Monday, with triple-digit, record-breaking
highs forecast for portions of the central valleys of California
on Monday.  The heat will build farther north into the Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday, and then into the Intermountain West and
northern Rockies on Wednesday.  On Wednesday, record-breaking
temperatures are expected from central California to western
Montana.  Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect for Monday and
Tuesday for the central valleys of California, while heat
advisories are in place for a large portion of northern California
into southwestern Oregon.  An Excessive Heat Watch for Wednesday
is now in effect for Death Valley National Park and for portions
of southern Nevada.

Farther east, showers and thunderstorms will continue to develop
this afternoon from the central and southern Rockies into the
Plains.  Some storms may become strong to severe -- with scattered
severe hail and wind, along with a few tornadoes possible across
the southern High Plains, especially during the afternoon and
evening hours.  Heavy rainfall accumulations, resulting in flash
flooding are also a concern -- especially across portions of
Northwest Texas into the Panhandle region.  WPC has upgraded a
portion of this region to a Moderate Risk for excessive rainfall
on Sunday -- indicating that numerous flash flood are possible.

More stormy weather is expected for the central and southern
Plains on Monday.  However, the threat for severe thunderstorms is
forecast to be more confined to parts of southwestern Texas and
southeastern New Mexico.  Heavy rainfall, leading to localized
flooding is expected to be a bigger concern farther to the north
across portions of northwestern Texas and western Oklahoma.

While continuing across the Plains, showers and thunderstorms will
begin to reach farther east into the mid and lower Mississippi
Valley on Wednesday.  However at this point, the potential for
both severe thunderstorms and flooding rains appears to be more
limited.

Across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest, showers and
thunderstorms will likely continue to develop this afternoon, with
isolated severe storms possible across northern Minnesota.  The
threat is forecast to move farther east into central Wisconsin and
portions of northern Michigan on Monday.

In the East, low pressure moving north along the coast will bring
another day of clouds, rain and below-normal temperatures to the
Northeast on Monday.  Meanwhile, high pressure shifting east from
the Ohio Valley will support the return of drier weather and more
seasonal temperatures into the Mid Atlantic and Southeast on
Monday.  By Tuesday, with the low tracking well north into eastern
Canada, drier weather and more seasonable temperatures are
forecast for much of the eastern U.S.  One exception may be
central and southern Florida, where a lingering frontal boundary
is expected to support showers and thunderstorms through midweek.

...Record warmth likely through Thursday across parts of the
West...

...Another round of heavy rainfall possible for parts of the
Southern Plains next weekend...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most of the guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday). This means strong ridging over the West to
start the period Thursday will be replaced by a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. by the weekend. Meanwhile, heights are
forecast to rise across the East as mean ridging prevails over the
western Atlantic. Between this however, there remains considerable
spread on what becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley
trough and a High Plains upper trough (or low). The specifics of
these features will likely have considerable influence on the
distribution and intensity of rainfall over the eastern two-thirds
of the lower 48.

The models and ensembles show good agreement the first couple of
days to warrant a purely operational model blend for days 3 and 4.
After this, the guidance cannot seem to agree on what to do with
the troughing across the Midwest. The most outlier solution is
still the 12z CMC which keeps an upper level low over the
Mississippi Valley through Monday. Meanwhile, the GFS is the
quickest to race the northern stream energy into the Northeast on
Saturday, while the ECMWF hangs the energy back across the
Mid-Atlantic, but in a much weaker fashion than the CMC would
suggest. The ECMWF is however the solution closest to that of the
ensemble means. There is also plenty of questions on leading
shortwave energy reaching the West Coast next Thursday-Friday,
with the latest runs of the CMC/UKMET continuing to pull off a
closed low farther offshore California. The GFS and ECMWF also
have this detaching energy but to a much weaker degree. Finally,
details of the possible trough/upper low over the High Plains next
weekend continue to be problematic but at least the GEFS/ECENS
means and most of the GFS/ECMWF runs have maintained this feature
in some way for several cycles now. The blend for this forecast
was quickly skewed towards the ensemble means for days 5-7 to help
smooth out all the lower predictability details of the various
systems while maintaining smaller parts of the ECMWF for added
feature definition. This approach also maintains good continuity
with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best focus for rainfall to begin the period will be ahead of
the Central U.S. upper trough. There is some signal for at least
locally moderate-heavy rainfall from parts of the Tennessee Valley
into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. Over the southern Plains and
vicinity, a lingering front early in the period may promote
episodes of showers/storms Thursday and Friday. The guidance is
beginning to trend wetter across parts of southern/eastern Texas
and into southern Louisiana in response to likely trough/upper low
across the High Plains next weekend. Even the ensemble means (and
the NBM) are showing at least an inch or two of rainfall possible
next weekend, with some deterministic model runs hinting at the
potential for much more than that. This of course is highly
dependent on flow details regarding the High Plains energy, but
this region is already highly susceptible to any kind of heavy
rainfall given much above normal precipitation over the past few
weeks. Out West, a gradual increase of moisture over the Northwest
is expected as flow aloft trends toward a broad trough. Some light
to moderate totals will be possible over the Pacific Northwest
with some activity also possible over the northern Rockies and
eventually spreading eastward across the northern tier.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) across the central and
northern Great Basin will continue into Thursday with both daytime
highs and warm morning lows near or exceeding record values. The
trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat over the West and spread above normal
readings across the northern tier into the Northeast. A handful of
locations in the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley may also
challenge daily records into the weekend. Parts of the Northwest
may actually dip slightly below normal by next Sunday-Monday as
well. Elsewhere, the southern Plains will tend to see highs up to
5-10F below normal due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms while
the southern half of the East should see near-normal readings for
most of the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Mon May 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will continue to build along the West Coast as broad
troughing prevails across the central and eastern CONUS today.
Thermal-low development across central California will promote
onshore dry and breezy conditions supportive of some wildfire-spread
concerns. Accumulating rainfall across the southern Plains and weak
surface winds across the eastern third of the CONUS is expected to
limit widespread significant wildfire-spread potential. Terrain
favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River Basin may experience
brief periods of channeled flow, with locally Elevated conditions
possible during the afternoon given widespread 10-15% RH.

...Central California...
Upper ridging along the West Coast will promote very warm
temperatures (exceeding 90F by afternoon peak heating) across much
of California, where surface thermal-low development and associated
onshore flow is expected during the afternoon. Downslope flow along
the Diablo Range will promote 15 mph sustained westerly surface
winds and 10-20% RH atop unseasonably dry fuels across the lower
Sacramento into the San Joaquin Valleys, as shown by some of the
latest high-resolution guidance. The very warm temperatures may also
support localized plume-dominated wildfire potential in and
surrounding the Elevated area, where upslope flow across
terrain-favoring areas overlaps with the 90+ F surface temperatures.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Mon May 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1, upper ridging along the West Coast and broad upper
troughing across the central/eastern CONUS is expected to persist
tomorrow. A thermal low will once again become established across
central California, promoting dry onshore flow and some
wildfire-spread potential. Appreciable rainfall accumulations across
the southern CONUS, with calmer winds/moist low-level conditions
across the eastern CONUS, will both serve to hinder significant
wildfire-spread potential. Locally dry and breezy conditions will
also support briefly Elevated wildfire-spread potential across the
Lower Colorado River Valley in terrain-favoring areas given 10-15%
RH and receptive fuels.

...Central California...
As the axis of the upper ridge centers over California tomorrow
afternoon, surface temperatures approaching 100 F by afternoon peak
heating will support thermal low development across the central
California Valley region. 15+ mph downslope flow along the lee of
the Diablo Range will support Elevated conditions across the San
Joaquin Valley given very dry fuels and 10-20% RH. Localized
plume-dominated wildfire potential will again be possible across
much of central California given the very warm temperatures.

...Record warmth likely through Thursday across parts of the
West...

...Heavy rainfall possible for parts of the Southern Plains
Saturday and Sunday...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most of the guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday). This means strong ridging over the West to
start the period Thursday will be replaced by a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. by the weekend. Meanwhile, heights are
forecast to rise across the East as mean ridging prevails over the
western Atlantic. Between this however, there remains considerable
spread on what becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley
trough and a High Plains upper trough (or low). The specifics of
these features will likely have considerable influence on the
distribution and intensity of rainfall over the eastern two-thirds
of the lower 48.

The models and ensembles show good agreement the first couple of
days to warrant a purely operational model blend for days 3 and 4.
After this, the guidance cannot seem to agree on what to do with
the troughing across the Midwest. The most outlier solution is
still the 12z CMC which keeps an upper level low over the
Mississippi Valley through Monday. Meanwhile, the GFS is the
quickest to race the northern stream energy into the Northeast on
Saturday, while the ECMWF hangs the energy back across the
Mid-Atlantic, but in a much weaker fashion than the CMC would
suggest. The ECMWF is however the solution closest to that of the
ensemble means. There is also plenty of questions on leading
shortwave energy reaching the West Coast next Thursday-Friday,
with the latest runs of the CMC/UKMET continuing to pull off a
closed low farther offshore California. The GFS and ECMWF also
have this detaching energy but to a much weaker degree. Finally,
details of the possible trough/upper low over the High Plains next
weekend continue to be problematic but at least the GEFS/ECENS
means and most of the GFS/ECMWF runs have maintained this feature
in some way for several cycles now. The blend for this forecast
was quickly skewed towards the ensemble means for days 5-7 to help
smooth out all the lower predictability details of the various
systems while maintaining smaller parts of the ECMWF for added
feature definition. This approach also maintains good continuity
with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best focus for rainfall to begin the period will be ahead of
the Central U.S. upper trough. There is some signal for at least
locally moderate-heavy rainfall from parts of the Tennessee Valley
into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. Over the southern Plains and
vicinity, a lingering front early in the period may promote
episodes of showers/storms Thursday and Friday. The guidance is
beginning to trend wetter across parts of southern/eastern Texas
and into southern Louisiana in response to likely trough/upper low
across the High Plains next weekend. Even the ensemble means (and
the NBM) are showing at least an inch or two of rainfall possible
next weekend, with some deterministic model runs hinting at the
potential for much more than that. This of course is highly
dependent on flow details regarding the High Plains energy, but
this region is already highly susceptible to any kind of heavy
rainfall given much above normal precipitation over the past few
weeks. Out West, a gradual increase of moisture over the Northwest
is expected as flow aloft trends toward a broad trough. Some light
to moderate totals will be possible over the Pacific Northwest
with some activity also possible over the northern Rockies and
eventually spreading eastward across the northern tier.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) across the central and
northern Great Basin will continue into Thursday with both daytime
highs and warm morning lows near or exceeding record values. The
trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat over the West and spread above normal
readings across the northern tier into the Northeast. A handful of
locations in the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley may also
challenge daily records into the weekend. Parts of the Northwest
may actually dip slightly below normal by next Sunday-Monday as
well. Elsewhere, the southern Plains will tend to see highs up to
5-10F below normal due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms while
the southern half of the East should see near-normal readings for
most of the period.

...Record warmth likely through Thursday across parts of the
West...

...Heavy rainfall possible for parts of the Southern Plains
Saturday and Sunday...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most of the guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday). This means strong ridging over the West to
start the period Thursday will be replaced by a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. by the weekend. Meanwhile, heights are
forecast to rise across the East as mean ridging prevails over the
western Atlantic. Between this however, there remains considerable
spread on what becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley
trough and a High Plains upper trough (or low). The specifics of
these features will likely have considerable influence on the
distribution and intensity of rainfall over the eastern two-thirds
of the lower 48.

The models and ensembles show good agreement the first couple of
days to warrant a purely operational model blend for days 3 and 4.
After this, the guidance cannot seem to agree on what to do with
the troughing across the Midwest. The most outlier solution is
still the 12z CMC which keeps an upper level low over the
Mississippi Valley through Monday. Meanwhile, the GFS is the
quickest to race the northern stream energy into the Northeast on
Saturday, while the ECMWF hangs the energy back across the
Mid-Atlantic, but in a much weaker fashion than the CMC would
suggest. The ECMWF is however the solution closest to that of the
ensemble means. There is also plenty of questions on leading
shortwave energy reaching the West Coast next Thursday-Friday,
with the latest runs of the CMC/UKMET continuing to pull off a
closed low farther offshore California. The GFS and ECMWF also
have this detaching energy but to a much weaker degree. Finally,
details of the possible trough/upper low over the High Plains next
weekend continue to be problematic but at least the GEFS/ECENS
means and most of the GFS/ECMWF runs have maintained this feature
in some way for several cycles now. The blend for this forecast
was quickly skewed towards the ensemble means for days 5-7 to help
smooth out all the lower predictability details of the various
systems while maintaining smaller parts of the ECMWF for added
feature definition. This approach also maintains good continuity
with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best focus for rainfall to begin the period will be ahead of
the Central U.S. upper trough. There is some signal for at least
locally moderate-heavy rainfall from parts of the Tennessee Valley
into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. Over the southern Plains and
vicinity, a lingering front early in the period may promote
episodes of showers/storms Thursday and Friday. The guidance is
beginning to trend wetter across parts of southern/eastern Texas
and into southern Louisiana in response to likely trough/upper low
across the High Plains next weekend. Even the ensemble means (and
the NBM) are showing at least an inch or two of rainfall possible
next weekend, with some deterministic model runs hinting at the
potential for much more than that. This of course is highly
dependent on flow details regarding the High Plains energy, but
this region is already highly susceptible to any kind of heavy
rainfall given much above normal precipitation over the past few
weeks. Out West, a gradual increase of moisture over the Northwest
is expected as flow aloft trends toward a broad trough. Some light
to moderate totals will be possible over the Pacific Northwest
with some activity also possible over the northern Rockies and
eventually spreading eastward across the northern tier.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) across the central and
northern Great Basin will continue into Thursday with both daytime
highs and warm morning lows near or exceeding record values. The
trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat over the West and spread above normal
readings across the northern tier into the Northeast. A handful of
locations in the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley may also
challenge daily records into the weekend. Parts of the Northwest
may actually dip slightly below normal by next Sunday-Monday as
well. Elsewhere, the southern Plains will tend to see highs up to
5-10F below normal due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms while
the southern half of the East should see near-normal readings for
most of the period.

...Excessive heat found across the western United States...

...Heavy rain and flash flooding are likely today across portions
of north-central Texas, while severe weather remains possible
across the southern High Plains...

...Showers and thunderstorms to spread eastward into the
Lower/Middle Mississippi and Ohio valleys by Tuesday...

Blistering heat will be felt across the western U.S. this Memorial
Day and extend into the beginning of June. Triple digit high
temperatures are forecast across the Southwest and portions of
central and northern California, which could break a few daily
high temperature records over the next couple of days. Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories have been issued throughout
central and northern sections of the Golden State. Residents are
advised to drink plenty of water and avoid extended periods of
time outdoors if possible. The heat is expected to expand north
and into the Northwest on Tuesday. High temperatures in the 90s
are forecast as far north as interior Washington.

Much of the Southern Plains will once again need umbrellas handy
as widespread shower and thunderstorm activity closes out the
month of May. A low pressure system located over Oklahoma and a
slow moving attached cold front extending across central and
western Texas will be the focus for thunderstorm complexes and
numerous downpours. The biggest impact from these thunderstorms
will likely be associated with flash flooding. Much of
north-central Texas has seen above normal rainfall over the last
two weeks and an additional 1 to 3 inches of rain today could lead
to an abundance of water runoff and swollen rivers/streams. WPC
has issued a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall that extends
along the I-20 corridor in Texas, roughly from Abilene to Dallas.
Severe weather is also a concern, particularly over southwest
Texas and far southeast New Mexico. SPC has issued a slight risk
of severe thunderstorms across this region, with damaging wind
gusts, isolated tornadoes, and large hail possible. Additional
rounds of thunderstorms are forecast on Tuesday as well, but
should be more scattered in nature and lead to less impacts.

Elsewhere, precipitation is expected to spread eastward into
Arkansas and Missouri on Tuesday before reaching parts of the
Midwest and Ohio Valley early on Wednesday. A few storms may turn
severe across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains,
with flash flooding also a possibility on Tuesday from southern
Missouri to central Texas.

High temperatures will remain on the cool side throughout the
central and eastern United States today, but a warming trend will
commence by the first day of June. A high pressure system building
in the western Atlantic will funnel tropical moisture and warmer
temperatures along the East Coast. High temperatures in the 70s
and 80s on Tuesday will be a far cry from the 40s and 50s
experienced this past weekend.

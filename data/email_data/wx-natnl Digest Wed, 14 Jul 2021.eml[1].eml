Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

The forecast remains on track with only slight adjustments needed
based on recent trends in observations and hi-res guidance. The
deepening surface low over the northern Great Basin coupled with
stronger mid-level flow sampled in morning soundings yield high
confidence in a swath of elevated conditions across the northern
Great Basin and into southwest WY. Localized critical conditions
remain possible, mainly along and north of the interstate 84/86
corridor within the Snake River Plain of southeast ID where winds
have already increased to 20-25 mph amid falling humidity and
clearing skies. Other forecast details expressed in the previous
discussion (below) remain valid.

..Moore.. 07/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge across the West will weaken slightly. Flow
aloft across the northern third of the CONUS will become nearly
zonal through the period. A low-amplitude shortwave trough in the
northern Rockies will bring potential for thunderstorms in the
region. It will also be followed by a weak surface boundary sagging
southward into the northern Great Basin. Mid-level moisture will
promote scattered to numerous thunderstorms within the Southwest as
well as the southern/central Great Basin. Most of that activity will
bring wetting rainfall.

...Northern Great Basin and southern Wyoming...
Dry and breezy conditions are expected from northwest Nevada into
southern Idaho and southern Wyoming. Strong surface heating will
drive a thermally induced pressure gradient in the northern Great
Basin. Winds will further be enhanced by moderate mid-level winds
mixing to the surface. RH will fall to 10-20%. Some locally critical
conditions are possible in the Snake River Plain and southwest
Wyoming, where the terrain will channel winds. Due to the
thunderstorm activity in the Great Basin and northern Rockies, some
portions of the elevated area may be impacted by outflow winds and
cloud debris. Though this would limit duration of elevated
conditions, confidence is low as to where this will occur.

...Northern Rockies...
Mid-level moisture moving north will be sufficient for thunderstorm
development along the Rockies ahead of the shortwave trough. Storms
will only initially be dry and will quickly become wetting as they
move east. Storms in Wyoming and Utah are expected to move quickly
enough that initial activity in areas where PWAT values are higher
will still bring potential for lightning ignitions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 13 2021

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be increased confidence regarding excessive he=
at
expanding across the north-central contiguous U.S. later in week-1 and
persisting into week-2, with parts of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi
Valley possibly experiencing maximum temperatures greater than 100 deg F on
multiple days. An active North American Monsoon circulation is forecast to
promote above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest. Downstream across the eastern U.S., frontal activity is predicte=
d
to
slowly shift southward into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valle=
y,
becoming a focus for increased chances for heavy rain across already satura=
ted
areas.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, Wed-Fri, Jul 21-23.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Basin, Northern a=
nd
Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Wed-Sat, Ju=
l
21-24.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western and north-central CON=
US,
Wed-Tue, Jul 21-27.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Southern Plains a=
nd
Lower Mississippi Valley, Wed-Thu, Jul 21-22.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal portions of California=
,
Wed-Fri, Jul 21-23.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JULY 16 - TUESDAY JULY 20:

z4KFPYS2hqw$

FOR WEDNESDAY JULY 21 - TUESDAY JULY 27: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles depict amplified ridging returning across the western CONUS late =
in
week-1 with positive mid-level height anomalies building across the
north-central CONUS. By day-8, the model ensemble means indicate 500-hPa
heights of 594-596 dm centered over the Rockies, with positive height
anomalies
greater than 120 meters along the Canadian border. This pattern translates
into
increased chances for excessive heat across portions of the western and
north-central CONUS. The greatest potential exists across portions of the
Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley where the ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast tools depict at least a 60% chance that maximum temperatures exc=
eed
the 85th climatological percentile early in week-2. Given the continued
excellent model agreement, a high risk for excessive heat is posted for the
Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on July 21-23. Triple digit
temperatures are possible across these highlighted areas, with some locatio=
ns
potentially challenging daily records. A moderate risk continues through Ju=
ly
24, and is highlighted over a broad area including parts of the Great Basin=
,
Northern and Central Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley
where the reforecast tools indicate some of these areas having at least a 4=
0%
chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th climatological percentile, whic=
h
translates to actual temperatures reaching into the 90s deg F across the
valleys of the Great Basin, and also over areas of the Upper Mississippi
Valley. A slight risk for excessive heat continues for all of week-2 for mu=
ch
of the western and north-central CONUS with the slight risk chances shiftin=
g
more east with time.



The predicted placement of the mid-level height maximum across the Rockies =
is
expected to promote enhanced monsoonal moisture flow across portions of the
Desert Southwest. Increased tropical activity in the Eastern Pacific may
contribute to enhanced moisture surges as well. Although actual precipitati=
on
amounts in the model guidance are not supportive of a heavy precipitation
hazard due to lack of coherency in terms of timing and placement, the
localized
convective nature of the precipitation could result in flash flooding acros=
s
the valleys. The highest risk remains across parts of Arizona and New Mexic=
o
where a flooding possible hazard remains posted. Flash flooding can occur e=
ven
in areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct result of runoff fro=
m
precipitation upstream.



Mean surface high pressure remains forecast across the northeastern Pacific=
,
into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while thermal low pressure is anticipa=
ted
over the Great Basin and Desert Southwest during week-2 related to the
aforementioned anomalous ridging predicted. The strong mean pressure gradie=
nt
situated over coastal California increases chances for episodic high winds =
in
the region, where both reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph during the
early
portion of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds remains posted
across
coastal portions of northern and central California for July 21-23. Increas=
ed
wind speeds could promote the spread of wildfires due to the ongoing hot an=
d
dry conditions.



Downstream of the ridge over the western CONUS, the overall mid-level flow
pattern is favored to be weaker with a slow moving front forecast to sag
southward toward the Gulf of Mexico coast by the start of week-2. This feat=
ure
is expected to become a focal point for heavy rainfall with the ECMWF
reforecast tool indicating at least a 20% chance that 3-day rainfall totals
exceed the 85th climatological percentile and 1 inch over parts of the
Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, where given the convective nature of t=
he
threat, locally higher rainfall amounts are possible. The strongest signal =
for
heavy rain in the uncalibrated 0z ECMWF ensemble guidance is on day-8 (July
21), with a weaker signal on day-9 (July 22). There is some agreement with =
the
uncalibrated 0z GEFS and Canadian ensembles as well, and as a result, a sli=
ght
risk for heavy precipitation is highlighted over parts of the Southern Plai=
ns
and Lower Mississippi Valley on July 21-22. The already saturated soils, an=
d
the resultant lower threshold for flash flooding, also supports the inclusi=
on
of this otherwise marginal threat.



A low amplitude pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with troughing =
in
the Bering Sea and associated surface low pressure favoring increased
precipitation chances across portions of the western Mainland early in the
period. While the chances of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th
percentile are greater than 20% in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools over
some areas, actual 3-day precipitation totals are forecast to be under an
inch,
precluding a related hazard. Generally seasonable temperatures are forecast
across the state, with a slight tilt toward above normal temperatures acros=
s
the eastern Mainland, and below normal temperatures across the western
Mainland.

...Heat expected to continue across the northern Great Basin to
the northern Plains...

...Overview...

Upper troughing settling into the Northeast will extend a front
southwestward into the central Plains but with uncertain details
regarding the speed and location of individual frontal waves.
These details will be important in placing the pre-frontal
rainfall axis, which may contain bouts of heavy rain and training
thunderstorms from the Ohio Valley early this weekend and then
further south and west early next week.  Meanwhile, high
temperatures in the 90s to triple digits ahead of an upper-level
trough edging into the Pacific Northwest.  Over the Southwest, the
Monsoon will help touch off some showers and storms around the
upper high across portions of AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed decent agreement on the the longwave
pattern evolution across the U.S. through the medium range but
continues to show noticeable uncertainty on predicting
if/where/when frontal waves will lift across the Northeast this
weekend.  This introduced more uncertainty than desired regarding
the pre-frontal heavy rain potential with the ECMWF being quite
robust in the QPF amounts.  Model differences are less significant
regarding the upper trough approaching the Pacific Northwest.  The
WPC medium-range package was derived based on the consensus of the
00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and a smaller
proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, trending toward their
ensemble means for Days 6-7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the northern Great Basin through Montana where high
temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and into the 100s this
weekend into early next week into early next week, which will be
10 to nearly 20 degrees above normal for this time of the year.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and
early evening. Below normal temperatures may also develop in the
southern high Plains as northerly flow advects cooler air aloft
across the area.

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be scattered to numerous, with locally heavier
amounts where thunderstorms locally train.  Temperatures will be
near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest
rainfall chances will slowly shift southward across the MS Valley,
TN Valley, Appalachians, and mid Atlantic to the southeast.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue July 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 19 - 23 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a weak ridge over =
the
Aleutians with above normal 500-hPa heights extending to Mainland Alaska, a=
nd
a
trough over the eastern North Pacific centered near the coast of western No=
rth
America. A ridge is predicted over the western and central CONUS with posit=
ive
height anomalies extending to the Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and Northea=
st.
Downstream a positively tilted trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS w=
ith
below normal 500-hPa heights from parts of the Southern Plains to the
Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic region.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated across eastern Mainland
Alaska underneath predicted above normal heights, while below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska, consistent w=
ith
the consolidation tool. Above normal temperatures are also favored for much=
 of
the western CONUS, the Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and parts of the
Northeast
due to the persistent ridging. A predicted trough over the eastern CONUS, a=
s
well as a weakness in the ridge over parts of the Southwest, favors enhance=
d
probabilities of near to below normal temperatures from the Southern Rockie=
s,
eastward to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic region.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of Mainland
Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and storm system development.
Below normal precipitation chances are increased over southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Below normal precipitation is favored for
much
of the northern CONUS due to positive height anomalies. The positively tilt=
ed
trough forecast in the eastern U.S. supports a more southerly storm track,
increasing the likelihood of above normal precipitation for the Southern
Plains
and Southeast, except for the Florida Peninsula, where below normal
precipitation is favored, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast to=
ol.
The position of the predicted 500-hPa trough and low-level flow is favorabl=
e
for increased monsoonal moisture and above normal precipitation in the
Southwest, extending into much of the Great Basin.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 21 - 27 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to shift eastward and deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. The
temperature probability forecast during the week-2 period is very similar t=
o
the 6-10 day period, with a couple of exceptions. Above normal temperature
probabilities are lower and cover less area in parts of Mainland Alaska due=
 to
increased uncertainty. Near normal temperatures are favored over the
Mid-Atlantic Region due to forecast eastward progression of a mean trough. =
The
precipitation probability forecast is also very similar to the 6-10 day
period,
though conditions are more favorable for monsoonal moisture to become a bit
more widespread, and conditions in the southeastern U.S. are expected to
become
drier, favoring less above normal precipitation.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday'=
s
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecas=
t
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

An elevated risk area was introduced for the eastern Cascades where
recent ensemble and deterministic guidance has trended towards a
more persistent signal for 15-20 mph winds. While these conditions
will remain localized, reports from ongoing fires in the region
indicate that any increase in wind speeds are resulting in active
fire behavior due to the very dry fuels. As such, wildfire spread is
possible tomorrow given the expected increase in winds.

...Wyoming...
Elevated conditions are possible tomorrow afternoon across southwest
WY where terrain-augmented winds and downslope warming/drying may
result in areas of 15-20 mph winds with 15-20% RH. This threat
currently appears to be localized, but may extend into far northwest
CO. Additionally, isolated thunderstorms may develop over western to
central WY during the afternoon hours. A moisture gradient across
the state may support an isolated dry thunderstorm or two, but
confidence in PWAT values and the coverage of dry thunderstorms is
too low to introduce a risk area at this time.

All other areas remain on track per the discussion below.

..Moore.. 07/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0213 AM CDT Tue Jul 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough in the northern Rockies will continue east into
the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes on Tuesday. In its wake,
shortwave ridging will develop in the Northwest. The weak boundary
in the northern Great Basin will remain stationary through the
period. A subtle shortwave trough may impact parts of western
Nevada, though there is some differences in the timing of this
feature evident in guidance. Strong heating in the Northwest and
northern Great Basin will promote another thermal pressure trough.

...Northwest Nevada...
A slightly deeper thermal pressure trough will develop as compared
to Monday. However, it is likely that mid-level winds will be
weaker. Should the shortwave trough be favorably timed, some flow
enhancement aloft would occur. For now, elevated highlights will be
kept in the lee of the Sierra given the uncertainty. Winds of 15-20
mph are likely with 10-20% RH.

...Cascade Gaps...
Dry conditions are expected within the Columbia Basin into eastern
Oregon. Winds, though, will generally be light. Fire weather
concerns are possible in the Columbia Gorge and other gap regions as
the thermal pressure trough drives onshore flow during the afternoon
and evening. Locally elevated to near critical conditions may occur,
particularly in the Gorge. Due to the onshore winds, RH is expected
to increase. Duration of sustained elevated conditions is not
certain enough for highlights.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Wetting rainfall is generally expected again in the Southwest and
Great Basin. While some drier storms could occur in far northern
Nevada into southern/central Idaho, model signals for this outcome
are weak on account of the shortwave ridging aloft.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible for portions of
the Northeast and Lower Great Lakes this evening...

...Severe weather and scattered flash flooding to impact parts of
the Northern High Plains and Central Plains tonight, shifting into
the Midwest on Wednesday...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. through
Wednesday, while monsoonal moisture produces flash flood concerns
throughout the Southwest and southern Utah...

In typical mid-July fashion, the main weather stories across the
Lower 48 over the next few days include severe thunderstorms,
heavy rain, and excessive heat. Through tonight, areas of severe
weather and instances of flash flooding are possible for parts of
the Northeast, Lower Great Lakes, and into the Ohio Valley. A warm
and humid airmass south of a lifting warm front will fuel
thunderstorms capable of producing isolated tornadoes, damaging
wind gusts, large hail, and intense rainfall rates. The greatest
chance of seeing impacts associated with these thunderstorms this
evening will be found across Upstate New York and much of
Pennsylvania.

Meanwhile, an upper-level shortwave is expected to spark severe
thunderstorms across the Northern High Plains this evening, which
could impact parts of South Dakota and northern Nebraska
overnight. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk
(level 3/5) of severe weather from northeast Wyoming to southwest
South Dakota. Severe wind gusts and large hail are the main
concerns across this region. By Wednesday, the threat of severe
thunderstorms shift into the Midwest and Upper Great Lakes ahead
of an advancing cold front and strengthening area of low pressure.
SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk for severe weather on Wednesday
that includes the northern half of Iowa, southern Minnesota, and
central/southern Wisconsin. Flash flooding will also remain
possible as thunderstorms interact with an abundance of
atmospheric moisture, with over 3 inches of rain possible in
certain locations that experience multiple rounds of storms. The
aforementioned cold front and associated thunderstorms are
forecast to push into Michigan and the Middle Mississippi Valley
on Thursday.

For the West, monsoonal moisture is expected to continue producing
scattered showers and thunderstorms through Thursday over parts of
Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. Rainfall amounts in excess of 1
inch can produce flash flooding in particularly sensitive areas.
Flash Flood Watches have been issued. Heat will also remain a
concern throughout central California and the Intermountain West
before slightly cooler temperatures arrive on Thursday. Highs into
the upper-90s and low triple digits will be felt throughout the
region, including as far north as interior Washington and northern
Idaho on Wednesday. Above average temperatures are forecast to
shift into the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains by
Thursday. With ongoing heat for much of the West and widespread
extreme drought conditions in place, wildfires may be easier
ignited and more capable of spreading uncontrollably throughout
this part of the country.

...Heat expected to continue across the northern Great Basin to
the northern Plains...

...Overview...

Upper troughing settling into the Northeast will extend a front
southwestward into the central Plains but with uncertain details
regarding the speed and location of individual frontal waves.
These details will be important in placing the pre-frontal
rainfall axis, where bouts of heavy rain and training
thunderstorms across the Ohio Valley early this weekend and then
further south and west early next week.  Meanwhile, high
temperatures in the 90s to triple digits ahead of an upper-level
trough edging into the Pacific Northwest.  Over the Southwest, the
Monsoon will help touch off some showers and storms around the
upper high across portions of AZ/NM/CO.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed decent agreement on the the longwave
pattern evolution across the U.S. through the medium range but
continued to show noticeable uncertainty on predicting
if/where/when frontal waves will lift across the Northeast this
weekend.  This introduced more uncertainty than desired regarding
the pre-frontal heavy rain potential with the ECMWF being quite
robust in the QPF amounts.  Model differences are less significant
regarding the upper trough approaching the Pacific Northwest.  The
WPC medium-range package was derived based on the consensus of the
00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and a smaller
proportion from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, trending toward their
ensemble means for Days 6-7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, rising heights will maintain dry and warming
conditions for the northern Great Basin through the northern
Plains where high temperatures are forecast to be the 90s and into
the 100s this weekend into early next week into early next week,
which will be 10 to nearly 20 degrees above normal for this time
of the year.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/CO during the afternoon and
early evening. Below normal temperatures may also develop in the
southern high Plains as northerly flow advects cooler air aloft
across the area.

As the cold front moves out of the Midwest to the East, showers
and storms will be scattered to numerous, with locally heavier
amounts where thunderstorms locally train.  Temperatures will be
near to above normal ahead of the front by a few degrees, with
only a few to several degree drop in its wake. Areas of highest
rainfall chances will slowly shift southward across the MS Valley,
TN Valley, Appalachians, and mid Atlantic to the southeast.

Valid 12Z Sat Jul 17 2021 - 12Z Wed Jul 21 2021

...Heatwave expected to continue across the northern Great Basin
to the northern Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, a developing and persistent closed anticyclone from
the central Rockies with ridging towards the northern Plains will
lead to a heatwave across these regions. High temperatures are
forecast to be the 90s and into the lower 100s at lower elevations
this weekend into early next week, which will be 10 to nearly 20
degrees above normal.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO during the
afternoon and early evening. Below normal temperatures may also
develop in the southern high Plains as northerly flow advects
cooler air aloft across the area.

As the cold front moves slowly south down the MS Valley, OH
valley, central to southern Appalachians, mid Atlantic, and then
the southeast,showers and storms will be scattered to numerous,
with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms locally train.
High temperatures are forecast to be a few degrees below normal
early next week in the southeast due the clouds and showers in the
vicinity of the front, and modest cooling.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed decent agreement on the the longwave
pattern evolution across the U.S. through the medium range,
with persistent ridging in the interior west leading to downstream
trough in the eastern US. One source of uncertainty was predicting
where frontal waves will develop along the front from the Ohio
Valley to the Appalachians and Northeast this weekend.

This led to uncertainty regarding the rain potential with the
12-00z ECMWF showing bands of heavier QPF amounts north of the
front in the northeast.  The WPC medium-range package was derived
based on the consensus of the 00Z-12z ECMWF/12Z EC mean, and the
18Z GEFS mean.

...Heatwave expected to continue across the northern Great Basin
to the northern Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

In the West, a developing and persistent closed anticyclone from
the central Rockies with ridging towards the northern Plains will
lead to a heatwave across these regions. High temperatures are
forecast to be the 90s and into the lower 100s at lower elevations
this weekend into early next week, which will be 10 to nearly 20
degrees above normal.

Temperatures in the Southwest will be slightly below normal due to
increased cloud cover and higher rainfall chances. Showers and
storms will be scattered across AZ/NM/southern CO during the
afternoon and early evening. Below normal temperatures may also
develop in the southern high Plains as northerly flow advects
cooler air aloft across the area.

As the cold front moves slowly south down the MS Valley, OH
valley, central to southern Appalachians, mid Atlantic, and then
the southeast,showers and storms will be scattered to numerous,
with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms locally train.
High temperatures are forecast to be a few degrees below normal
early next week in the southeast due the clouds and showers in the
vicinity of the front, and modest cooling.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles showed decent agreement on the the longwave
pattern evolution across the U.S. through the medium range,
with persistent ridging in the interior west leading to downstream
trough in the eastern US. One source of uncertainty was predicting
where frontal waves will develop along the front from the Ohio
Valley to the Appalachians and Northeast this weekend.

This led to uncertainty regarding the rain potential with the
12-00z ECMWF showing bands of heavier QPF amounts north of the
front in the northeast.  The WPC medium-range package was derived
based on the consensus of the 00Z-12z ECMWF/12Z EC mean, and the
18Z GEFS mean.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1236 AM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough in the northern Rockies will continue east into
the northern Plains and upper Great Lakes today. In its wake,
shortwave ridging will develop in the northern Rockies. A subtle
shortwave trough may impact parts of western Nevada, though there is
some differences in the timing of this feature evident in guidance.
Strong heating in the Northwest and northern Great Basin will
promote another thermal pressure trough east of the Cascades and
Sierra.

...Northwest...
Elevated conditions are expected east of the Cascades in Washington.
The thermal pressure trough will combine with a modest increase in
mid-level winds as broad cyclonic flow develops near the coast to
promote 15-20 mph winds. RH is still a bit in question as the
increase in onshore flow will mean some RH recovery will occur.
However, 20-25% is a reasonable estimate for within and immediately
downstream of the Cascade gaps and Columbia Gorge. Farther into the
Columbia Basin, RH may fall as low as near 15%, but winds will also
be weaker.

Locally elevated conditions are also possible east of the Cascades
in Oregon. A slightly diminished surface pressure gradient as
compared to Washington suggests the duration of these conditions may
not be more than an hour or two.

...Northwest Nevada...
Strong heating will induce a thermal surface trough. Surface winds
during the afternoon and early evening will increase to 15-20 mph.
RH of 10-20% is possible. With continued uncertainty as to the
position of the subtle shortwave trough, how widespread
elevated-level wind speeds will be is questionable.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Confidence remains low in seeing adequate dry thunderstorm coverage
for highlights. Wetting storms are expected in the Southwest and
into most of the Great Basin. Weak convective signals exist in parts
of the northern Rockies, but shortwave ridging aloft is expected to
suppress convection in most of the region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0124 AM CDT Wed Jul 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level and surface patterns on Thursday will be similar to
Wednesday. Shortwave ridging aloft will shift slowly east into more
of the northern Plains. Cyclonic flow off the Northwest Coast will
also move more inland. Strong surface heating will again promote a
thermal pressure trough in the lee of the Cascades and the Sierra.
Mid-level moisture may make it farther north into the northern
Rockies as well.

...Cascade Gaps/Columbia Gorge...
With a similar atmospheric pattern in place, elevated conditions are
expected again in the lee of the Washington Cascades. Mid-level
winds will be somewhat more muted, but the surface gradient will be
similar. 15-20 mph winds are expected but will be more closely tied
to the terrain. With the onshore flow, RH recovery is a source of
uncertainty in the forecast. However, 20-25% in the immediate lee of
the terrain and 15-20% farther east is probable.

...Northwest Nevada...
Elevated conditions are anticipated in the lee of the Sierra by late
afternoon into early evening. 15-20 mph winds will coincide with
10-20% RH. Mid-level winds could be stronger than on Wednesday, but
this will again be tied to the timing of another shortwave trough.
Given that uncertainty, elevated highlights will continue to kept
near the terrain.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
With the potential for increased mid-level moisture in the northern
Rockies, there is some possibility that isolated thunderstorms could
develop in southwestern portions of Montana and perhaps adjacent
Idaho. Forecast soundings indicate that the atmospheric profile will
initially be quite dry. Without an obvious forcing mechanism outside
of the terrain, confidence remains low in whether storms will
initiate. Uncertainty in moisture quantity and timing precludes
highlights.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Central U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave across the western U.S. abates in intensity through
the end of the week...

The active summertime pattern of mainly afternoon/evening intense
thunderstorms with heavy downpours will continue to make weather
headlines through the middle of the week.  This especially holds
true for portions of the Upper Midwest, Central Plains, the Desert
Southwest, and the Florida Peninsula.  A slow moving frontal
boundary will meander across Kansas and Nebraska, and extending
northeastward to the northern Great Lakes, and this in combination
with multiple mid-upper level impulses will fuel additional rounds
of storms with high rainfall rates, and any storms that develop
will have the potential to produce severe weather and flash
flooding.

Afternoon and evening showers and storms are expected to be in
place across the Four Corners region each day, and especially
southern Arizona and western New Mexico, as the southwest monsoon
advects deeper moisture into this region.  Given relatively weak
steering flow aloft, many of these storms will likely be slow
moving and result in flash flooding for canyons, across burn
scars, and other vulnerable areas.  A Slight Risk for excessive
rainfall is in effect for parts of this region.

In the temperature department, the ongoing heat wave across much
of the western U.S. is abating across the Southwest as monsoonal
moisture increases, but noteworthy positive anomalies will still
exist across inland portions of the Pacific Northwest and Great
Basin through Thursday.  Overnight low temperatures are expected
to be above normal as well and across a greater portion of the
western U.S. compared to the daytime highs.  Hot and humid
conditions will also be present across much of the Eastern U.S.
through the end of the week before cooler weather arrives in time
for the weekend.

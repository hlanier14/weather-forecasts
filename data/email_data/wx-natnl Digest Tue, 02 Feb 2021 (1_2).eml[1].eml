Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0907 AM CST Mon Feb 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes are needed to the ongoing forecast. Morning guidance and
observations continue to show low fire weather potential for the
CONUS today. See the previous discussion below for details.

..Moore.. 02/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1221 AM CST Mon Feb 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Relatively quiescent fire-weather conditions remain likely across
the CONUS today.  In the wake of an appreciably strong cold front
over the northern Gulf of Mexico and coastal storm just off the
Mid-Atlantic, a cool and stable airmass will take hold across many
areas of the central and eastern U.S.  Weak surface troughing along
the lee of the Rockies will encourage a few surface wind gusts to 15
mph across eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle amidst
borderline elevated RH values (15-30%) and low ERCs.  Additionally,
onshore flow across the West and areas of precipitation will
mitigate fire-weather concerns in those areas.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1212 PM CST Mon Feb 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Transient/localized elevated
conditions are possible across the southeastern FL coast Tuesday
afternoon as winds increase to 15-20 mph. However, recent hi-res
ensemble guidance continues to show low probabilities for
sufficiently low RH over a substantial area. Additionally, MRMS
estimates show areas of light rain accumulation over the past 24
hours that may have mitigated finer fuels to some degree. As such,
no areas are introduced.

..Moore.. 02/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1222 AM CST Mon Feb 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Quiescent larger-scale fire-weather concerns are expected again on
D2/Tue.  A weak lee trough across the High Plains will encourage
localized areas of warming/drying in that area, though the weak
pressure gradient and lack of support for flow aloft will keep
surface winds relatively light.  Additionally, the recent wet
pattern will mitigate fuel readiness in many areas of the West.
Though fuels may be susceptible for fire starts in a few areas of
south Florida, models indicate that RH values will remain above
elevated thresholds in most areas as trajectories maintain an
onshore flow component from the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Midweek Southwest U.S. system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week followed by major arctic
outbreak over the central and eastern U.S. by the weekend...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
Aside from the 00Z UKMET, the rest of the deterministic guidance
showed very good agreement and clustering at the start of the
period such that the WPC blend was comprised mainly of the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS/00Z CMC for days 3-5. The 00Z UKMET was too
deep/progressive with the upper level as it works across the Great
Lakes. Other areas of uncertainty were across the Southwest where
a potential closed low pinches off as the longwave trough develops
over the CONUS. The ECMWF features this solution the most while
the GFS and CMC to some degree are a bit more progressive. The WPC
blend resulted in a compromise solution with some favoring toward
the ECMWF idea. In the big picture sense, all the deterministic
models and ensembles show a significant longwave trough over the
central CONUS by the end of the period which should allow for a
significant intrusion of Arctic air to overspread the northern
tier and portions of the east.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Upper troughing driving through the Southwest/Rockies will produce
a swath of terrain enhanced snows into Thursday. System ejection
into the Plains still offers additional northern stream trough
phasing uncertainties and a complex frontal structure, but suspect
that a deepening low will organize and lift to the Great Lakes
into Friday. Enhanced snows are expected near and to the north of
the main cyclone track from the windy Midwest/Great Lakes to the
Northeast. Upstream, expect a swath of heavy terrain snows are
forecast from the Northwest to the north-central Rockies late week
with a series of potent shortwaves that subsequently dig into an
emerging/amplified central U.S. upper trough position this
weekend. This will act to drive a frigid arctic airmass fully
southward through the central then eastern U.S.. Interaction with
a lingering wavy front trailing from the aforementioned lead
system over the East may favor Piedmont/coastal rains and inland
snows from the OH Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast, though
there is much uncertainty on any coastal storm from the
Mid-Atlantic to Northeast late in the weekend to early next week.

Temperature departures will reach 15-30F over the northern tier
and Great Lakes by day 5/6 and overspread the East Coast by day 7.
For portions of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest, readings
may not break 0. The much below normal temperatures will even
spread southward into portions of the Deep South and north Florida
where daytime high departures of 5-15F are possible.

...Midweek Southwest U.S. system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week followed by major arctic
outbreak over the central and eastern U.S. by the weekend...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
Aside from the 00Z UKMET, the rest of the deterministic guidance
showed very good agreement and clustering at the start of the
period such that the WPC blend was comprised mainly of the 00Z
ECMWF/06Z GFS/00Z CMC for days 3-5. The 00Z UKMET was too
deep/progressive with the upper level as it works across the Great
Lakes. Other areas of uncertainty were across the Southwest where
a potential closed low pinches off as the longwave trough develops
over the CONUS. The ECMWF features this solution the most while
the GFS and CMC to some degree are a bit more progressive. The WPC
blend resulted in a compromise solution with some favoring toward
the ECMWF idea. In the big picture sense, all the deterministic
models and ensembles show a significant longwave trough over the
central CONUS by the end of the period which should allow for a
significant intrusion of Arctic air to overspread the northern
tier and portions of the east.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Upper troughing driving through the Southwest/Rockies will produce
a swath of terrain enhanced snows into Thursday. System ejection
into the Plains still offers additional northern stream trough
phasing uncertainties and a complex frontal structure, but suspect
that a deepening low will organize and lift to the Great Lakes
into Friday. Enhanced snows are expected near and to the north of
the main cyclone track from the windy Midwest/Great Lakes to the
Northeast. Upstream, expect a swath of heavy terrain snows are
forecast from the Northwest to the north-central Rockies late week
with a series of potent shortwaves that subsequently dig into an
emerging/amplified central U.S. upper trough position this
weekend. This will act to drive a frigid arctic airmass fully
southward through the central then eastern U.S.. Interaction with
a lingering wavy front trailing from the aforementioned lead
system over the East may favor Piedmont/coastal rains and inland
snows from the OH Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast, though
there is much uncertainty on any coastal storm from the
Mid-Atlantic to Northeast late in the weekend to early next week.

Temperature departures will reach 15-30F over the northern tier
and Great Lakes by day 5/6 and overspread the East Coast by day 7.
For portions of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest, readings
may not break 0. The much below normal temperatures will even
spread southward into portions of the Deep South and north Florida
where daytime high departures of 5-15F are possible.

...Heavy snow over southern New England and northern Mid-Atlantic
will spread further inland through much of the Northeast through
Wednesday morning...

...More heavy rain and mountain snow moving into the West Coast
will penetrate inland across the Great Basin and into the Rockies
during the next couple of days...

...Wintry precipitation moving across the northern Plains Tuesday
night into Wednesday...

A low pressure system centered off the New Jersey coast continues
to rapidly deepen this Monday afternoon.  Areas from the northern
Mid-Atlantic to southern New England are feeling the escalating
impacts from this intensifying coastal storm.  Heavy snow,
increasingly strong and gusty northeasterly winds together with
increasing wave actions along the coast are expected to culminate
tonight as the storm is forecast to reach peak intensity.  The
snow bands near the coast is expected to spread further inland
tonight as some coastal communities will likely see the snow
changing over to rain.  For areas where precipitation stays as all
snow, the increasing winds could result in near blizzard
conditions due to blowing and drifting of the snow.  In addition,
this storm will be slow to depart as the main storm center becomes
nearly stationary off the southern New England coast while
expanding its influence across the Northeast.  The heaviest snow
is expected to envelop the interior Northeast on Tuesday while
lighter amounts of wintry precipitation is expected to continue
near the coast.  Many locations across the Northeast will see more
than a foot of snow with locally two feet possible as the storm
weakens slowly near the region.  Northern New England should
finally see the snow snow tapering off by Wednesday evening.

In the meantime, the active weather pattern in the eastern North
Pacific will bring another episode of widespread precipitation
across the western U.S. during the next couple of days.  The
Cascades, Sierra Nevada will once again be the prime locations for
seeing heavy snowfall while rain will be affecting the lower
elevations.  The precipitation will spread through the Great Basin
and Intermountain region on Tuesday before reaching the Rockies as
mountain snows on Wednesday.  Meanwhile, an arctic air mass
building up over western Canada will begin to move south into the
northern High Plains on Wednesday, bringing falling temperatures
into the region.  In contrast, much warmer than normal conditions
will expand across the southern Rockies and especially the central
and southern Plains ahead of a developing low pressure and frontal
system over the High Plains during the next couple of days.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon February 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 07 - 11 2021

Today's models are in very good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa pattern
across the forecast domain. A large amplitude ridge is forecast over the North
Pacific, while a downstream trough is expected to persist over much of the
east-central CONUS. Much above normal heights are expected over Davis Strait,
ahead of the large scale trough forecast over east-central North America.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the western Aleutians,
underneath anomalous ridging. Below normal temperatures are forecast for the
remainder of Alaska due to near surface flow from western Canada and also
underneath below 500-hPa heights predicted over the region. Probabilities of
below normal temperatures are enhanced for much of the CONUS underneath the
forecast below normal heights and consistent with dynamical forecast tools.
The
highest chances of below normal temperatures (exceeding 80% in some areas)
exist over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley.

Several storm systems forecast to be ejected from the trough over the Bering
Sea favor above normal precipitation for most of Mainland Alaska. However,
below normal precipitation is likely for part of southern Alaska, consistent
with dynamical forecast tools. Downstream of the large-amplitude ridge off the
West Coast of the CONUS, relatively dry conditions favor below normal
precipitation for most of the western CONUS. One or more shortwaves are
expected to intensify and travel through the central CONUS, moving eastward
and
spreading precipitation across parts of the Northern and Southern Plains. Near
to below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley southward to the Tennessee Valley and parts of the Southeast,
consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal precipitation probabilities
are slightly enhanced for parts of the Northeast and Florida Peninsula due to
the frontal activities over the regions during the period.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
excellent model agreement on a large-amplitude pattern over the domain and
relatively good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 09 - 15 2021

During the week-2 period, a strong ridge is forecast to remain in the
northeastern Pacific, with the northern extension of the ridge moving west to
extend over the eastern Bering Sea. Downstream, a de-amplified  mean trough is
forecast over much of the western CONUS and a weak ridge is predicted
downstream across the Southeast.

Anomalous ridging over the Bering Sea continues to favor above normal
temperatures for much of the Aleutians. Below normal temperatures are favored
for much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due to forecasted low-level
easterly flow from western Canada and also consistent with dynamical forecast
tools. Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced probabilities of
below
normal temperatures for much of the CONUS, except parts of the Southwest,
Southern Plains and the southern Florida Peninsula, where above normal
temperatures are favored, consistent with the Consolidation forecast tool.

As the forecast ridge builds west of Mainland Alaska, the storm track is
expected to lift further north than usual, favoring below normal precipitation
along south-central portions of the state. Below normal precipitation is
favored for the southwestern CONUS, consistent with dynamical forecast tools.
Arctic surface high pressure is forecast to progress south from Canada,
increasing the potential for upslope flow and associated above normal
precipitation across parts of the Northern High Plains. Above normal
precipitation is also likely for most of the Mississippi Valley due to
moisture
flow from the Gulf of Mexico. Below normal precipitation is favored for much
of
the Eastern Seaboard and Northeast, consistent with the consolidation forecast
tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement on the large-scale patterns, offset by model disagreements
among
the temperature and precipitation forecasts.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Areas of mid-level low pressure are predicted to form over parts of
mainland Alaska and the central and eastern portions of the lower 48 states
from the beginning to middle of week-2. This pattern is anticipated to support
surface high pressure extending south from the Arctic Ocean and western and
central Canada, allowing cold Arctic air to spill southward into parts of
Alaska, the Northwest, and many parts of the central and eastern Contiguous
U.S.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of mainland Alaska
north of the Alaska Range, Tue-Thu, Feb 9-11.

High risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Upper and
Middle Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, Tue, Feb 9.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Midwest,
Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Tue-Wed, Feb 9-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for many parts of the southern
and central CONUS and Northwest, Tue-Sat, Feb 9-13.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Northeast, Tue, Feb 9.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 04 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vliFOilGOp3nBDRRMe4Dm1AXW7zH5IIbpWSzjUDnOj_2YOVknSW7LsWdqpNTn2BDD9-Sz2W8$

FOR TUESDAY FEBRUARY 09 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 15: The main hazards concern for
today's outlook is the potential for widespread much below normal temperatures
across the U.S. for parts of week-2. Mid-level troughing is forecast to form
over mainland Alaska from the beginning to middle of the period, while
downstream troughing is anticipated to propagate across the central and
eastern
CONUS. This pattern supports strong surface high pressure sinking southward
from the Arctic, bringing anomalously cold temperatures into mainland Alaska
and the East-Central CONUS. There is relatively good agreement amongst the
ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicating a >20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile across a widespread portion
of eastern and central CONUS from the beginning to at least the middle of
week-2. A broad area is highlighted across the central and eastern CONUS for a
slight risk (>20% chance) of much below normal temperatures, Feb 9 to 13. A
moderate risk (>40%) of much below normal temperatures is posted across parts
of the Midwest, Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Feb 9 and
10,
and a smaller embedded area of high risk (>60%) is designated for parts of the
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes for Feb 9. Some of the
highlighted risk areas may experience minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 5th percentile, nearing record breaking cold temperatures. Areas of
risk
across the Midwest and Northeast could have minimum temperatures falling to
sub-zero (Deg F) values, while temperatures across the southern CONUS could
fall to sub-freezing which would be some of the coldest temperatures this
season.



The deterministic 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GFS, along with the ECMWF ensemble mean
indicates a surface low intensifying over the Canadian Maritimes early next
week, which could bring high winds to parts of the Northeast at the beginning
of the period. A slight risk of high winds is designated for parts of the
Northeast for Feb 9, where the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates >20% chance of
sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph. Sustained high
winds in combination with anticipated cold Arctic air would especially pose an
increased risk for dangerous low wind chill values across the Northeast.



The ushering in of cold Arctic air into parts of Alaska is anticipated to
bring
increased risk of widespread much below normal temperatures to the state.
There
is good agreement amongst the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicating an
increased risk of much below normal temperatures. A slight risk area is posted
for mainland Alaska north of the Alaska Range where the reforecast tools
indicate >20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile and -40 Deg F.



Surface high pressure is anticipated to build across mainland Alaska and the
Yukon, with the possibility of surface low pressure forming across the coast
of
the Alaska Panhandle at the beginning of week-2. This pattern could be
favorable for Taku winds, which could support high winds from Juneau to the
Copper River Basin at the beginning of the period. Detailed localized
forecasts
for this mesoscale feature can be monitored via the National Weather Service
forecasts at

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest medium range models and ensembles offer reasonably well
clustered mid-larger scale guidance. The upper pattern will
highlight an amplified ridge over the eastern Pacific/Alaska and
an amplified longwave trough over central North America. A series
shortwaves will dig to the lee of the ridge to reinforce the mean
trough position. This will allow for a significant intrusion of
Arctic air to overspread and hold a firm grip on much of the
central and eastern U.S.. Shortwave details often prove difficult
to pinpoint at medium range time scales, but offer multiple
opportunities to induce frontal waves and swaths of wintry
precipitation in the widespread cold airmass.

The WPC medium range product suite was accordingly derived from a
composite blend of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and a composite of latest 00 UTC model and ensemble
guidance still seems in line.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A deepening low will organize and lift to the Great Lakes into
Friday. Enhanced snows are expected near and to the north of the
main cyclone track from the windy Midwest/Great Lakes to the
Northeast. A wavy trailing front will focus some showers and
thunderstorms down along the east coast. Meanwhile upstream,
expect a swath of heavy terrain snows from the Northwest to the
north-central Rockies as a potent shortwaves digs over the region.
This energy and subsequent systems will dive into an amplified
central U.S. upper trough position this weekend into next week.
This will correspond with two main surges a frigid arctic airmass
fully southward through the central then eastern U.S.. Trough and
cold air reinforcement will interact with the lingering wavy front
over the Southeast/East to favor Piedmont/coastal rains and inland
snows from the OH Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast, though
there is much uncertainty with possible coastal storm development
from the Mid-Atlantic to Northeast late in the weekend to early
next week. Later period energy progression dug into the
south-central states early next week could emerge.

Temperature departures will reach 15-30F over the northern tier
and Great Lakes by day 5/6 and overspread the East Coast by day 7.
For portions of the northern Plains and Upper Midwest, readings
may not break 0. The much below normal temperatures will even
spread southward into portions of the Deep South and north Florida
where daytime high departures of 5-15F are possible.

...Major Arctic Outbreak for the Central and Eastern U.S...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest medium range models and ensembles offer reasonably well
clustered mid-larger scale guidance. The upper pattern will
highlight an amplified ridge over the eastern Pacific/Alaska and
an amplified longwave trough over central North America. A series
shortwaves will dig to the lee of the ridge to reinforce the mean
trough position. This will allow for a significant intrusion of
Arctic air to overspread and hold a firm grip on much of the
central and eastern U.S.. Shortwave details often prove difficult
to pinpoint at medium range time scales, but offer multiple
opportunities to induce frontal waves and swaths of wintry
precipitation in the widespread cold airmass.

The WPC medium range product suite was accordingly derived from a
composite blend of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and a composite of latest 00 UTC model and ensemble
guidance still seems in line.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A deepening low will organize and lift to the Great Lakes into
Friday. Enhanced snows are expected near and to the north of the
main cyclone track from the windy Midwest/Great Lakes to the
Northeast. A wavy trailing front will focus some showers and
thunderstorms down along the east coast. Meanwhile upstream,
expect a swath of heavy terrain snows from the Northwest to the
north-central Rockies as a potent shortwaves digs over the region.
This energy and subsequent systems will dive into an amplified
central U.S. upper trough position this weekend into next week and
produce periodic swaths of snows. This will correspond with two
main surges of a frigid arctic airmass with much below normal
temperatures with some record values fully southward through the
central then eastern U.S.. Trough and cold air reinforcement will
interact with the lingering wavy front over the Southeast/East to
favor Piedmont/coastal rains and inland snows from the OH
Valley/Appalachians to the Northeast, though there is much
uncertainty with possible coastal storm development from the
Mid-Atlantic to Northeast late in the weekend to early next week,
but the ingredients seem present. There is an emerging guidance
signal that later period energy progression dug into the base of
the mean upper trough early next week may offer potential for an
emerging system/inland precipitation signature out from the
south-central states that could offer a widespread threat of
overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A cool, relatively stable airmass will envelop much of the central
and eastern U.S. today in the wake of a strengthening coastal low
south/southeast of New England.  This synoptic pattern will result
in northwesterly flow across dry areas of Florida with minimum RH
values falling to around 35-40% amid relatively high ERCs.  A risk
of locally elevated fire-weather conditions will exist especially
across the eastern Peninsula this afternoon.

Elsewhere, a weak lee trough in the High Plains will allow for
locally dry and breezy conditions across west Texas and far eastern
New Mexico.  RH values should only fall into the 20-30% range,
however, with maximum surface winds in the 10-15 mph range.  These
conditions along with low ERCs should mitigate any widespread
fire-weather concerns.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CST Tue Feb 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will slide southeastward across the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys behind a departing system over the western
Atlantic.  Meanwhile, a surface low will strengthen over eastern
Colorado and western Kansas through the evening beneath increasing
flow aloft.  Very late in the forecast period (D2/Wed evening), high
pressure over Oregon will contribute to offshore flow increasing
across terrain-favored areas of southern California, though recent
precipitation will hinder the ability for ignitions due to moist
fuels.

...West Texas and southeastern New Mexico...
Surface flow will increase west of a trough oriented roughly along
the I-27 corridor in the Texas South Plains due to vertical mixing
and steepening pressure gradient processes.  Widespread areas of
20-25 mph wind speeds are likely.  The lowest RH values (around
15-20%), however, are expected across the TransPecos and vicinity,
which happens to coincide with areas of minimal precipitation over
the past couple weeks.  Despite only modest ERCs, a risk of fire
spread will exist due to the aforementioned atmospheric conditions.
An elevated delineation has been added to address this threat.
Farther north toward the Texas Panhandle, locally elevated
fire-weather conditions are expected where fuels are dry, although
areas of precipitation have occurred and RH values are expected to
be slightly higher.

...Central/south Florida...
Despite weakening surface flow (in tandem with high pressure
building into the area), the 03Z RAP indicates potential for areas
of sub-25% RH values to develop across much of central and eastern
Florida where fuels are dry in spots.  This will contribute to a
localized, elevated fire-weather threat despite wind speeds of
around 5-10 mph in most areas.  The threat is expected to be too
spotty to introduce an area, but will be monitored in later
outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1236 AM CST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly flow will remain in place across the CONUS as a
weak upper-level trough translates across the Midwest/East Coast
through the day. The upper-level cutoff low over Baja California is
forecast to meander closer to the southern CA coast over the next 24
hours. While this will help ease the offshore pressure gradient by
late this afternoon/evening, northeasterly downslope flow will
maintain a fire weather concern for coastal southern CA for at least
the first half of the day. Elsewhere, westerly downslope flow is
expected across the central High Plains and may result in localized
fire weather concerns.

...Southern California...
Early morning observations from the coastal foothills and mountains
show modest east/northeasterly flow, which is yielding poor
overnight RH recoveries. Humidity values in the upper teens and low
20s are forecast to fall into the upper single digits and low teens
by late morning/early afternoon as winds strengthen in response to a
tightening pressure gradient. Ensemble solutions suggest winds
between 15-25 mph are likely with gusts between 20-35 mph possible
(primarily within the higher terrain). Given antecedent dry
conditions across the region, elevated fire weather conditions are
expected and localized critical conditions are possible, especially
across Los Angeles/Ventura counties where both ensemble and
deterministic solutions continue to show the strongest wind signal.
A weakening pressure gradient this evening should begin to limit the
fire weather potential, though wind-prone locations may continue to
see elevated conditions into the overnight hours.

...Central High Plains...
Latest surface pressure observations and analyses show a surface low
deepening in the lee of the Canadian Rockies. This feature will
translate eastward across the Canadian Plains through the day,
establishing a broad pressure gradient across the northern and
central Plains. Resulting westerly winds across the greater CO/NE/KS
region are forecast to strengthen into the 15-20 mph range with
gusts up to 25 mph possible. Downslope effects off the central
Rockies may support areas of reduced RH into the 20-35% range and
periods of elevated fire weather conditions. However, confidence in
the coverage of RH near 20% remains too low to introduce a risk
area.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 AM EST Wed Dec 1 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 4 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 8 2021

...Overview...

A quasi-zonal flow pattern is expected to be in place to begin the
weekend across the northern tier states with a broad trough over
the Great Lakes and Northeast, and an upper ridge over the
Intermountain West with an upper low southwest of California.
There will likely be two organized storm systems to contend with
through the middle of next week, with the first tracking from the
Midwest to the Northeast through Monday, and the second one
tracking from the central Rockies to the Ohio Valley and Mid-South
by Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent agreement on Saturday
before more noticeable differences emerge by Monday, with the GFS
indicating a faster shortwave passing through the Pacific
Northwest compared to the model consensus, and slightly more
amplified with the trough over the Great Lakes.  By the end of the
forecast period, there is a bit of model spread with the upper low
over northwestern Mexico, but this is not expected to be impactful
in terms of sensible weather.  There are still timing and
amplitude differences with the second storm system crossing the
central U.S. by the middle of the week, and the ensemble means
provided a good starting point for placement.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend
through Sunday.  Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means whilst keeping some of the operational GFS and
ECMWF and some previous WPC continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rounds of light to moderate precipitation are forecast for the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast with a progressive storm track
over the region through Monday, with snow expected to be the main
precip type over the northern Great Lakes and northern New
England.  Moisture increasing ahead of the cold front is expected
to result in scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the
Deep South to the Ohio Valley over the weekend, but amounts are
not currently expected to be excessive.  A shortwave and cold
front reaching the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night and through
Monday is expected to result in another round of moderate to
locally heavy rain and mountain snows to western Washington and
Oregon, with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies
by Tuesday with heavy snow possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.  By the end
of the forecast period next Wednesday, additional showers and some
storms are likely to develop ahead of a second cold front crossing
the Mississippi River valley.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for early December
across most of the nation through early next week, with the
greatest positive anomalies expected for western High Plains on
Saturday where highs are forecast to be 15 to 20 degrees above
average.  Another episode of well above normal temperatures is
likely for parts of Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday ahead of the
next cold front.  On the other end of the spectrum, cold weather
is forecast to continue across the Northeast U.S. with highs
running up to 10 degrees below normal through the weekend with a
cold upper level trough overhead.  However, no major arctic
airmass intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad long-wave ridging is expected to become entrenched across the
western two-thirds of the CONUS through D2/Thursday. This will help
maintain dry, but relatively calm, conditions across the West.
Further east, an upper-level trough translating across the Eastern
U.S. will bring scattered rain chances along with breezy winds to
parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

...Southern California...
The upper-level cutoff low currently along the coast of Baja
California is expected to linger just off the southern CA coast
through early Thursday. This may continue to support
east/northeasterly flow over the coastal mountains, resulting in
pockets of breezy downslope winds and elevated fire weather
conditions. In general, this threat appears too spatially limited to
warrant a risk area, but trends will continue to be monitored.

...Southern High Plains...
A weak lee trough developing across the central High Plains Thursday
afternoon should support breezy westerly winds off the southern
Rockies and into eastern NM. Downslope warming/drying may result in
RH reductions into the low 20s and teens. With dry fuels already in
place, elevated fire weather conditions are possible. However, most
solutions hint at a relatively localized threat confined mainly the
lee side of terrain in eastern NM. Ensemble probabilities support
this idea, which precludes highlights at this time. If guidance
trends towards windier solutions then highlights may be introduced
in subsequent updates.

...Mid-Atlantic...
An upper-level wave and attendant surface low are forecast to
translate across New England/southeast Canada through the day
Thursday. Westerly pressure gradient winds will likely increase to
10-15 mph with stronger winds possible in the immediate lee of the
Blue Ridge Mountains. Most guidance suggest RH values in the coastal
plain will be slightly dry compared to seasonal normals, but
downslope warming/drying in the lee of the terrain might support
local RH reductions close to 30%. If this occurs, dry fuels (10-hour
fuel moisture values between 5-10%) may support a fire weather
concern. However, the potential for scattered rain showers and cloud
cover casts some uncertainty into this scenario. Trends will
continue to be monitored.

...Widespread record breaking temperatures likely from Northwest
into Great Plains through Thursday; Elevated Fire Weather Risk for
Southern California...

...Atmospheric river winds down over the Pacific Northwest today;
river flooding and isolated landslide risks remain...

...Light rain and snow showers over portions of the Great Lakes
and Northeast through midweek...

High pressure dominance in the West will contribute to a record
breaking start to our December with respect to temperatures. A
weak atmospheric river event will wind down over the Pacific
Northwest today, while a low pressure system produces another
round of rain and snow for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Central
Appalachians and Northeast over the next couple of days. It's safe
to say that most of the precipitation that will fall in the CONUS
over the next several days will be confined to the northern tier
of the country as much of the upper-level troughing pattern
continues across southern Canada. Rain and snow totals will remain
negligible over the next 48 hours with some upslope enhanced
amounts possible over the Adirondacks and Vermont/New Hampshire
mountains. Some rain shower activity may develop as far south as
the Ohio Valley and the Central Appalachians as a warm front lifts
through the region this afternoon. The approaching system
responsible for the weak atmospheric river even over the Pacific
Northwest will produce a few inches of rain today before losing
moisture transport into the region tonight. Temperatures be too
warm to support mountain snow from this event, but river flooding
and isolated landslide risks remain a threat due to recent
rainfall. Some scattered to isolated thunderstorm activity is
possible for south Texas on Friday.

The strengthening and expansion of an upper-level ridge into the
Rockies will contribute to the emergence of anomalous warmth for
much of the West today. Highs will be between 25-30 degrees above
average for much of the Northern/Central Plains leading to the
potential for widespread high temperature records being broken
over portions of the Northwest, Northern/Central Plains and much
of California while warm air begins to creep into the eastern
third of the country. The expansion of the ridge into the Great
Plains tonight will see night time low temperature records
potentially being broken across the Northern Rockies, down through
the Front Range and into the Northern/Central Plains. We'll see
our greatest chance for widespread high temperature records being
set this Thursday across the Central/Southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley where high temperatures could reach up to 40
degrees above average. Fortunately, this only means that
temperatures will peak in the 60s and 70s, so nothing too
uncomfortable is expected for folks in those parts of the country.
The Mid-Atlantic down to the southeast will reach their warmest
point of the week on Friday with highs in the 60s and 70s likely.
An exiting cold front will see temperatures drop in the Northeast
heading into the weekend. An Elevated Fire Weather risk area was
issued by the Storm Prediction Center for parts of southern
California as a cut-off low over Baja continues to increase
northeasterly winds and dry conditions into the area.

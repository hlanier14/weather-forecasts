Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-low will move to the southeast through the day across the
Ohio River Valley while mid-level ridging develops across the
central and western US. At the surface, a cold front will move east
of the Appalachians with numerous showers and thunderstorms expected
across the East Coast. Widespread fire weather conditions are not
expected, but locally elevated conditions are possible across
eastern Florida.

...Eastern Florida...
Ahead of the approaching cold front, gusty southwesterly winds of
10-15 mph are expected. With warm surface temperatures and RH near
40%, locally elevated to critical conditions will be possible given
receptive fuels. The lack of drier surface conditions owing to
precipitation potential later in the day will limit the risk of
greater fire weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Thu Mar 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
High pressure across the center of the CONUS will move little
through the period as an upper trough intensifies along the coast of
southern California. To the east, a cold front will move offshore
with a departing upper-level trough bringing cooler and wetter
conditions to much of the South and Mid Atlantic. Weak winds and
cooler temperatures across much of the country suggest widespread
elevated/critical fire weather conditions are not expected across
the CONUS through the period.

...Severe weather threat shifts into much of Southeast and into
the Mid-Atlantic region today...

...Heavy rain spreads eastward across the Appalachians into
southern New England tonight before ending as snow Friday
morning...

...Unsettled weather moving into the western U.S...

A dynamic low pressure system that brought widespread severe
weather yesterday across the Deep South will continue to track
eastward through the eastern U.S. today.  The threat of severe
weather will likewise shift eastward across much of  the Southeast
and into the Mid-Atlantic today ahead of a strong cold front.
Farther north, the center of the low pressure system will continue
to track eastward relatively quickly into the Mid-Atlantic region
tonight.  Meanwhile, a cold high pressure system from Canada will
build across the Great Lakes.  A swath of heavy rain is forecast
to expand eastward across the Midwest and Ohio Valley toward the
central Appalachians today north of the storm track.  But as the
cold air filter in from the north, the heavy rain is forecast to
change over to snow tonight across southern New England with
increasingly blustery northward winds.  Parts of the Mid-Atlantic
could see rain changing to a period of light snow Friday morning.
The entire system, and most of its impacts, should move off into
the Atlantic by Friday afternoon leaving behind windy conditions
in its wake along the East Coast by Friday evening.

Meanwhile, moisture ahead of the next low pressure system is
entering the West Coast.  This system will bring unsettled weather
into the western U.S. for the next couple of days. Temperatures
will cool down across the eastern half of the country, as the
storm system moves through. The Northern Plains will experience a
gradual warm-up heading into the weekend as a warm front lifts
through the region.

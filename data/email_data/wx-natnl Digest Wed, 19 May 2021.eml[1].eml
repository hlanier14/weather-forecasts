No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 05/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CDT Tue May 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a broad upper-level low
over the central Rockies that is expected to largely remain in place
through the day. This will allow for persistent, though weak, zonal
low to mid-level flow across the Southwest and maintain a surface
low currently residing over southwest Texas. Across the northern
CONUS, surface pressure falls along and ahead of a weak cold front
moving across the Canadian Prairies will allow for enough moisture
return to introduce isolated rain chances and increase RH above
critical thresholds across the Dakotas where conditions have been
dry.

...Southern New Mexico and Southwest Texas...
West to northwesterly flow across the Southwest will introduce areas
of downslope warming and drying across the broader region that may
introduce pockets of elevated fire weather conditions. Persistent
downslope flow has yielding dewpoints in the single digits to low
teens west of a surface low/dryline across southern NM and southwest
TX. Although mid and upper-level flow will be weak, 15-20 mph
surface winds appear are expected across this region and will likely
coincide with afternoon RH minimums near 15%. Given the dry fuels
across this area, elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to develop by mid
to late afternoon across northern AZ and NM this afternoon. Forecast
soundings indicated PWAT values will generally range between 0.4-0.6
inches over a dry boundary-layer, suggesting that a mixture of wet
and dry thunderstorms is possible. However, confidence in the
coverage of dry thunderstorms is fairly low, especially over AZ
where instability will likely be more limited as compared to Monday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
136 PM EDT Tue May 18 2021

Valid 12Z Fri May 21 2021 - 12Z Tue May 25 2021

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers into late
week...
...Southeast-Central U.S. Heat...
...Cold and Unsettled West with Northern Rockies Snows...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest model guidance offered above average predictability and
agreement for the early part of the medium range period (days 3-5;
Fri-Sun) with the more amplified flow pattern featuring a closed
low over the western U.S. and ridging anchored off the Southeast
U.S. coast. Over the course of the period, the western U.S. system
will fill and lift northeast as a shortwave while the Southeast
ridge settles over the Gulf Coast region. By early next week, the
guidance suggests another closed low dropping down British
Columbia coast toward the Pacific Northwest but model timing with
that feature is still uncertain.

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Fri-Sun)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS and
00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 13 UTC National Blend
of Models. For days 6-7, the GEFS and ECENS means were including
as the forecast spread increases. WPC continuity is well
maintained.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The CONUS amplified pattern as highlighted by troughing over the
West, with lead south-central Plains troughing blocked by an
amplified ridge out from the East. Ridge amplification offers
potential for much above normal temperatures for the Midwest and
the East. Some record high minimum and maximum values will be
possible, with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Amplified upper troughing over the West favors some moderate
precipitation for the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including an enhanced snow focus over the northern Rockies. This
occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F below normal
across the Intermountain West/northern Rockies.

The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to shift toward
the north-central states along a wavy stationary boundary.
Moisture and instability will be focused there and some of this
convective activity may spill into the Great Lakes region and
drive backdoor cold fronts over the Northeast into portions of the
Mid-Atlantic.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers into late
week...
...Southeast-Central U.S. Heat...
...Cold and Unsettled West with Northern Rockies Snows...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest model guidance offered above average predictability and
agreement for the early part of the medium range period (days 3-5;
Fri-Sun) with the more amplified flow pattern featuring a closed
low over the western U.S. and ridging anchored off the Southeast
U.S. coast. Over the course of the period, the western U.S. system
will fill and lift northeast as a shortwave while the Southeast
ridge settles over the Gulf Coast region. By early next week, the
guidance suggests another closed low dropping down British
Columbia coast toward the Pacific Northwest but model timing with
that feature is still uncertain.

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Fri-Sun)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 06 UTC GFS and
00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 13 UTC National Blend
of Models. For days 6-7, the GEFS and ECENS means were including
as the forecast spread increases. WPC continuity is well
maintained.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The CONUS amplified pattern as highlighted by troughing over the
West, with lead south-central Plains troughing blocked by an
amplified ridge out from the East. Ridge amplification offers
potential for much above normal temperatures for the Midwest and
the East. Some record high minimum and maximum values will be
possible, with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Amplified upper troughing over the West favors some moderate
precipitation for the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including an enhanced snow focus over the northern Rockies. This
occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F below normal
across the Intermountain West/northern Rockies.

The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to shift toward
the north-central states along a wavy stationary boundary.
Moisture and instability will be focused there and some of this
convective activity may spill into the Great Lakes region and
drive backdoor cold fronts over the Northeast into portions of the
Mid-Atlantic.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 18 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is potential for heavy rain throughout the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley as well as parts of the Midwest during Week-2. The warmest
temperatures of the season are also expected from the mid-Atlantic to northern
Florida. Otherwise, unremarkable weather is expected throughout Alaska and the
western half of the U.S.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation throughout much of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and Midwest, Wed-Tue, May 26-Jun 1.

Flooding possible for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and eastern Texas.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MAY 21 - TUESDAY MAY 25:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uypmhgGtSSIUO9G86zArVYq8yYLRSZ-MeLy0AYT55Kh-98sglz71hDuJICilBDGlE1fF_hNo$

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 26 - TUESDAY JUNE 01: A weak 500-hPa pattern over the CONUS
is expected during Week-2. Both the 00z ECMWF and 06z GEFS model runs forecast
anomalous ridging in the Gulf of Alaska and over the southeastern U.S., with
near-normal heights between those centers of action. Both models have similar
forecast patterns as yesterday, but the GEFS features slightly weaker height
anomalies over the Northeast. The expected temperature pattern closely follows
the predicted 500-hPa height field with anomalously warm temperatures forecast
in the southeastern U.S. and near to slightly below normal temperatures
throughout the West Coast and southern Alaska.



A surface low is expected to race across the middle Mississippi Valley and
Great Lakes during the middle of the week. The low's associated frontal
activity combined with southerly flow up through the Lower Mississippi Valley
could result in heavy, but short-lived, rainfall. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools suggest that there is a 20% chance of this area receiving at
least 1 inch of rain over several 3-day periods between May 26 - June 1. The
area of heaviest rainfall is centered over Missouri in the GEFS but reaches
further north and east into the Midwest in the ECMWF. Given this change from
yesterday, when both models centered the heaviest rainfall over Missouri, our
precipitation hazard has been expanded to better match the ECMWF's prediction.



Normally a 1.5-2 inch event over several days wouldn't be strong enough to
warrant an associated hazard, but we have included the hazard given the
potential for flash flooding as a result of heavy rainfall during Week-1. The
ECMWF ensemble mean rainfall for most of the indicated area is 1.5 inches
total
during Week-2. River flooding is likely during the next week across parts of
southern Oklahoma, eastern Texas, and the lower Mississippi Valley. A flooding
possible hazard is posted since minor to moderate river flooding may persist
into week-2.



Very warm temperatures, perhaps record-breaking in isolated areas, are likely
to persist from Week-1 into the beginning of Week-2 throughout parts of the
Southeast aided by a weak upper-level ridge and relatively low humidity. Daily
high temperatures from the DC region south to Atlanta are forecast to be in
the
90s Fahrenheit, perhaps near 100F in some places, at the beginning of Week-2.
However, dew points are expected to remain below 70F most of the time, which
will keep heat indices relatively low, while also helping the dry bulb
temperatures stay warm. Since model guidance continues to suggest that the
most
humid air will stay off the east coast, we have not posted associated hazards
at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 24 - 28 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  500-hPa trough over the Aleutians and anomalous
ridging over the Gulf of Alaska, extending through Mainland Alaska.
Downstream,
a trough is forecasted over the western CONUS, and enhanced ridging is
predicted over the central and eastern CONUS. Near to below normal heights are
forecast over much of the western CONUS, while above normal heights are
predicted underneath the ridging over the eastern two-thirds of CONUS and much
of Alaska.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alaska
associated with above normal heights. Troughing favors below normal
temperatures across the western CONUS. A broad ridge predicted over the
central
and eastern CONUS favors above normal temperatures for most of the eastern and
central CONUS, extending to the Southern Rockies. However, below normal
temperatures are favored over Southern Texas, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

Predicted surface low pressure leads to increased chances of above normal
precipitation for southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Mean surface
flow is forecast to become northeasterly from the Northern West Coast of the
CONUS, eastward to the Front Range of the Rockies, increasing chances of near
to below normal precipitation over the western CONUS, extending eastward to
the
southern Plains. Increased odds of above normal precipitation are indicated
across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains, the Great Lakes and
Middle Mississippi Valley, ahead of predicted mean troughing. The enhanced
ridging increases probabilities of below normal precipitation over the eastern
CONUS and the Lower Mississippi Valley.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset slightly by increasing
uncertainty in regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 26 - JUN 01, 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast to
be similar but less amplified compared to the 6-10 day period. A weakening
500-hPa trough is forecast across the western CONUS with near normal heights,
while ridging is forecast over most of the central and eastern CONUS with
above
normal heights.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across western
Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians associated with the troughing and associated enhanced
mid-level southerly flow. High latitude troughing favors below normal
temperatures across the Northern Plains and parts of the Northern Rockies.
Above normal heights over the Northern West Coast increase the probability of
above normal temperature there. Elevated chances of near to above normal
temperatures are forecast across most of the remainder of the CONUS associated
with ridging, consistent with temperature tools.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across Alaska due to
predicted storm systems. Surface anomalous northeasterly flow predicted across
the western CONUS elevates chances of near to below normal precipitation over
much of the western CONUS. Conversely, above normal precipitation is favored
over the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and the Ohio
and
Tennessee Valleys, related to potential storm systems and consistent with the
ERF consolidation forecast tool. Below normal precipitation is favored for
parts of the southeastern CONUS due to predicted ridging.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0254 PM CDT Tue May 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST NEVADA...SOUTHERN
UTAH...AND NORTHERN ARIZONA...

Expanded the elevated and critical areas southeastward. High
resolution guidance suggests 20 to 25 mph sustained winds may extend
across much of southern Utah and northern Arizona amid a tightening
surface pressure gradient. The strongest winds and driest conditions
are still expected in southern Nevada, northwest Arizona, and
southwest Utah.

..Bentley.. 05/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Tue May 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to deepen across the West over the
next 48 hours. As this occurs, surface pressure falls across the
inter-mountain West will strengthen low and mid-level winds across
much of the Great Basin. This will introduce elevated to critical
fire weather conditions across a region that has seen minimal
rainfall over the past two weeks. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
widespread rain chances and weak low-level flow will limit
additional fire weather threats.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
AHPS analyses suggest that most of the southern Great Basin and
northern AZ have seen almost no rainfall over the past two weeks.
The combination of little rain and slightly above normal
temperatures during this period have resulted in areas of receptive
fuels (10 and 100-hour fuel moisture values below 5% noted in recent
analyses). Strengthening pressure-gradient winds will increase to
near 20 mph by late afternoon and will likely be augmented by
frequent gusts up to 25-30 mph. Deep-boundary layer mixing and
minimal moisture return into the region will support RH reductions
into the 5-15% range. Critical fire weather conditions appear most
likely across southern NV into adjacent areas of southwest UT and
northwest AZ where the strongest mid-level winds are currently
expected, though transient critical conditions are possible in
peripheral areas.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Ensemble guidance and deterministic forecast soundings suggest that
a narrow corridor of dry thunderstorms is possible across northern
UT into western WY and western CO Wednesday afternoon. The approach
of the upper-level wave will act to cool temperatures aloft as well
as provide forcing for ascent across the region. Mid-level moisture
atop a deep, well-mixed boundary layer may support a mix of wet and
dry thunderstorms, though low confidence in the coverage of dry
thunderstorms and fuel readiness preclude any risk areas for this
outlook.

...Late-season snow is expected for the Cascades, Northern
Rockies, and higher elevations of the Intermountain West...

...Renewed fire danger is likely across the Central Great Basin
and Southwest...

Abundant moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to flow
into the central U.S. just ahead of an upper-level trough and its
associated energy, which should set the stage for persistent rain
and thunderstorms in the south-central U.S. over the next couple
of days. At the surface, a weak frontal system and outflows from
previous thunderstorms may help to provide convergent areas that
storms could form along. Additional rainfall of 3 to 6 inches is
forecast to be widespread across much of eastern Texas and into
western Louisiana through Thursday, with locally even higher
amounts possible. Flooding is already ongoing across portions of
this area, and this heavy rainfall will serve to exacerbate
flooding and flash flooding concerns. Moderate Risks of excessive
rainfall and Flash Flood Watches are in place. Severe weather is
also a possibility through tonight for much of Texas into the
Ark-La-Tex region, and tornadoes, high winds, and hail are all
possible under a Slight Risk of severe weather from the Storm
Prediction Center. Severe storms should mainly focus in South
Texas on Wednesday.

A deeper upper-level low is expected to gradually move into the
Northwest through Thursday, which will spread below average
temperatures to the area as well as precipitation as a cold front
pushes across. Another round of late-season snow is possible for
higher elevations of the West, with over a foot of snow forecast
for the Washington Cascades and the Northern Rockies through
Thursday. Other high elevation areas in the Northern Great Basin
into the Sierra Nevada could receive a few inches of snow. Rain
should spread into the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by
Wednesday ahead of the cold front. Additionally, severe
thunderstorms are a threat in northern/central portions of the
High Plains on Thursday after a renewed dryline develops. However,
south of the front and upper-level trough, dry conditions are
expected to continue. Fire danger is forecast to increase
Wednesday and Thursday for portions of the Central Great Basin
into the Southwest, where Critical Risks of fire danger are
delineated.

The eastern U.S. will see mainly dry conditions under high
pressure with only a few showers--though Florida could see
scattered showers and thunderstorms with high temperatures a few
degrees below normal. Meanwhile, the north-central and
northeastern U.S. are expected to warm to above normal by 10 to 20
degrees over the next couple of days, with temperatures in the 80s
in most places. The south-central U.S. should be slightly below
normal given the rain and cloudiness, while below normal
temperatures spread south and east underneath the trough in the
West. Freeze Warnings are in effect for Wednesday morning over
portions of northern Washington and Idaho.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers to
mid-late week...
...Developing heat for the East-Central U.S.; Cold/Unsettled with
high-elevation snow over the West/Rockies...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue the trend of establishing an
amplified upper-level pattern across the U.S. with a deep trough
moving into the western U.S. and a warm ridge building over the
eastern U.S.  Downstream from the deep upper trough, there
continues to be a general model trend for a faster northern stream
flow across the northern tier states into southeastern Canada.
Meanwhile, the strengthening of the deep-layer warm high in the
East will continue to keep the stream of Gulf moisture open for
the Plains states especially for eastern to southern Texas on
Friday, followed by a shift in the rain axis toward the southern
High Plains during the weekend.  There is also the tendency for
the rain to become more diurnally-driven with time.  Farther
north, the deep upper trough will keep a good chance of wet snow
for the higher elevation of the northern Rockies especially on
Thursday to Friday.  By early next week, models have recently
trended toward the formation of an occluded low over the northern
Plains as the upper trough exits the northern Rockies.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles still agree that upper flow pattern over the
lower 48 states will significantly amplify over the next few days.
The upper pattern will be highlighted into midweek by an emerging
digging trough into the West and troughing over the south-central
Plains increasingly blocked by an amplified and warming ridge
building out from the East. Ridge amplification into late this
week will coincide with substantial warming from the Midwest
towards and especially in the East where some record high minimum
and maximum values will be possible, with temperature anomalies
upwards to 10-20F above normal.

Meanwhile, an ongoing but transitional heavy rainfall event should
persist through mid-late week with continued but slowly
diminishing focus over the Southern Plains. WPC QPF shows this
trend, but blocky flow and deep pooled Gulf moisture suggests some
downpours may produce more hefty local amounts and runoff issues.

Digging of amplified upper troughing over the West will support
widespread moderate precipitation from the Pacific Northwest and
Sierra through the north-central Intermountain West/Rockies,
including some mountain enhanced snows to focus over the northern
Rockies. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West,
early week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the
Northwest through the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool
with pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage to result
in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

Downstream, ejecting western trough impulses and some energy lift
from the southern Plains will shear northward over the central
U.S. on the western periphery of an anchoring east-central ridge.
This conduit will support periods of enhanced convective rains as
moisture and instability are focused along a slow-moving and wavy
front across the north-central U.S.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0102 AM CDT Wed May 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is noted off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest in early-morning water vapor imagery. This feature is
expected to begin deepening along the West Coast over the next 24
hours, which will place a belt of strengthening mid and upper-level
winds over the southern Great Basin late this afternoon. At the
surface, pressure falls over the inter-mountain West will lead to
increasing winds and a heightened fire weather concern across the
southern Great Basin and portions of the Southwest. Elsewhere across
the county, scattered rain chances and weak winds will limit
additional concerns.

...Southern Great Basin and the Southwest...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions continue to appear
likely late this afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-25 mph
across portions of the southern Great Basin and Southwest region.
Deep boundary-layer mixing will aid in downward transfer of 850-700
mb winds as they gradually strengthen to 30-40 mph by 22-00 UTC.
Confidence remains generally high that the strongest mid-level flow,
and the greatest potential for sustained critical conditions, will
reside across southern NV into adjacent areas of southern UT and
northwest AZ (though transient critical conditions are possible in
the peripheral elevated risk area). Early-morning surface
observations show poor overnight RH recovery with humidity values in
the low teens to 20s noted. Diurnal warming and deep mixing will
likely yield RH values in the 5-15% range for most locations.
Minimal precipitation across this region over the past two weeks has
resulted in receptive fuels that will further support the fire
weather conditions.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Cooling temperatures aloft coupled with a modest influx of mid-level
moisture will likely support isolated to scattered convection across
northern UT into western CO and adjacent areas of WY as lift ahead
of the approaching wave overspreads the region this afternoon.
Limited instability above a deep, well-mixed boundary layer with
PWAT values between 0.4 to 0.6 inches will likely support a mixture
of wet and dry thunderstorms. Isolated dry convection appears
probable, but modest fuel readiness across northeastern parts of the
Great Basin precludes a risk area.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sat-Mon)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains troughing and an increasingly
localized threat for slow moving convection/heavy downpours will
gradually weaken this weekend into early next week, blocked by an
amplified downstream ridge. Ridge transition supports much above
normal temperatures from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast where some record high minimum and maximum values will
be possible with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

An amplified trough over the West this weekend favors some
moderate precipitation for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies to include some high elevation snows enhanced by
upslope. This occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F
below normal across the Intermountain West and Northern Rockies.
The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to increasingly
shift toward the north-central states into next week, with more
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill some activity over the
downstream ridge to the Midwest/Great Lakes and drive backdoor
cold fronts from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Upstream, less
certain upper troughing with modest amplitude/precipitation may
dig renewed over the Northwest/West early-mid next week.

6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains troughing and an increasingly
localized threat for slow moving convection/heavy downpours will
gradually weaken this weekend into early next week, blocked by an
amplified downstream ridge. Ridge transition supports much above
normal temperatures from the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast where some record high minimum and maximum values will
be possible with temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

An amplified trough over the West this weekend favors some
moderate precipitation for the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies to include some high elevation snows enhanced by
upslope. This occurs as post-frontal conditions cool to 10-20F
below normal across the Intermountain West and Northern Rockies.
The focus for precipitation episodes is expected to increasingly
shift toward the north-central states into next week, with more
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill some activity over the
downstream ridge to the Midwest/Great Lakes and drive backdoor
cold fronts from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic. Upstream, less
certain upper troughing with modest amplitude/precipitation may
dig renewed over the Northwest/West early-mid next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN INTO THE
FOUR CORNERS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is expected to continue deepening across
central to southern California through the day Thursday. This will
maintain a belt of strong mid and upper-level flow over southern
Nevada into the northern Four Corners region, and support further
deepening of a surface low over the central Rockies. As a result,
another day of heightened fire weather concerns is expected given
the antecedent dry conditions and increasing winds over the region.

...Southern Great Basin into the Four Corners...
Conditions are largely expected to remain dry across the southern
Great Basin through Thursday afternoon, which will help maintain
receptive fuels that are already in place. Across the eastern Great
Basin/northern Four Corner region, fuels are slightly less
receptive, and isolated to scattered rain chances Wednesday
afternoon may further mitigate fuel readiness. While this introduces
some uncertainty into fire weather threat for eastern UT and far
western CO, areas that do not see rainfall will likely undergo
drying through the day Thursday amid the warm and windy conditions.

An antecedent dry air mass will likely support another day of RH
reductions well below 15% for many locations. Surface winds between
20-30 mph are likely across the region as a surface low continues to
deepen to the north. Aloft, 35-45 mph mid-level winds are forecast
to gradually spread from southern NV into the northern Four Corners
through the day. Deep boundary-layer mixing will help realize these
winds at the surface by the mid to late afternoon hours.
Localized/transient critical wind speeds will be possible across
portions of southern AZ and western NM, but weaker flow aloft and a
greater displacement from the tighter surface pressure gradient
suggest lower potential for sustained critical conditions.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the
Central/Western Gulf Coast through Friday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the southern tip of Texas through Thursday morning...

...Late-season snow is expected for the Cascades, Northern
Rockies, and higher elevations of the Intermountain West...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire danger across the Great Basin
and Southwest...

Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will continue to flow
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley through Friday.
Upper-level energy over the Plains will trigger showers and
thunderstorms over the region through Friday.  The WPC has issued
a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the Central/Western
Gulf Coast through Friday.  The showers and thunderstorms will
produce heavy rain over the region producing numerous areas of
flash flooding.  Additionally, the heavy rain may cause many
streams and possibly larger rivers to flood. The SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the southern tip
of Texas through Thursday morning.  The main threats from the
severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes. On Thursday, the excessive
rainfall threat continues over parts of the Western/Central Gulf
Coast.

Meanwhile, the threat of severe thunderstorms moves northwestward
to parts of the Northern/Central High Plains on Thursday.  Aiding
in this shift is front becoming quasi-stationary from parts of the
Upper Midwest to the Southwest through Friday.  The boundary and
weak onshore flow will produce rain and higher elevation snow over
the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies through Friday.  A
developing upper-level low over the western portion of the country
aids in producing gusty winds and low relative humidity led to a
Critical Risk of fire weather over portions of the Great Basin
into the Southwest through Friday.

The eastern U.S. will see mainly dry conditions under high
pressure, with only a few showers and thunderstorms over parts of
Florida.  Temperatures will become above average as an upper-level
ridge develops east of the Mississippi Valley, with temperatures
in the 80s in most places.

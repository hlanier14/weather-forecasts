Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1045 AM CST Sun Dec 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS/OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLES AND EASTERN NEW MEXICO...

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments to
the outlying elevated area. Locally elevated fire weather conditions
may extend through parts of eastern KS where gusty southerly winds
and humidity of 30-35% may develop during the day. The elevated area
was expanded westward slightly to account for stronger terrain
enhanced winds across northeastern New Mexico and southern Colorado.
For additional information please see the prior discussion below.

..Lyons.. 12/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0121 AM CST Sun Dec 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central U.S. as a
mid-level trough amplifies while impinging on the interior West. At
the surface, lee troughing will commence across the High Plains this
afternoon, with a surface low becoming established in the vicinity
of the Colorado Front Range. Downslope flow along the lee of the
Rockies and dry southwesterly gradient winds will foster
wildfire-spread conditions across portions of the southern High
Plains toward the central Plains through the afternoon/evening
hours.

Guidance consensus continues to show 20-25 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 10-20 percent RH by
afternoon peak heating across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles,
where fuels are receptive to fire spread and Critical highlights
remain in place. Farther northeast into central Kansas/Oklahoma, RH
will drop to 20 percent in several locales, with sustained southerly
winds peaking in the 15-20 mph range, warranting the maintenance of
Elevated highlights. The Elevated area has also been expanded
northwestward into eastern Colorado. Here, surface winds may be
weaker compared to points farther south and east. However, RH is
expected to drop into the 10-15 percent range for several hours,
atop fuels that are critically receptive to fire spread,
compensating for the lack of a stronger surface wind field.

...There are Slight Risks of Excessive Rainfall over parts of
central then southern California through Tuesday...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and
Northern Rockies...

...Critical Fire Weather risk for parts of the Southern High
Plains; cooldown in the West while central U.S. warms up...

Upper level energy will generate significant rainfall leading to
flash flooding and heavy mountain snow for portions of the West
coast over the next couple of days. A slow moving low pressure
system will continue to spread moisture in the form of low
elevation rain and high elevation snow along a cold front moving
from the Northwest down and into the Southwest over the next
couple of days. Heavy rainfall over the central California coast
may lead to flash flooding over susceptible surfaces tonight. A
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect. Heavy snow is
likely over portions of the Northern Rockies and Sierra, while the
Cascades and Olympics will receive light to moderate amounts
through Monday morning. Rain and snow amounts will ramp up as the
upper low amplifies and the associated surface cold front pushes
south through California and the Great Basin into Tuesday. With
this, the excessive rainfall threat will expand into southern
California where a few inches may cause significant flash
flooding. Between 2-4 feet of additional snow is forecast to fall
over parts of the Sierra with isolated areas possibly receiving
more. Two day snow totals over portions of the Sierra could easily
eclipse 6 feet. Light to moderate snow will also continue over
parts of Oregon and the Northern Rockies while spreading over
northwestern Nevada. The West will cool down significantly on the
backside of this system, with temperatures dropping 15-20 degrees
below average for much of the Central Great Basin and California.

Elsewhere, ridging over the east and the impending West coast
system will contribute to soaring temperatures over the Great
Plains and Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley through midweek. High
temperatures over the Central Plains will soar into the upper 60s
and 70s on Tuesday which will be 20-25 degrees above average. Lows
over the Central/Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley on Tuesday
night will drop slightly into the 50s and 60s which will represent
a 30+ degree departure from climatology. This will lead to the
potential for records to be broken over those areas. The Storm
Prediction Center's Fire weather risk continues for parts of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle tonight due to 20-25 mph surface winds
and low humidity.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance clustering and forecast spread/predictability through
medium range remains better than normal for the majority of the
synoptic systems of concern.  Nevertheless, the CMC and CMC mean
have been taking the next Pacific system on a track farther north
toward the Pacific Northwest than the GFS and the more recent
ECMWF runs.  The most recent (12Z) GFS and the ECMWF runs nudged
the low track farther north though.  By next weekend, models show
some spread on how amplified the upper trough associated with this
system will get as it dips near the southwestern border of the
U.S.  Meanwhile, models are showing better agreement/definition on
a frontal wave to develop quickly near/south of the Great Lakes
next weekend and then track rapidly during next weekend.

The WPC medium range forecast products were based on a blend of
40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS, 40% from the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and 20%
from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, with more weights toward the ensemble
mean starting on Day 6.  This blend yielded a solution quite
compatible with the previous WPC forecast package and seems well
supported by GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensembles.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A vigorous upper trough will lift northeastward from the Southwest
midweek, bringing widespread mountain snow/rain through the Great
Basin and northern/central Rockies. As the system lifts through
the Plains Wed-Thu, rapid cyclogenesis across the north-central
U.S. will lead to an expansive area of strong winds, together with
a swath of rain/snow through the north side of the low track from
the northern Plains and upper Midwest to the upper Great Lakes.
Ahead of the deep cyclone, an upper ridge will build over the
central U.S. where anomalous warmth will be most pronounced
midweek with record high temperatures upwards to 30-40F above
normal.  Modest lead rains that should fall on top of recent upper
Midwest snows together with the record warmth could lead to
flooding issues on Wednesday.  Anomalous warmth ahead of the cold
front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F, will reach the
East late week.  The trailing portion of the front will likely
stall across the Deep South late this week, with an axis of
enhanced rainfall forecast to set up from the southern Plains
through the Mid-South/OH Valley.  A frontal wave developing
near/south of the Great Lakes by next weekend should bring a swath
of wintry precipitation most likely across northern New England.
Meanwhile, the rainfall axis across the South will tend to push
southward toward the Gulf Coast region during the weekend as a
high pressure system builds across the Plains toward the East
Coast.

Upstream on the heels of the aforementioned lead storm, another
moisture surge accompanied with moderate to heavy precipitation is
forecast to reach northern California and Oregon Wed/Thu ahead of
the next Pacific system despite some uncertainty with the low
track.  Models show general agreement that this system will
gradually weaken as it gradually dips into southern California by
Friday.  By next weekend, guidance signal is also growing that
moisture from yet another Pacific system will modestly impact the
Pacific Northwest.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 PM CST Sun Dec 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments
based on the newest forecast guidance. Locally critical fire weather
conditions may develop for a few hours across portions of eastern NM
late Monday. However, spatial and temporal coverage will likely
remain low. See the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 12/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Sun Dec 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will persist across the Southeast as a slowly
eastward-moving upper trough continues to deepen across the western
CONUS tomorrow/Monday. Surface lee troughing will remain in place
across the High Plains, promoting dry and breezy conditions that are
at least modestly conducive to wildfire spread. Elevated highlights
have been introduced where 15+ mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds are most likely to overlap with 15-20 percent RH, and where
fuels are receptive to fire spread. While the more favorable
overlapping winds/RH are expected to be more localized across
southeast Colorado, Elevated highlights have been included along the
Front Range given the presence of critically dry fuels.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun December 12 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
144 AM EST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 16 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 20 2021

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering remains better than normal
for the majority of the systems of concern through medium range
time scales. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Days 3-5 (Thu-Sat). Added into the mix the compatable 18
UTC GEFS mean and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean Days 6/7 amid
gradually growing system variance to maintain max WPC product
continuity. 00 UTC guidance seems consistent.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A potent upper trough will lift northeastward through the
north-central U.S. Thu and cyclogenesis will lead to an expansive
area of strong winds together along with a swath of snow on the
north side of the low track over the Upper Midwest and upper Great
Lakes. Southeast of the deep low track, upper ridging will support
some record warm temperatures ahead of the cold front, with
positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting from the
east-central U.S. to the East Thu-Sat. The trailing portion of the
front will meanwhile stall across the South, with an axis of
enhanced rainfall and potential of local runoff issues from the
southern Plains through the Mid-South/OH Valley with return flow.
A developing frontal wave may also bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the OH Valley states through northern New
England into the weekend as the enhanced rainfall axis drops
southward across the South as cooling high pressure builds across
the Plains and to the East.

Upstream, a moisture surge with moderate precipitation will work
into California and across the Northwest Thu ahead of an
approaching Pacific system. This system will gradually weaken into
Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system may then modestly
impact the Pacific Northwest Fri into the weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering remains better than normal
for the majority of the systems of concern through medium range
time scales. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Days 3-5 (Thu-Sat). Added into the mix the compatable 18
UTC GEFS mean and 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean Days 6/7 amid
gradually growing system variance to maintain max WPC product
continuity. 00 UTC guidance seems consistent.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A potent upper trough will lift northeastward through the
north-central U.S. Thu and cyclogenesis will lead to an expansive
area of strong winds together along with a swath of snow on the
north side of the low track over the Upper Midwest and upper Great
Lakes. Southeast of the deep low track, upper ridging will support
some record warm temperatures ahead of the cold front, with
positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting from the
east-central U.S. to the East Thu-Sat. The trailing portion of the
front will meanwhile stall across the South, with an axis of
enhanced rainfall and potential of local runoff issues from the
southern Plains through the Mid-South/OH Valley with return flow.
A developing frontal wave may also bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the OH Valley states through northern New
England into the weekend as the enhanced rainfall axis drops

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 AM CST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface lee troughing will increase across the central and southern
High Plains as a mid-level trough approaches from the west today.
Modestly dry and breezy surface conditions are expected across the
southern High Plains by afternoon peak heating. 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds will overspread near-critical to
critically dry fuels from the Colorado Front Range to eastern New
Mexico/Texas Panhandle. Some questions remain in terms of how low
surface RH will drop by afternoon peak heating. Enough guidance
members depict widespread 20 percent RH coinciding with the stronger
winds, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights, though
low-end Elevated conditions are expected where RH struggles to drop
to 20 percent.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN PARTS OF THE OKLAHOMA AND
TEXAS PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
Strong, dry southwesterly surface flow will occur across the
southern Great Plains tomorrow/Tuesday, as a surface low rapidly
intensifies across southeast Wyoming with the approach of a vigorous
mid-level trough. Guidance consensus shows widespread 20-25 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds overspreading a critically dry
fuel bed from eastern Colorado down to the New Mexico/Texas border.
RH will struggle to drop into the 15-20 percent range during the
afternoon. Nonetheless, enough confidence exists to introduce
low-end Critical highlights across eastern portions of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where RH is expected to dip into the
15-20 percent range, with several hours of strong southwesterly
surface winds atop critically dry fuels compensating to support a
wildfire-spread threat.

...There is a Moderate of excessive rainfall over parts of Central
California through Tuesday morning; There is a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of Southern California on Tuesday
into Wednesday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and
Northern Rockies...

...Elevated Fire Weather risk for parts of the Southern High
Plains...

Upper-level energy and a plume of moisture will impact the weather
over the West Coast, with a developing upper-level low beginning
to move onshore over the Pacific Northwest overnight Monday into
Tuesday. A plume of moisture will move southward along the
California Coast to Southern California and move into Mexico
overnight Tuesday into Wednesday.

The moisture will produce coastal rain and higher elevation snow
over the Pacific Northwest and Northern/Central California and
snow extending eastward to the Northern Rockies through Tuesday.
The rain and snow will expand into Southern California on Monday
evening. The rain will be heavy. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Central
California through Tuesday morning. The heavy rain will create
numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may
flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Tuesday morning.

The heavy snow will be a long-duration event over the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Northern Rockies. The snow will
result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.
Furthermore, as the upper-level low begins to move onshore, the
snow levels will drop down to sea level over parts of the Pacific
Northwest and down to the surface over parts of Northern
California overnight Monday into Tuesday morning.

On Tuesday, the rain and higher elevation snow will end over
pockets of the Pacific Northwest and Northern California while
continuing over Central and Southern California.  Similarly, the
rain will be heavy at times over the Southern California Coast.
Likewise, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of Southern California from Tuesday into Wednesday
morning. Correspondingly, the associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable. Overnight Tuesday, as the
moisture moves into Northern Mexico, the rain and higher elevation
snow will wane over Southern California. However, the lower
elevation rain and snow will move into parts of the Southwest and
deeper into the Great Basin.

High pressure over the Mid-Atlantic on Monday into Tuesday will
usher in warm temperatures over the Southern High Plains along
with gusty wind.  Therefore, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk
Fire Weather threat across much of the Texas panhandle Monday into
Tuesday due to warm temperatures, low humidity, and increased wind
(15-20mph). Along with the warmer temperatures, moisture will
start to stream northward over the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley extending as far north as the Great Lakes
overnight Tuesday. As a result, showers and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley by Tuesday. In addition, overnight Tuesday, rain will begin
to develop over parts of the Great Lakes and Western Ohio Valley.

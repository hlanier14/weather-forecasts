...Light snow possible in parts of the Great Lakes today and into
Monday...

...An organizing storm system off the East Coast to bring rain to
the Mid-Atlantic coast, snow and and icy wintry mix to parts of
the Northeast...

...Taste of early Spring in the northern and central Plains, high
winds possible in Montana...

The most unsettled weather in the continental U.S. to close out
the weekend and kickoff the upcoming work-week is across the Great
Lakes and along the East Coast. Today, a weak wave of low pressure
tracking through the Great Lakes will produce light snow
accumulations in the northern tier of the Great Lakes. Off the
Southeast coast, a new area of low pressure is forecast to form
along a quasi-stationary front off today. Spotty showers will be
common from central Florida on north to the Carolina coast today
into Monday. A wintry mix forming Sunday night into Monday could
lead to light ice accumulations in the North and South Carolina
Piedmont and foothills. As the storm begins to move north along
the coast tonight and into Monday, another area of icy wintry mix
may develop from the urban I-95 corridor in the northern
Mid-Atlantic to southern New England, just in time to potentially
foster treacherous driving conditions for the Monday evening rush
hour. The coastal low is set to deepen off the Mid-Atlantic coast
Monday night and track north and east, leading to a swath of snow
across central and eastern New England Monday night into Tuesday
morning. Interests in New England will want to keep an eye on the
forecast in the coming days with the best chances for snow totals
exceeding 4 inches in the state of Maine. The immediate coastal
areas are most likely to witness more rain than snow.

The remainder of the Lower 48 is expected to see mostly dry
conditions thanks to an expansive area of high pressure throughout
the West. Temperature-wise, parts of the northern and central
Plains get a taste of more March-like temperatures while
seasonally mild conditions persist along the West Coast.
Meanwhile, farther east, a bitterly cold Sunday morning in the
Northeast eventually warms to more seasonal levels by Monday. The
coldest temperature anomalies over the next couple days are
centered in the South where chilly daytime highs will be common.
To the northwest, an upper level disturbance tracking into western
Canada early Monday races south and east into the North Central
U.S. Monday afternoon. This trough will result in a resurgence in
strong winds across Montana, leading to the issuance of High Wind
Watches for parts of the state on Monday. Lastly, periods of rain
are possible in the Lower Rio Grande Valley Sunday night and
Monday but any potential flooding is not a concern across the
region at this time.

A strong upper-level trough will deepen as it digs along the West
Coast. An upper-level low in the northern Plains will move through
the upper Great Lakes region. In its wake, another substantial
surface high will build into the upper Missouri Valley. Cold air and
precipitation will greatly limit fire weather concerns across much
of the U.S. Marginally elevated conditions are possible in parts of
the Southwest where drought has kept fuels dry, but cloud cover and
slightly cooler temperatures are likely to keep RH too high for
significant fire weather concerns.

...Widespread record cold temperatures over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley through Tuesday followed by only gradual
moderation...

...Stormy pattern with wintry precipitation events from coast to
coast and late week heavy rainfall potential across parts of the
East...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

By the end of next week and weekend the models and ensembles are
still advertising a flattening trend for mean flow aloft across
the lower 48. This evolution would bring a drier period and more
moderate temperatures to areas east of the Rockies by the end of
the forecast, while primarily focusing rain/mountain snow from the
northern half of the West Coast into the Rockies. In the meantime
the prevailing pattern with an amplified mean trough over the
central U.S. will feature one ejecting system lifting through the
East on Tuesday, followed by upstream western energy digging into
the Plains/northern Mexico by Thursday and then progressing
through the eastern half of the country. The associated low
pressure/frontal system initially pushing through the West will
emerge from the Gulf and continue northeastward after midweek.
With widespread record cold air in place over the
Plains/Mississippi Valley as of Tuesday and only gradual
moderation expected thereafter, a widespread area of wintry
weather is likely to extend from the Southern Plains through the
Northeast.

Guidance is still in the process of resolving details for eastern
U.S. low pressure at the start of the period on Tuesday. Recent
trends have favored slower departure of a compact upper low over
southern Canada, diminishing the potential for the
stronger/westward eastern U.S. surface depiction seen in some
earlier ECMWF runs. The 00Z ECMWF still has some vestige of that
idea. On the other hand the GFS is on the faster side of the
envelope. The combination of trends and spread favor an average of
latest available models from the 00Z/06Z runs.

Meanwhile the models/means continue to be split over remaining
forecast details. The 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean continue to be faster
and stronger with leading Pacific shortwave energy that comes into
the West during the latter half of the week, ultimately flattening
western-central U.S. flow late in the period. Other guidance
suggests some degree of mean ridging ahead of a trailing consensus
shortwave expected to reach the West by early day 7 Saturday.
These differences result in the ECMWF/ECMWF mean being faster than
other solutions for the late week eastern system, with associated
differences in surface low track leading to meaningful spread for
areas of heaviest rainfall and most significant winter weather
impacts. Persistence of the guidance spread over the past day as
well as fairly modest predictability for these details from the
large scale mean flow perspective recommend maintaining an
intermediate solution within the current envelope. New 12Z ECMWF
trends seem to support this approach.

The day 5 model consensus is good for the front reaching the
Pacific Northwest on Thursday and then the model/mean blend begins
to tone down the less confident aspects of guidance as the front
heads inland and the next system arrives into the region by
Saturday.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The period starts with a surface low deepening as it exits the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Tuesday. The main threat for wintry
weather by this point will be across much of the Northeast, while
the heaviest rain farther south should be off the coast. Some
moderate rain should linger across Florida along the trailing
boundary on Tuesday.

The next system moving through the West on Tuesday will spread
rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest/northern
California southeastward through the Great Basin and the Rockies
into midweek, followed by increasing coverage and intensity of
precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley
into the East from Wednesday through Friday. The models continue
to show a signal for heavy precipitation from the lower
Mississippi Valley into much of the East. Moderate to heavy
rainfall is likely from the Gulf Coast through Tennessee
Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, with a broad area of winter weather
impacts on the northwest/northern side of the precipitation shield
from the ArkLaTex region northeastward into the Northeast. Also to
note, the Storm Prediction Center continues to mention severe
weather potential within the warm sector of this system (and the
preceding system), with details to be better resolved over the
coming days.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

In terms of temperatures, still anticipate a widespread area of
record lows/cold highs over the southern half to two-thirds of the
Plains and lower/mid Mississippi Valley through Tuesday, with
temperatures generally 30-45 degrees below normal. Although the
central U.S. will see moderating temperatures by mid-late week,
this may involve anomalies recovering to "only" 20-35F below
normal by Thursday before finally leaving just some pockets of
10-20F below normal readings by Saturday. Potential for daily
records will persist over southern areas through Thursday or early
Friday. Some of this cold air will extend in modified fashion
farther eastward but likely remain west of the Appalachians. Given
the less extreme anomalies over northern areas to start with, the
moderating trend over the Plains may be sufficient to yield
modestly above normal highs over parts of the Dakotas and vicinity
by next Saturday. Temperatures in the West will be near to
moderately below normal through midweek followed by a warming
trend, especially over the Southwest where highs may reach 5-10F
or so above normal by Friday-Saturday. Clouds/precipitation over
the Northwest late in the week/weekend should raise morning lows a
bit but keep highs slightly below normal. The extreme
Southeast/Florida will be the one area of persistent warmth
through early Friday, with morning lows in particular expected to
be well above normal. However below normal temperatures should
spread across the Sunshine State by later Friday/Saturday after
passage of the front anchored by the system affecting much of the
East.

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Southwest will continue to broaden
as it moves into the southern Plains on Sunday. High pressure will
continue to impact the Plains into the Midwest. As with Saturday,
cold temperatures and precipitation will significantly limit fire
weather concerns across much of the U.S. Some dry/windy conditions
are possible in the lower Colorado River Valley with strong flow
along the back side of the Southwestern trough. Though RH could fall
near 15% with 15-25 mph winds, limited fuel availability and
marginal fuel moisture should limit overall concern.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 13 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no

312 PM EST Sat Feb 13 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Feb 14 2021 - 00Z Tue Feb 16 2021

...Over 100 million Americans are currently under Winter Storm
Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, or Winter Weather Advisories as
coast-to-coast impactful winter weather is ongoing or forecast...

...Icy weather is ongoing across parts of the Mid-Atlantic,
continuing through tonight...

...Major winter storm currently affecting portions of the West
will spread heavy snow and significant ice accumulations to the
Plains eastward early next week...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland into next week...

An extensive Arctic high will continue to cause bitterly cold
temperatures across much of the CONUS through early next week, and
widespread winter weather is forecast along its periphery. First,
parts of the Eastern Seaboard are seeing precipitation today into
tonight, and sub-freezing temperatures support the precipitation
falling as freezing rain and sleet across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic. Ice Storm Warnings and Winter Storm Warnings are in
effect across northern North Carolina into much of Virginia, D.C.,
and parts of Maryland. Storm total freezing rain amounts could
accumulate to a quarter inch, with locally higher amounts of a
half inch possible. Accumulations of this magnitude will likely
lead to downed tree limbs and power outages, as well as dangerous
travel conditions. Meanwhile farther south, precipitation should
stay rain across the Southeast, but rain and thunderstorms could
be heavy across parts of Florida and southern Georgia. Marginal
Risks of severe weather and flash flooding are in place today,
with a Slight Risk of severe weather in place for portions of
Florida tomorrow, with warm conditions south of a stationary front.

In the West, snowy and icy conditions are ongoing as Pacific
moisture interacts with the cold air in place. Even the lower
elevations of the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle and
Portland, have seen snow with this event. Precipitation may wind
down there tonight before another low pressure system approaches
and moves through the West, leading to additional precipitation.
As the upper-level trough associated with the first wave of
precipitation drops southeastward through the Four Corners region,
it will combine with some Gulf of Mexico moisture to produce
widespread snow across parts of the Central/Southern Rockies and
Central/Southern Plains by Sunday, spreading into the Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys by Monday. Snow totals of several inches are
forecast across much of Oklahoma and into northern Texas. South
and east of the snow nearer to the Gulf Coast, an icy wintry mix
is expected. Significant freezing rain is a threat, and the
current forecast shows accumulations over a quarter of an inch
across central Louisiana and Mississippi. Snow and ice are then
forecast to track into the northeastern U.S. later Monday into
Tuesday.

Underneath the aforementioned Arctic surface high pressure system,
the bulk the country especially east of the Rockies will continue
to see dangerous and record-breaking cold into the first part of
next week. The north-central U.S. should once again see high
temperatures below 0F on Sunday, with single digit highs
stretching as far south as the Texas Panhandle. Low temperatures
are forecast to be as cold as -30 degrees in the Northern Plains
to Upper Midwest. Add in gusty winds and the result is
life-threatening wind chills between -30 to -60 in the
north-central CONUS. Wind Chill Advisories extend as far south as
the Southern Plains. Hundreds of daily low maximum and minimum
temperatures will be broken, with some February and even all-time
low temperature records in jeopardy.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 PM CST Sat Feb 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will impact the Southwest into the central
and southern Plains today. A substantial surface high pressure
system will continue to reinforce cold air east of the Divide. Fire
weather concerns will be minimal across a vast portion of the U.S.
Dry and windy conditions are possible in the lower Colorado River
Valley as a strong northwesterly mid-level jet moves overhead during
the afternoon. This, in combination with a weak surface trough to
the east will produce 15-25 mph winds with RH approaching 15-20%.
Sparse fuels will limit the threat to locally elevated concerns.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 PM CST Sat Feb 13 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For Monday, the southern Plains trough will shift to the east.
Upper-level flow across the West will become less amplified and more
broadly cyclonic. Though stronger flow aloft will continue across
parts of the Southwest, a fairly weak surface pattern will limit
winds in areas of low RH. Continued cold air and precipitation over
the remaining portions of the U.S. will once again keep fire weather
concerns minimal.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
118 AM EST Sun Feb 14 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 17 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 21 2021

...Well below normal temperatures expected to continue across much
of the central part of the nation into Friday...

...Stormy pattern with wintry precipitation events from coast to
coast and late week heavy rainfall potential across parts of the
East...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

By the end of next week and weekend the models and ensembles are
still advertising a flattening trend for mean flow aloft across
the lower 48. This evolution would bring a drier period and more
moderate temperatures to areas east of the Rockies by the end of
the forecast, while primarily focusing rain/mountain snow from the
northern half of the West Coast into the Rockies. In the meantime,
the prevailing pattern with an amplified mean trough over the
central U.S. will feature upstream western energy digging into the
Plains/northern Mexico by Thursday and then progressing through
the eastern half of the country. The associated low
pressure/frontal system will emerge from the Gulf and continue
northeastward after midweek. With record cold air in place over
the Plains/Mississippi Valley at the end of the short range period
and only gradual moderation expected thereafter, a widespread area
of wintry weather is likely to extend from the Southern Plains
through the Northeast.

The guidance has come into better agreement on the late week
eastern system, though the ECMWF continues to be just a hair
faster and stronger than the GFS/CMC. This results in a little
flatter western-central U.S. flow late in the period from the
ECMWF, while the GFS/CMC continue to suggest some degree of mean
ridging ahead of the next shortwave expected to arrive into the
Pacific Northwest by day 6/Saturday. Of course, even small
differences in the details like this would have more meaningful
impacts to exact areas of heaviest rainfall and/or more
significant winter weather. The WPC progs reflect a blend of the
deterministic solutions early in the period, with some increasing
contributions from the means beyond day 5 to mitigate detail
differences, especially with the next PacNW shortwave next
weekend. This approach maintains good continuity with the previous
shift.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Precipitation over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley
will be increasing in coverage by the start of the medium range
period, eventually reaching into the East by Thursday and Friday.
Moderate to heavy rainfall is likely from the Gulf Coast through
Tennessee Valley/southern Mid-Atlantic, with a broad area of
winter weather impacts on the northwest/northern side of the
precipitation shield from the ArkLaTex region northeastward into
the Northeast. Also to note, the Storm Prediction Center continues
to mention severe weather potential within the warm sector of this
system, with details to be better resolved over the coming days.

Behind this system, another couple fronts reaching the Northwest
between Thursday and Saturday should bring the potential for
additional focused rainfall along coastal portions of
Washington/Oregon with heavy mountain snows in the
Washington/Oregon Cascades and northern Rockies. Meaningful
rain/high elevation snow may extend into parts of northern
California as well.

In terms of temperatures, widespread record cold at the end of the
short range period should begin moderating somewhat by Wednesday,
though widespread 20-40F below normal is still expected across the
central/southern Plains and the Mississippi Valley into Friday
with some potential for more daily records across southern areas.
Upper ridging should finally allow for some recovery of
temperatures back closer to normal by next weekend across this
region. Given the less extreme anomalies over northern areas to
start with, the moderating trend over the Plains may be sufficient
to yield modestly above normal highs over parts of the Dakotas and
vicinity by next Saturday. Temperatures in the West will be near
to moderately below normal through midweek followed by a warming
trend, especially over the Southwest where highs may reach 5-10F
or so above normal Friday-Sunday. The extreme Southeast/Florida
will be the one area of persistent warmth through early Friday,
with morning lows in particular expected to be well above normal.
However, below normal temperatures should spread across the
Sunshine State by later Friday/Saturday after passage of the front
anchored by the system affecting much of the East.

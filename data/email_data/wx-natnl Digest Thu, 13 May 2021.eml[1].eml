Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CDT Wed May 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The latest guidance consensus has trended slightly weaker with
surface winds across eastern North Dakota into extreme northwest
Minnesota for the afternoon period. Though the surface winds may
fall short of reaching Elevated criteria today, critically dry RH
and record dry fuels suggest that an appreciable threat for wildfire
spread remains, justifying the maintenance of the Elevated
delineation. Elsewhere, locally Elevated conditions are still
expected to periodically manifest across portions of the Southwest
through the afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 05/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Wed May 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
The surface pressure gradient is forecast to strengthen across the
northern Plains through the day today between an area of strong high
pressure in the Midwest and weak lee troughing in Montana. In
addition, a very dry airmass is in place across North Dakota
Minnesota with dewpoints in the teens to 20s F. This afternoon
relative humidity is expected to be around 20 to 25 percent. Winds
are forecast to peak near 15 mph. While this is only borderline
elevated criteria, record dry fuels and critically dry RH are
sufficient to support an elevated delineation.

Otherwise, some locally elevated conditions may be present in
northwesterly flow across the Southwest, but it will be too
localized to add any elevated delineation.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley early to middle of next week...

1830 UTC Update...

Not much has changed with the new 00z/06z guidance. The 00z ECMWF
has backed off a bit on such strong ridging over the East the
second half of the period, which brings it a little more in line
with other pieces of guidance. With that, there were really only
minor changes made to the previous forecast and so the thoughts
and details outlined in the discussion below still stand. The WPC
progs for this cycle favored a pure deterministic blend
(ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET) for days 3-5, with a majority blend towards
the ensemble means by day 7. Minority weighting of the ECMWF was
carried throughout the entire period just to lend some
deterministic details to the forecast.

Santorelli


Previous discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Thanks to recent trends in GFS runs toward the ongoing majority
consensus, today's guidance shows better agreement with the large
scale evolution during the period. Within a mean trough aloft
forecast to be established over the West, a leading trough/upper
low progressing from California through the Southwest or Great
Basin and then ejecting into the Plains should be followed by an
upstream trough that should reach the West by next Tuesday.
Meanwhile the combination of an initial Rockies/Plains ridge and a
faster moving southern Canada/northern tier U.S. ridge will likely
build into the East toward the middle of next week. The mean
evolution aloft along with a surface pattern that should promote a
multi-day feed of Gulf moisture will favor the best potential for
heavy rainfall over portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Weak shortwave energy filtering through the generally rising
heights aloft over the East may extend some areas of meaningful
rainfall into parts of the East. Also expect some precipitation
over portions of the Rockies while the second Pacific trough
should bring some rain and high elevation snow into the Northwest.
Double-digit temperature anomalies should be mostly of the warm
variety and are most likely from the Northwest into the northern
High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Over the past day the GFS has made significant progress in
adjusting its Pacific through North America pattern faster toward
other guidance. So instead of developing a Great Lakes closed low
from northern tier/southern Canada shortwave energy, the GFS is
weaker and waits until New England and the Canadian Maritimes to
show amplification--a more plausible scenario with latest CMC runs
and GEFS/ECMWF means also suggesting this possibility. However
there are still issues with this energy and possibly other weak
low-predictability shortwaves over the East, creating a lot of
latitude spread for rainfall/convective systems that may extend
eastward from the Midwest. Preference is for an intermediate
solution, between the more amplified GFS/GEFS and least amplified
(with strongest ridging) 12Z ECMWF. Farther west, guidance is
still waffling a bit with specifics of the trough/upper low
initially over California but the consensus timing appears to be
fairly consistent through at least Monday followed by typical
divergence with some dependence on upstream flow. As for the
second western trough, a blend approach represents the mean
pattern well while downplaying the more extreme details such as
the 12Z ECMWF developing more southeastward amplitude than most
other guidance by next Wednesday. Late the period the new 00Z
ECMWF compares better to the guidance average in both respects.
Based on guidance comparisons the starting blend incorporated a
composite of operational guidance for the weekend and then trended
toward 40-70 percent total input of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday as confidence in various model
specifics declined.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early in the period expect weak shortwave energy and a wavy front
to focus one area of rainfall over parts of the Central Plains and
Midwest while improving Gulf inflow will begin to increase
rainfall over the Southern Plains. Some of the activity over the
Midwest could eventually reach into the Ohio Valley/eastern states
as the focusing front and shortwave energy extend farther
eastward, though currently there is some uncertainty over the
precise latitude of this axis. Confidence is somewhat greater for
a multi-day threat of heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains and
parts of the Mississippi Valley through early-mid week as the low
level flow of Gulf moisture should persist and the initial western
U.S. upper system emerges into the Plains. Parts of this area have
seen much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks,
which may increase flooding concerns. Across the Rockies/High
Plains, there may be some enhancement of precipitation due to
potential for some easterly upslope flow along with the system
emerging from the West. In most cases any precipitation to the
west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered. Activity
reaching the Northwest late in the period may be somewhat better
organized but should still be on the lighter side of the spectrum.
Higher elevations may see some snow. The upper trough about to
depart from the East Coast may produce areas of mostly light
mid-late day rainfall from the northern Mid-Atlantic into the
Northeast during the weekend.

One or more days with highs of 10-15F or so above normal will
extend from the Northwest U.S. into the northern High Plains with
an upper ridge moving over the area and warm flow ahead of a
frontal system moving into the West. In contrast the system
crossing southern parts of the West should bring moderately below
normal highs to areas from the far southwestern U.S. into southern
High Plains. The Northwest should see highs drop to below normal
levels by next Tuesday-Wednesday behind the late-period front.
Meanwhile moderately cool temperatures over the eastern half of
the country during the weekend (though up to minus 10F or so
anomalies for morning lows over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Saturday) will moderate to yield
near-normal highs and somewhat above normal lows Monday-Wednesday.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley early to middle of next week...

1830 UTC Update...

Not much has changed with the new 00z/06z guidance. The 00z ECMWF
has backed off a bit on such strong ridging over the East the
second half of the period, which brings it a little more in line
with other pieces of guidance. With that, there were really only
minor changes made to the previous forecast and so the thoughts
and details outlined in the discussion below still stand. The WPC
progs for this cycle favored a pure deterministic blend
(ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET) for days 3-5, with a majority blend towards
the ensemble means by day 7. Minority weighting of the ECMWF was
carried throughout the entire period just to lend some
deterministic details to the forecast.

Santorelli


Previous discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Thanks to recent trends in GFS runs toward the ongoing majority
consensus, today's guidance shows better agreement with the large
scale evolution during the period. Within a mean trough aloft
forecast to be established over the West, a leading trough/upper
low progressing from California through the Southwest or Great
Basin and then ejecting into the Plains should be followed by an
upstream trough that should reach the West by next Tuesday.
Meanwhile the combination of an initial Rockies/Plains ridge and a
faster moving southern Canada/northern tier U.S. ridge will likely
build into the East toward the middle of next week. The mean
evolution aloft along with a surface pattern that should promote a
multi-day feed of Gulf moisture will favor the best potential for
heavy rainfall over portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Weak shortwave energy filtering through the generally rising
heights aloft over the East may extend some areas of meaningful
rainfall into parts of the East. Also expect some precipitation
over portions of the Rockies while the second Pacific trough
should bring some rain and high elevation snow into the Northwest.
Double-digit temperature anomalies should be mostly of the warm
variety and are most likely from the Northwest into the northern
High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Over the past day the GFS has made significant progress in
adjusting its Pacific through North America pattern faster toward
other guidance. So instead of developing a Great Lakes closed low
from northern tier/southern Canada shortwave energy, the GFS is
weaker and waits until New England and the Canadian Maritimes to
show amplification--a more plausible scenario with latest CMC runs
and GEFS/ECMWF means also suggesting this possibility. However
there are still issues with this energy and possibly other weak
low-predictability shortwaves over the East, creating a lot of
latitude spread for rainfall/convective systems that may extend
eastward from the Midwest. Preference is for an intermediate
solution, between the more amplified GFS/GEFS and least amplified
(with strongest ridging) 12Z ECMWF. Farther west, guidance is
still waffling a bit with specifics of the trough/upper low
initially over California but the consensus timing appears to be
fairly consistent through at least Monday followed by typical
divergence with some dependence on upstream flow. As for the
second western trough, a blend approach represents the mean
pattern well while downplaying the more extreme details such as
the 12Z ECMWF developing more southeastward amplitude than most
other guidance by next Wednesday. Late the period the new 00Z
ECMWF compares better to the guidance average in both respects.
Based on guidance comparisons the starting blend incorporated a
composite of operational guidance for the weekend and then trended
toward 40-70 percent total input of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday as confidence in various model
specifics declined.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early in the period expect weak shortwave energy and a wavy front
to focus one area of rainfall over parts of the Central Plains and
Midwest while improving Gulf inflow will begin to increase
rainfall over the Southern Plains. Some of the activity over the
Midwest could eventually reach into the Ohio Valley/eastern states
as the focusing front and shortwave energy extend farther
eastward, though currently there is some uncertainty over the
precise latitude of this axis. Confidence is somewhat greater for
a multi-day threat of heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains and
parts of the Mississippi Valley through early-mid week as the low
level flow of Gulf moisture should persist and the initial western
U.S. upper system emerges into the Plains. Parts of this area have
seen much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks,
which may increase flooding concerns. Across the Rockies/High

emerging from the West. In most cases any precipitation to the
west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered. Activity

organized but should still be on the lighter side of the spectrum.
Higher elevations may see some snow. The upper trough about to
depart from the East Coast may produce areas of mostly light
mid-late day rainfall from the northern Mid-Atlantic into the
Northeast during the weekend.

One or more days with highs of 10-15F or so above normal will
extend from the Northwest U.S. into the northern High Plains with
an upper ridge moving over the area and warm flow ahead of a
frontal system moving into the West. In contrast the system
crossing southern parts of the West should bring moderately below
normal highs to areas from the far southwestern U.S. into southern
High Plains. The Northwest should see highs drop to below normal
levels by next Tuesday-Wednesday behind the late-period front.
Meanwhile moderately cool temperatures over the eastern half of
the country during the weekend (though up to minus 10F or so
anomalies for morning lows over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Saturday) will moderate to yield
near-normal highs and somewhat above normal lows Monday-Wednesday.

300 PM EDT May 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of the forecast period an advancing cold front i=
s
likely to interact with moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, potentially bring=
ing
heavy rain to portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. In gener=
al,
models favor a more amplified mid-level pattern at the beginning of the
period,
with mid-level high (low) pressure across the eastern (western) half of the
lower 48. The mid-level pattern is anticipated to gradually deamplify
throughout week-2, transitioning to weak mid-level high pressure across the
eastern two-thirds of the contiguous U.S. and mid-level low pressure across
the
western third. There is significantly more model uncertainty for Alaska, wi=
th
models generally indicating a transition from mid-level low to high pressur=
e
across much of the state, although there are noticeable timing differences.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Southern and Central Plain=
s
and the Lower Mississippi Valley, Thu, May 20.

Possible flooding for parts of eastern Texas.

FOR THURSDAY MAY 20 - WEDNESDAY MAY 26: A frontal boundary stretching acros=
s
the southeastern quadrant of the CONUS into the Southern Plains is anticipa=
ted
to continue from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2. This front=
,
combined with enhanced moisture from the Gulf of Mexico may bring heavy
rainfall to parts of the South-Central CONUS at the start of the period. A
slight risk of heavy rainfall is posted for day 8 only (May 20) since much =
of
the heavy precipitation is anticipated to occur day 7 (see WPC's 3-7 day
hazards outlook) extending into day 8. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
show
at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch, although the majority likely occurring on day 8. T=
he
uncalibrated 6Z GEFS ensemble highlights parts of Texas and Oklahoma as
receiving around one inch of rainfall and the 6Z deterministic GFS indicate=
s
parts of Texas receiving over 2 inches of rainfall, May 20.



The Weather Prediction Center anticipates the area under the slight risk fo=
r
heavy rain to experience anywhere from 1 to 5 inches of precipitation durin=
g
the prior week, while observed soil moisture levels across parts of the Low=
er
Mississippi Valley and Louisiana exceed the 90th historical percentile. Bot=
h
of
these factors as well as increased potential for heavy rainfall supports a
possible risk of localized river or flash flooding, which is highlighted fo=
r
eastern Texas. For a refresher on flood safety please consider the resource=

!vlVmlvvnpIMGzybW2MTSypIRpIFki_0TPz6Vf5KH2ghufmHDiFVbt8mdm8o5ag6El_2l1DQi$ =
.



Mid-level ridging is predicted to build across the Great Lakes region, Ohio
Valley, and Tennessee Valley at the beginning of the period, which could
support anomalously warm temperatures across the region. Both the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance for these areas to
experience maximum temperatures in the 85th percentile. However, temperatur=
es
are not anticipated to exceed 90 DegF, precluding a related excessive heat
risk
from being designated at this time.



Models continue to show no obvious hazardous weather concerns for Alaska ba=
sed
on predefined hazardous threshold criteria. Model guidance indicates a
transition from mid-level troughing to ridging during week-2, although ther=
e
is
significant model disparity regarding the timing. By week-2 the vast majori=
ty
of river ice should be broken up across Alaska, thus no temperature concern=
s
are apparent.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 18 - 22 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement today
with
regard to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over North Ameri=
ca.
Troughing is predicted over the Bering Sea and across the western CONUS, wh=
ile
ridging is forecast across the eastern U.S.

Increased probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are highlighte=
d
over the Southern Florida Peninsula, Northeast and central CONUS, extending
southwestward to parts of the interior western CONUS, underneath near to ab=
ove
normal mid-level heights and low level southerly flow. Below normal
temperatures are forecast over parts of the Pacific Northwest and Alaska
Panhandle, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal
temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, =
due
to forecast enhanced southerly surface and mid-level flow ahead of a mean
trough forecast over the Bering Sea.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the eastern CON=
US
and Great Lakes, underneath above normal 500-hPa heights. Predicted souther=
ly
flow and frontal activity significantly increase odds of above normal
precipitation over the Mid and Lower Mississippi Valleys and parts of the
Central and Southern Plains. Below normal precipitation is favored for part=
s
of
the Northern High Plains, Northern Rockies and  the western CONUS , consist=
ent
with the consolidation forecast tool. Over central and southern Alaska, an
active storm track is forecast on the northern periphery of the mean Pacifi=
c
ridge, leading to increased odds of above normal precipitation. Below norma=
l
precipitation is slightly favored for parts of western Mainland Alaska,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement in the model precipitation and temperature forecasts, offset by
differences among the forecast tools in the predicted temperature and
precipitation fields.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 20 - 26 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the Week-2 period depicts mean
mid-level troughing and near to below normal heights across the western CON=
US.
Positive height anomalies are predicted elsewhere over the CONUS, underneat=
h
mean ridging and anticyclonic mid-level flow. Over Alaska, near to below
normal
500-hPa heights are predicted for the region, associated with mean troughin=
g
over the Bering Sea and western Alaska.

Near to below normal temperature probabilities are increased across parts o=
f
the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Panhandle, associated with forecast trough=
ing
over the region and northerly surface flow. As predicted high pressure shif=
ts
eastward across the eastern CONUS throughout the period, return flow from t=
he
Gulf of Mexico favors increased probabilities of near to above normal
temperatures for the remainder of the CONUS. Mean southerly to southwesterl=
y
flow favors above normal temperatures across most of Mainland Alaska and th=
e
Aleutians.

Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation for much of the Northeast and
parts
of the Great Lakes, underneath forecast above normal heights. Increased odd=
s
of
above normal precipitation in most of the Central CONUS and parts of the
Southeast are associated with southerly flow and moisture advection from th=
e
Gulf of Mexico behind surface high pressure predicted over the Southeast, a=
nd
ahead of a mean mid-level trough forecast over the West. Despite the mean
trough over the Western CONUS, energy crossing the northwestern CONUS and
southern High Rockies is not expected to amplify until it reaches the Plain=
s,
leading to enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities in most of the
northwestern CONUS and Northern High Plains. Above normal precipitation
chances
continue to be increased over most of Alaska due to troughing forecast over
the
Bering Sea and western Mainland Alaska, and the ridging over the eastern
Pacific, favoring an active storm track across much of Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=

day-to-day consistency in the dynamical model guidance, offset by continued
uncertainty in dynamical model forecast precipitation and temperature field=
s
over the CONUS and Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Wed May 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm area was added to portions of central
and eastern North Dakota. Tomorrow afternoon and evening, isolated
thunderstorms are expected to develop with the passage of a subtle
mid-level impulse across northern North Dakota. Storms will likely
initiate during the early afternoon across northern parts of the
state and move southeast towards southern/eastern North Dakota by
early evening. The storms will be relatively slow moving in nature.
Nonetheless, latest guidance continues to suggest that precipitable
water values will barely exceed 0.60 in, with the sub-cloud layer
extending up to 800-700 mb, promoting enough rainwater evaporation
to support some dry-strike potential given adequate buoyancy in the
-10 to -30C layer. The biggest driver for isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights is the record dry fuels across the area, where an
appreciable grassfire ignition rate is possible given such dry
fuels, particularly with any density of lightning strikes on the
periphery of stronger storm cores.

Otherwise, locally Elevated conditions remain possible in
terrain-favoring locations of the Southwest. Brief instances of dry
downslope flow may promote 15+ mph sustained winds to overlap with
the widespread critically dry RH in place across the southern Great
Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin.

..Squitieri.. 05/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Wed May 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak downslope flow is expected in the lee of the Sierra which could
lead to some elevated conditions in portions of Nevada, but at this
time conditions appear too localized to warrant an elevated
delineation.

Conditions in northeast North Dakota and northwest Minnesota will be
similar on Thursday to today (Wednesday). However, an increase in
moisture is expected which should lead to higher relative humidity.
Showers and thunderstorms may accompany this increased moisture as a
weak mid-level shortwave trough traverses the region. PWAT values
will be very dry around 0.5 to 0.6 inches and record dry fuels are
present. Therefore, at least some consideration will need to be
given toward the potential for dry thunderstorms and lightning
induced grass fires. Will not introduce an IsoDryT area at this time
due to limits in predictability and storm coverage as well as dry
thunderstorms being a rare event in this region, but later forecasts
will closely examine this potential.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley early to middle of next week...

1830 UTC Update...

Not much has changed with the new 00z/06z guidance. The 00z ECMWF
has backed off a bit on such strong ridging over the East the
second half of the period, which brings it a little more in line
with other pieces of guidance. With that, there were really only
minor changes made to the previous forecast and so the thoughts
and details outlined in the discussion below still stand. The WPC
progs for this cycle favored a pure deterministic blend
(ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET) for days 3-5, with a majority blend towards
the ensemble means by day 7. Minority weighting of the ECMWF was
carried throughout the entire period just to lend some
deterministic details to the forecast.

Santorelli


Previous discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...

...Overview...

Thanks to recent trends in GFS runs toward the ongoing majority
consensus, today's guidance shows better agreement with the large
scale evolution during the period. Within a mean trough aloft
forecast to be established over the West, a leading trough/upper
low progressing from California through the Southwest or Great
Basin and then ejecting into the Plains should be followed by an
upstream trough that should reach the West by next Tuesday.
Meanwhile the combination of an initial Rockies/Plains ridge and a
faster moving southern Canada/northern tier U.S. ridge will likely
build into the East toward the middle of next week. The mean
evolution aloft along with a surface pattern that should promote a
multi-day feed of Gulf moisture will favor the best potential for
heavy rainfall over portions of the Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Weak shortwave energy filtering through the generally rising
heights aloft over the East may extend some areas of meaningful
rainfall into parts of the East. Also expect some precipitation
over portions of the Rockies while the second Pacific trough
should bring some rain and high elevation snow into the Northwest.
Double-digit temperature anomalies should be mostly of the warm
variety and are most likely from the Northwest into the northern
High Plains.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Over the past day the GFS has made significant progress in
adjusting its Pacific through North America pattern faster toward
other guidance. So instead of developing a Great Lakes closed low
from northern tier/southern Canada shortwave energy, the GFS is
weaker and waits until New England and the Canadian Maritimes to
show amplification--a more plausible scenario with latest CMC runs
and GEFS/ECMWF means also suggesting this possibility. However
there are still issues with this energy and possibly other weak
low-predictability shortwaves over the East, creating a lot of
latitude spread for rainfall/convective systems that may extend
eastward from the Midwest. Preference is for an intermediate
solution, between the more amplified GFS/GEFS and least amplified
(with strongest ridging) 12Z ECMWF. Farther west, guidance is
still waffling a bit with specifics of the trough/upper low
initially over California but the consensus timing appears to be
fairly consistent through at least Monday followed by typical
divergence with some dependence on upstream flow. As for the
second western trough, a blend approach represents the mean
pattern well while downplaying the more extreme details such as
the 12Z ECMWF developing more southeastward amplitude than most
other guidance by next Wednesday. Late the period the new 00Z
ECMWF compares better to the guidance average in both respects.
Based on guidance comparisons the starting blend incorporated a
composite of operational guidance for the weekend and then trended
toward 40-70 percent total input of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means
by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday as confidence in various model
specifics declined.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early in the period expect weak shortwave energy and a wavy front
to focus one area of rainfall over parts of the Central Plains and
Midwest while improving Gulf inflow will begin to increase
rainfall over the Southern Plains. Some of the activity over the
Midwest could eventually reach into the Ohio Valley/eastern states
as the focusing front and shortwave energy extend farther
eastward, though currently there is some uncertainty over the
precise latitude of this axis. Confidence is somewhat greater for
a multi-day threat of heavy rainfall over the Southern Plains and
parts of the Mississippi Valley through early-mid week as the low
level flow of Gulf moisture should persist and the initial western
U.S. upper system emerges into the Plains. Parts of this area have
seen much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks,
which may increase flooding concerns. Across the Rockies/High
Plains, there may be some enhancement of precipitation due to
potential for some easterly upslope flow along with the system
emerging from the West. In most cases any precipitation to the
west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered. Activity
reaching the Northwest late in the period may be somewhat better
organized but should still be on the lighter side of the spectrum.
Higher elevations may see some snow. The upper trough about to
depart from the East Coast may produce areas of mostly light
mid-late day rainfall from the northern Mid-Atlantic into the
Northeast during the weekend.

One or more days with highs of 10-15F or so above normal will
extend from the Northwest U.S. into the northern High Plains with
an upper ridge moving over the area and warm flow ahead of a
frontal system moving into the West. In contrast the system
crossing southern parts of the West should bring moderately below
normal highs to areas from the far southwestern U.S. into southern
High Plains. The Northwest should see highs drop to below normal
levels by next Tuesday-Wednesday behind the late-period front.
Meanwhile moderately cool temperatures over the eastern half of
the country during the weekend (though up to minus 10F or so
anomalies for morning lows over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Saturday) will moderate to yield
near-normal highs and somewhat above normal lows Monday-Wednesday.

...Showers and thunderstorms to wind down from the Central Gulf
Coast to Georgia/Florida on Thursday...

...Below normal temperatures expected east of the Rockies while
western third of the country warms up...

A frontal boundary that has meandered along the southeastern U.S.
for the past few days will finally push off into the Gulf of
Mexico tonight, drying out much of the coast behind it beginning
tomorrow. However, through tonight, additional showers and
thunderstorms are possible across the Gulf Coast states and into
the Carolinas. Flash floods remain possible, especially since the
region has seen wet conditions over the past several weeks.
Additionally, portions of the Southeast could see strong to severe
thunderstorms, with strong winds and hail possible in southeastern
Alabama, southern Georgia, and northern Florida.

Elsewhere, an area of low pressure will spawn scattered showers
and thunderstorms for the Northern and Central Plains over the
next couple of days. On Thursday, some storms could have strong
winds associated with them in the Central Plains. Some light
showers are also possible in the Northeast through tomorrow,
mainly in the form of rain, but some isolated thunderstorms can't
be ruled out in northern Maine.

Temperatures are forecast to be below normal generally east of the
Continental Divide, though Florida should remain warmer than
average before a cold frontal passage tonight into tomorrow. Cold
morning lows will once again cause Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories across the the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast.
Cool high temperatures could set daily records for portions of the
Southeast tomorrow, with highs only in the 60s. Meanwhile,
temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal in
the West, with temperatures in the 90s in some areas and eclipsing
100 degrees in the Desert Southwest.

Temperatures are forecast to be below normal generally east of the
Continental Divide, though Florida should remain warmer than
average before a cold frontal passage tonight into tomorrow. Cold
morning lows will once again cause Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories across the the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast.
Cool high temperatures could set daily records for portions of the
Southeast tomorrow, with highs only in the 60s. Meanwhile,
temperatures are forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal in
the West, with temperatures in the 90s in some areas and eclipsing
100 degrees in the Desert Southwest. There's an elevated risk of
fire weather across the North Dakota/Minnesota border for tonight,
and a risk of isolated dry thunderstorms for that same area
tomorrow.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CDT Thu May 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
...Eastern North Dakota...

A dry airmass is in place across the northern Plains this morning
with dewpoints in the 20s to 30s. A weak mid-level shortwave trough
will cross North Dakota this afternoon and provide enough weak
ascent for shower and thunderstorm development by this afternoon.
PWAT values are forecast to be around 0.6 to 0.7 which should result
in limited precipitation from these storms. However, storm motion is
expected to be slow which could lead to increased rainfall
accumulation from storms. Regardless, record dry fuels in the region
should be primed for fire starts. Therefore, an isolated dry
thunderstorm delineation is warranted. In addition, low-level winds
are forecast to be 10 to 15 mph which could lead to some fire
spread.

...Synopsis...
Weak lee cyclogenesis is expected across Nevada on Friday as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough approaches the Sierra. In response, some
downslope flow is expected in the lee of the Sierra and some gusty
winds are possible across portions of Arizona. Elevated fire weather
conditions are possible, but are forecast to be too localized to
warrant an elevated delineation at this time.

...Heavy rainfall possible over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Mississippi Valley from early through at least middle of next
week...


...Overview...

The majority of guidance continues to show the establishment of a
western trough/eastern ridge upper pattern and persistent flow of
Gulf moisture around East Coast surface high pressure, leading to
a multi-day threat of significant rainfall over portions of the
Southern Plains into Mississippi Valley. Locations and magnitude
of heaviest rainfall may vary on a day-to-day basis and some
specifics may take until well into the short range to be resolved,
but there is a consistent signal for a wet pattern over the
central U.S. Some variation of this pattern could extend beyond
the medium range period based on the latest 8-14 Day forecast from
the Climate Prediction Center. In addition to this area of focus,
locations from the Central Plains/Midwest east-southeastward into
the Mid-Atlantic may see one or more convective systems aided by a
wavy front and shortwave energy aloft, and improving consensus for
the upper low tracking through the Southwest toward the Plains is
suggesting greater potential that the central Rockies/High Plains
may see a period of enhanced precipitation. An upstream trough
reaching the Northwest will likely bring unsettled weather to that
region but with lighter totals.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The preferred consensus forecast maintains good continuity with
only minor detail adjustments, though individual solutions
continue to show some divergence and run-to-run changes. The
northeastern Pacific upper trough reaching the Northwest had been
trending toward better clustering after a period of significant
spread, but the 12Z ECMWF suddenly adjusted slower to resemble
some GFS runs from a couple days ago. After day 4 Monday a
composite of latest GEFS/ECMWF means and GFS runs, and old 00Z/12
ECMWF represented the established consensus. Among the new 00Z
runs, the UKMET becomes somewhat strong/fast but the GFS/CMC and
GEFS mean continue to provide an intermediate cluster. Meanwhile
the models agree fairly well for the upper low tracking through
the Southwest into the southern Rockies early-mid period. As this
feature likely opens up as it reaches the Plains, some spread
develops due in part to differences with the upstream trough.
Farther east there are still notable differences for what becomes
of shortwave energy that progresses from the Northern
Plains/southern Canada. Among the possibilities include the Plains
energy lingering for a time over the Midwest as an upper ridge
passes by to the north, while the new 00Z UKMET uses Canadian
energy to form a Great Lakes upper low (another aspect seen in
some GFS runs from a couple days ago and then abandoned). Ensemble
means and remaining models wait until this energy reaches New
England and the Canadian Maritimes to amplify. The 12Z ECMWF is
underdone with New England troughing relative to the means.
If/where an upper low forms is still up for debate, with CMC runs
dropping a low just off the East Coast while other solutions have
been well eastward or northward. Guidance comparisons led to
following an operational model blend early, replacing the 12Z
ECMWF with the prior 00Z run by day 5 Tuesday, and then
transitioning to a model/mean mix for balancing the consensus
pattern with some operational detail where possible. In most
respects the new 00Z ECMWF has come in with a better comparison to
consensus/preference.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The overall forecast is consistent in highlighting the potential
for a multi-day wet pattern over the central U.S., most likely
over parts of the Southern Plains into the Mississippi Valley, as
persistent low level flow from the Gulf transports moisture into
the region. Areas of heavy rainfall may be somewhat more
organized/focused around Tuesday-Wednesday as the upper system
crossing the Southwest approaches and reaches the Plains. Some
pockets of meaningful rainfall should continue into Thursday but
perhaps with less focus depending on how the energy from the
Southwest system weakens/progresses. Parts of this area have seen
much above normal precipitation over the past several weeks, which
may increase flooding concerns. Meanwhile the guidance signal
appears to be strengthening for a period of enhanced precipitation
over the central Rockies/High Plains during the first part of the
week, from the combination of low level upslope flow and favorable
location relative to the Southwest upper low's track. The trailing
upper trough reaching the Northwest should bring mostly light to
moderate precipitation to the region from about Monday night
onward. Highest elevations could see some snow. A wavy front and
initial Northern Plains shortwave energy may promote one or more
convective systems that could produce locally heavy rainfall from
the Central Plains/Midwest east-southeastward. However there is
still considerable uncertainty over the magnitude and location of
rainfall within this axis. On Sunday parts of the Northeast may
see one more episode of mostly light mid-late day rainfall under a
departing upper trough.

Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West next week, an
area of highs 10-20F above normal will progress from the Northwest
U.S. into the northern High Plains and eastward near the Canadian
border.  The cooling trend behind the front should bring modestly
below normal highs. Meanwhile moderately below normal highs will
accompany the system initially tracking through the southwestern
states and then weakening as it ejects into the Plains. Most of
the East will see slightly below normal readings on Sunday
followed by a gradual warming trend to near or slightly above
normal temperatures.

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected for the
Central Plains over the next few days...

...Showers and thunderstorms and possibly heavy rain are also
likely across the Florida Peninsula...

...Below normal temperatures are forecast east of the Rockies
while the western third of the country warms up...

A couple of areas of weak low pressure are forecast to help create
scattered showers and thunderstorms across the Plains through the
latter part of this week. In the Central Plains, severe weather is
possible with wind and hail threats, as well as frequent
lightning. There is also some potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms today in portions of North Dakota. Generally less
than an inch of rain is expected until forecasted amounts increase
on Saturday. Some thunderstorms and light rain are also possible
in the Great Basin near a frontal boundary.

A cold front slowly moving southward across Florida will cause
showers and thunderstorms across the peninsula through Friday.
Through tonight, a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in place
for southeastern Florida for isolated flash floods. Some rain may
continue across southern parts of Florida on Friday. Meanwhile,
rain chances are expected to increase across parts of Texas Friday
night into Saturday.

Temperatures are forecast to be below normal for the most part
east of the Continental Divide underneath a cool surface high
pressure system. Cold morning lows have once again caused Freeze
Warnings and Frost Advisories to be issued for this morning over
parts of the Great Lakes region, Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and
Northeast. Cool high temperatures could set daily records for
portions of the Southeast again today, with highs only in the 60s.
Temperatures should moderate gradually closer to normal on Friday
and Saturday but still be below normal. Meanwhile, temperatures
are forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal in the West, with
temperatures in the 90s in some areas and eclipsing 100 degrees in
the Desert Southwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CDT Mon Oct 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on morning observations and recent hi-res ensemble guidance.
Winds are already strengthening to 15-20 mph across the southern
Plains as the regional pressure gradient tightens. Additionally, RH
reductions into the 30-40% range are noted across parts of the high
Plains, which lends further support to the ongoing forecast. While
the strongest winds remain expected across northern OK/central KS,
the probability for elevated conditions remains most likely across
northeast NM into southeast CO. Forecast concerns regarding the
mid-Missouri Valley, outlined in the previous discussion below,
remain valid based on recent surface trends and morning guidance.

..Moore.. 10/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1106 PM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong shortwave trough now along the northern California coast
will progress eastward and become more closed off with time. As this
feature nears the Four Corners, a deepening lee trough and
cyclogenesis is expected in the central High Plains. With the
anticyclone maintaining strength within the Southeast, strong
southerly winds are likely across parts of the southern and central
Plains.

...Northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado...
The deepening lee trough will combine with modestly strengthening
westerly winds aloft to promote breezy conditions during the
afternoon. Surface winds of 15-20 mph are possible and are the
higher confidence portion of the forecast. RH during the afternoon
continues to be rather varied in guidance. The typically dry HRRR
shows a period of about 3-4 hours where elevated to near critical
conditions are possible. With a general moistening trend expected,
dry conditions will depend on downslope winds along the southern
Rockies. Highlights remain where dry grasses exist and where
confidence is highest in a few hours of elevated conditions.

...Mid-Missouri Valley vicinity...
A low-level jet is expected to develop in response to the
approaching shortwave. Some of the stronger winds in the Plains are
expected in this region for that reason. While RH is likely to have
improved from the diurnal minima seen Sunday afternoon, 25-30% is
possible in some areas with localized values near 20%. Locally
elevated fire concerns are possible within cured crops and corn
stover. Confidence in RH and broadly dry fuels is too low for
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 PM CDT Mon Oct 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

Only minor adjustments were made based off recent guidance, which
has shown a slight increase in the probability for elevated
conditions across west/northwest KS. The northern and eastern
extents of the fire weather threat remain somewhat uncertain and
will be determined by the placement and progression of a southward
moving cold front across CO/KS and a dryline  across the Plains. The
severity of the wind/RH combinations outlined in the discussion
below remain on track.

..Moore.. 10/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1147 PM CDT Sun Oct 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact, nearly closed low at upper levels will move across the
central Rockies and into the central Plains on Monday. Strong
mid-level winds will exist along the southern flank of the low. At
the surface, a lee cyclone will slowly deepen through the day in the
central High Plains. A cold front will eventually move into the
region as the surface low shifts eastward.

...Parts of the southern/central High Plains...
Given the favorable timing of the surface low reaching maximum
strength during the mid/late afternoon, areas of strong surface
winds (15-25 mph) are possible from east-central Colorado into the
northwest Texas Panhandle. The mid-level jet will also be favorably
placed across this region leading to even stronger gusts. More of
southeast Colorado was included in elevated highlights given the
favorable alignment of the mid-level winds with terrain passes where
the strongest winds are expected. Downslope warming and drying could
produce localized RH near 10% with most other areas seeing 15-20%.
Fuels should maintain enough dryness to support fire spread in
conjunction with the elevated to locally critical meteorological
conditions.

FOR TUESDAY OCTOBER 26 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 01: There is good multi-model
depiction of mid-level troughing across the Northeast Pacific, with the axi=
s
extending from Alaska to offshore of the West Coast of the CONUS. This patt=
ern
is anticipated to continue from the end of week-1 into week-2,  gradually
weakening throughout the period. This longwave trough favors an increased
chance of atmospheric rivers and heavy precipitation affecting California a=
nd
the Pacific Northwest. The GEFS and ECMWF Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT)
indicates the greatest likelihood for enhanced values (>250 kg/ms) across t=
he
West Coast from the beginning of week-2 (Oct 26 to 28). A slight risk of he=
avy
precipitation is posted for parts of primarily the West Coast states, Oct 2=
6
to
28, where the model IVT values are most enhanced and where the reforecast
tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the
85th
percentile and one inch. A moderate risk of heavy precipitation is highligh=
ted
across parts of the Northern Coast Range and Sierra Nevada of California fr=
om
Oct 26 to 28, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict at least a 4=
0%
chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 2
inches, liquid equivalent. Heavy rainfall may trigger flooding and debris
flows, especially over burn scarred areas of the West. However, the early
season precipitation would be beneficial to drought-stricken areas of the
West.
No heavy snow hazards are posted due to the expectation that significant sn=
ow
accumulations are forecast to be limited to the highest elevations of the
Cascades and Sierra Nevada Mountains.



The amplified mid-level trough and increased chance of atmospheric rivers
across the West also support a slight risk of high winds for parts of the
region. Both the reforecast tools indicate the greatest high wind potential=
 at
the beginning of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is post=
ed
across parts of the northwestern CONUS based on the anticipated synoptic fl=
ow
as well as guidance from the deterministic model guidance and reforecast
tools.
The deterministic 6Z GFS indicates the potential for localized wind speeds
exceeding 25 mph inland and 35 mph off and alongshore. The GFS suggests tha=
t
the highest wind speeds along and offshore would likely parallel to the
coasts,
rather than having a strong onshore component. This mid-level trough may
support increased chances for localized areas across parts of the West at t=
he
beginning of the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and freezing initially W=
est
of the Rockies at the start of week-2, expanding to the western half of the
CONUS toward the end of week-2. The GEFS reforecast tool, however, indicate=
s a
significantly weaker signal for this feature, with temperatures falling to
these thresholds across California and Nevada day 8 (Oct 26) and quickly
diminishing by day 9 (Oct 27). Due to these model differences and the
expectation for the axis of the mid-level trough remaining offshore, a rela=
ted
much below normal temperature is not designated.



The mid-level pattern is anticipated to be fairly progressive, with the
potential for a series of mid-level shortwave troughs propagating across th=
e
central and eastern CONUS during week-2. An initial shortwave at the beginn=
ing
of the period may support surface low formation and associated frontal
activity
across the central CONUS at the beginning of the period. This surface low
formation in addition to anticipated surface high pressure building across =
the
Four Corners may result in a tight pressure gradient across the Rockies and
High Plains, supporting increased likelihood for high wind speeds in the le=
e
of
the Rockies. A slight risk of high winds is posted for parts of the Central
Rockies and Northern and Central Plains, Oct 26 to 28, where both the GEFS =
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceed=
ing
the 85th percentile and 25 mph.



The aforementioned potential surface low and frontal activity across the
central CONUS combined with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico may also
support increased chances for localized heavy precipitation across parts of
the
southeastern quadrant of the CONUS. The reforecast tools indicate at least =
a
20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one i=
nch
across parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southea=
st,
Oct 26 to 28. Due to the expectation of a fairly progressive pattern and th=
e
anticipation that this would not be a multi-day enhanced precipitation even=
t,
a
related hazard is not designated at this time.



Mid-level troughing and associated surface low formation over the Gulf of
Alaska is forecast for Alaska throughout week-2. However, reforecast tools =
are
unsupportive of precipitation amounts reaching hazard thresholds, as the
orientation of the associated surface low over Gulf of Alaska favors the
majority of the strong onshore flow further south, primarily to the West Co=
ast
of the CONUS.

Valid 12Z Thu Oct 21 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 25 2021

...Heavy rainfall potential next weekend from central California
to western Washington...

...Overview...

Guidance shows a fairly amplified mean pattern that will be slow
to evolve over time.  A mean trough aloft over the eastern
Pacific/West Coast will support a period of active weather in its
vicinity from late week onward, with a series of strong
northeastern Pacific storms bringing at least a couple fronts into
and through the West with heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
Downstream from an upper ridge drifting across central Canada, an
upper low expected to be over Ontario/Quebec late this week and
weekend should anchor a trough that extends over the eastern half
of the country.  This trough will likely show some
progression/flattening by early next week.  Weak mean ridging
aloft will drift across the central U.S.  This ridge may connect
with the Canadian ridge at times but one or more shortwaves
ejecting from the West could filter through it as well.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

For about the first half of the period the best model clustering
consisted of the 00Z GFS/ECMWF, latest ensemble means, and 00Z
UKMET.  The starting blend used the 00Z GFS/ECMWF and a little CMC
as the 00Z UKMET was not available locally.  The 06Z GFS strayed
to the west of consensus with the upper low between the Great
Lakes and Hudson Bay, ultimately leading to premature flattening
of the eastern U.S. upper trough.  The preferred cluster showed an
earlier establishment/definition of a front that sets up over the
Plains and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  Meanwhile continuity and
agreement are good with an initially very deep Pacific storm that
brings a leading front into the West and then another front that
approaches the West Coast by early Saturday.

By the latter half of the period, guidance generally shows a
steady deepening of the upper trough whose axis should reach the
West Coast by early next week.  This suggests an evolution toward
heavier/farther south precipitation but individual model
runs/ensemble members show quite a bit of spread for the details
of upper dynamics and the track/strength/timing of any potentially
vigorous storm systems.  At this time prefer to lean toward a
model/mean blend that provides a conservative depiction of surface
waviness while awaiting better agreement for specifics of a better
defined system.  Also this blend leans away from 00Z/06Z GFS runs
that are on the aggressive side of guidance with bringing height
falls through the West.  The 12Z GFS compares better to the
model/ensemble mean consensus.  Farther east, the combined details
of how quickly the eastern trough begins to lift out and
low-predictability details of energy passing through the central
U.S. mean ridge will affect the position of the Plains into
east-central U.S. front and embedded waves.  GFS/ECMWF runs have
not been very consistent thus far.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, expect multiple periods of
rain/showers from northern California to western Washington, and
some of the rain will likely be moderate to heavy at times with
moist onshore flow ahead of Pacific storm systems/fronts.  Highest
totals of at least several inches for the five-day period will be
possible over favored coastal and windward terrain.  Snow is
likely for the highest mountains of the Cascades and Sierra
Nevada, mainly above pass level.  By the weekend guidance
continues to show the signal for an atmospheric river event
reaching into the coastal ranges of northern California and
southwest Oregon.  Strong winds are also possible near the coast.
By Sunday and into Monday some of this moisture should reach the
Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies while gradual
deepening of the upper trough may push meaningful precipitation
southward into central California.  At this time confidence is
below average for important details of any potentially strong
eastern Pacific storms that could enhance winds and precipitation
focus.  Great Lakes into eastern Canada low pressure and a
trailing wavy front crossing the East late this week will produce
mainly light to moderate rainfall due to system progression.
Meanwhile an area of locally moderate to heavy rain will be
possible over the Midwest/Lower Ohio Valley during the weekend, to
the north of a front that sets up over parts of the south-central
U.S.

In terms of temperatures, the West Coast states will see a slowly
expanding area of below normal highs during the period due to the
upper trough and clouds/precipitation.  The core of highs 10-15F
or so below normal should be centered over the northern half of
California and far southwest Oregon.  Below normal highs may reach
into the Great Basin by next Monday.  In contrast the southern
Plains will see increasing coverage of above normal readings with
plus 10-15F anomalies becoming more common Saturday-Monday.  It
will feel more like mid November across much of the Northern
Plains in the wake of the departing storm system on Thursday, with
high temperatures running about 5-10F and locally slightly more
below average.  Expect a gradual moderation in northern tier
temperatures going through the end of the workweek and into the
weekend as an upper-level ridge begins to build in.  The northern
High Plains may reach up to 10F above average by next Monday.  On
Thursday it will feel more like late September over the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast with highs on the order of 5-10F or so
above average ahead of an advancing cold front.  Frontal passage
will bring highs down to near or slightly below normal.

300 PM EDT Mon October 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 24 - 28 2021

The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles continue to depict highly amplif=
ied
mid-level longwave troughing stretching from Alaska into the Northeast Paci=
fic
and western CONUS during the 6-10 day period. Ridging is indicated over the
central CONUS, with substantial positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending
into north-central Canada. As a result, downstream troughing is forecast in
the
Northeast early in the period and models, particularly the ECMWF ensemble,
have
trended stronger with this feature compared to yesterday. Enhanced troughin=
g
in
the Northeast CONUS is also supported through teleconnection analysis with =
the
positive height anomaly center forecast over Hudson Bay. As the period
progresses, shortwave troughing is forecast to traverse the CONUS, resultin=
g
in
a deamplification of the mid-level height pattern, favoring a trend toward
higher mid-level heights in the East by the end of the period. Today=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
manual
500-hPa height blend depicts negative height anomalies across nearly all of
Alaska and much of the western CONUS, positive height anomalies over the
east-central CONUS, and below normal heights for the Northeast for the 6-10
day
period as a whole.

Troughing and associated negative height anomalies forecast over the wester=
n
CONUS favor increased probabilities for below normal temperatures west of t=
he
Rockies. Due to the enhanced ridging predicted downstream, probabilities fo=
r
above normal temperatures are elevated for much of the CONUS east of the
Rockies, with the highest probabilities (greater than 70%) centered over th=
e
Central and Southern Great Plains. A slight tilt toward enhanced probabilit=
ies
for near to below normal temperatures is indicated across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, as a result of troughing forecast to build earl=
y
in
the period. The GEFS reforecast tool, as well as its uncalibrated version,
depict a more expansive area of cooler temperatures in these areas compared=
 to
the ECMWF products, although the ECMWF products are cooler compared to
yesterday. By day-10 this trough is forecast to lift out of the region,
favoring relatively warmer temperatures in the East compared to earlier in =
the
period. Increased chances for near to below normal temperatures are indicat=
ed
for most of Alaska due to the amplified troughing forecast across the state=
.
The exception is over the northeastern Mainland, where increased probabilit=
ies
for above normal temperatures are depicted as a result of the increased
easterly flow forecast, resulting in enhanced positive temperature advectio=
n
of
the relatively warmer temperatures forecast downstream over Canada. This is
supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

Troughing off the West Coast of the CONUS favors high probabilities of abov=
e
normal precipitation across the western CONUS. Atmospheric river guidance f=
rom
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict enhanced integrated vapor transpor=
t
from the Pacific throughout the period. These enhanced probabilities are
forecast to spread farther inland as shortwave troughing breaks off and
quickly
moves across the CONUS. Enhanced frontal activity and potential surface low
pressure developing ahead of this trough favors increased chances for above
normal precipitation extending through parts of the east-central CONUS and
Southeast. Surface high pressure forecast across the Southwest and Southern
Plains favors enhanced probabilities for below normal precipitation over th=
ese
regions. Near to below normal precipitation probabilities are forecast acro=
ss
the Northeast, given the anomalously northwestery mid-level flow predicted
throughout most of the period as the aforementioned troughing early in the
period shifts further to the East. Enhanced odds of near to below normal
precipitation are favored across Alaska, including the Aleutians and
Panhandle,
as high amplitude troughing is forecast to suppress the mean storm track to
the
south of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, giv=
en
overall good model agreement, offset slightly by the deamplification of the
pattern forecast across the CONUS by day-10 and the resultant impacts on th=
e
temperature and precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 26 - NOV 01, 2021

The mid-level pattern during week-2 is forecast to deamplify across the CON=
US.
As a result, a more zonal flow is forecast over the CONUS compared to the 6=
-10
day period, though troughing remains indicated over the Northeast Pacific a=
nd
Alaska. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models all depict a weakening of t=
his
trough toward the end of week-2, which may allow ridging to develop across =
the
western CONUS and subsequent downstream troughing to the east. For the week=
-2
period as a whole, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 500-hPa manual height =
blend depicts negative
height
anomalies across most of the western CONUS and Alaska. Near normal heights =
are
indicated for the much of the remainder of the CONUS, with slightly above
normal heights forecast across parts of the Southwest, Southern Plains, Gre=
at
Lakes, and Interior Northeast.

The troughing in the Northeast Pacific is forecast to continue to result in
enhanced probabilities for below normal temperatures over the western third=
 of
the CONUS. Further displaced from the mean longwave troughing, increased
Pacific flow favors increased chances for above normal temperatures east of
the
Rockies, with the highest probabilities (greater than 60%) depicted across =
the
Upper Mississippi Valley. The reasoning for the temperature forecast across

The week-2 precipitation forecast is very similar to that of the 6-10 day

favoring increased probabilities of below normal precipitation. Enhanced
probabilities for near to below normal precipitation are indicated for Alas=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=

In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=

"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

...Upper level low to generate accumulating mountain snowfall from
the Sierra Nevada to the Intermountain West...

...Elevated Risk of fire weather in the Central-Southern Plains
today and tomorrow...

...Below normal temperatures to persist in the West; seasonally
cool temperatures along the East and Gulf Coasts to moderate by
mid-week; warmest temperatures versus normal in the Upper Midwest
& Great Lakes...

As a large dome of high pressure keeps a tranquil weather pattern
in place across much of the South and East, the western half of
the Lower 48 will feature the most active weather to kickoff the
work-week. An area of low pressure associated with a potent
upper-level low is forecast to continue an eastward track from the
northern Great Basin into the heart of the Intermountain West by
tonight. As the system progresses east toward the Rockies,
snowfall accumulations over a foot are possible in higher
elevations through Wednesday morning, particularly over portions
of the Wasatch, Wind River, Laramie, Bighorn, and Front ranges.
Accordingly, portions of Central Wyoming remain under a Winter
Storm Watch (with embedded Winter Storm Warnings), while a Winter
Weather Advisory is in effect in Northeast Utah through Tuesday.
Meanwhile, lower elevation areas in the Intermountain West can
expect benign showers and thunderstorms that will subside by
Tuesday night as the system ejects over the Plains. South of the
precipitation activity, the passage of a cold front will produce
gusty winds across portions of the Desert Southwest and Southern
Great Basin, where Wind Advisories are in effect through this
evening. The next round of active weather in the West arrives
Tuesday afternoon as another Pacific system brings rain and some
mountain snow chances to the Pacific Northwest. East of the
Rockies, the approach of the strong upper-level low will
facilitate lee troughing over the Plains, where dry and breezy
conditions support an Elevated Risk of fire weather today and
tomorrow over the Central/Southern Plains per the SPC Fire Weather
Outlook. Locally, a Red Flag Warning and Fire Weather Watch
encompasses Southwest Kansas and Southeast Colorado through
tomorrow evening.

Temperatures the first half of the week will be coolest versus
normal over the western third of the CONUS. Daily temperature
departures ranging between 10 to 15 degrees below normal are
anticipated today for much of California and Nevada. As the upper
trough responsible for the wintry weather in the Rockies moves
east on Tuesday, temps will cool to below normal levels as it
works in tandem with another cold front pushing south through the
Northern Plains. Meanwhile, seasonally cool temperatures will
stick around in the Deep South and along the East Coast today.
Look for temperatures to gradually warm up along the Gulf and East
Coasts, eventually returning to above normal levels by mid-week.
Lastly, the regions witnessing the warmest temperatures versus
normal will be the Midwest and Great Lakes today and Tuesday.
Daytime highs will soar into the 70s with some locations in the
central High Plains potentially reaching as high as 80 degrees.

...Heavy rainfall potential next weekend from central California
to western Washington...

...Overview...

Guidance shows a fairly amplified mean pattern that will be slow
to evolve over time.  A mean trough aloft over the eastern
Pacific/West Coast will support a period of active weather in its
vicinity from late week onward, with a series of strong
northeastern Pacific storms bringing at least a couple fronts into
and through the West with heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
Downstream from an upper ridge drifting across central Canada, an
upper low expected to be over Ontario/Quebec late this week and
weekend should anchor a trough that extends over the eastern half
of the country.  This trough will likely show some
progression/flattening by early next week.  Weak mean ridging
aloft will drift across the central U.S.  This ridge may connect
with the Canadian ridge at times but one or more shortwaves
ejecting from the West could filter through it as well.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

For about the first half of the period the best model clustering
consisted of the 00Z GFS/ECMWF, latest ensemble means, and 00Z
UKMET.  The starting blend used the 00Z GFS/ECMWF and a little CMC
as the 00Z UKMET was not available locally.  The 06Z GFS strayed
to the west of consensus with the upper low between the Great
Lakes and Hudson Bay, ultimately leading to premature flattening
of the eastern U.S. upper trough.  The preferred cluster showed an
earlier establishment/definition of a front that sets up over the
Plains and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  Meanwhile continuity and
agreement are good with an initially very deep Pacific storm that
brings a leading front into the West and then another front that
approaches the West Coast by early Saturday.

By the latter half of the period, guidance generally shows a
steady deepening of the upper trough whose axis should reach the
West Coast by early next week.  This suggests an evolution toward
heavier/farther south precipitation but individual model
runs/ensemble members show quite a bit of spread for the details
of upper dynamics and the track/strength/timing of any potentially
vigorous storm systems.  At this time prefer to lean toward a
model/mean blend that provides a conservative depiction of surface
waviness while awaiting better agreement for specifics of a better
defined system.  Also this blend leans away from 00Z/06Z GFS runs
that are on the aggressive side of guidance with bringing height
falls through the West.  The 12Z GFS compares better to the
model/ensemble mean consensus.  Farther east, the combined details
of how quickly the eastern trough begins to lift out and
low-predictability details of energy passing through the central
U.S. mean ridge will affect the position of the Plains into
east-central U.S. front and embedded waves.  GFS/ECMWF runs have
not been very consistent thus far.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, expect multiple periods of
rain/showers from northern California to western Washington, and
some of the rain will likely be moderate to heavy at times with
moist onshore flow ahead of Pacific storm systems/fronts.  Highest
totals of at least several inches for the five-day period will be
possible over favored coastal and windward terrain.  Snow is
likely for the highest mountains of the Cascades and Sierra
Nevada, mainly above pass level.  By the weekend guidance
continues to show the signal for an atmospheric river event
reaching into the coastal ranges of northern California and
southwest Oregon.  Strong winds are also possible near the coast.
By Sunday and into Monday some of this moisture should reach the
Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies while gradual
deepening of the upper trough may push meaningful precipitation
southward into central California.  At this time confidence is
below average for important details of any potentially strong
eastern Pacific storms that could enhance winds and precipitation
focus.  Great Lakes into eastern Canada low pressure and a
trailing wavy front crossing the East late this week will produce
mainly light to moderate rainfall due to system progression.
Meanwhile an area of locally moderate to heavy rain will be
possible over the Midwest/Lower Ohio Valley during the weekend, to
the north of a front that sets up over parts of the south-central
U.S.

In terms of temperatures, the West Coast states will see a slowly
expanding area of below normal highs during the period due to the
upper trough and clouds/precipitation.  The core of highs 10-15F
or so below normal should be centered over the northern half of
California and far southwest Oregon.  Below normal highs may reach
into the Great Basin by next Monday.  In contrast the southern
Plains will see increasing coverage of above normal readings with
plus 10-15F anomalies becoming more common Saturday-Monday.  It
will feel more like mid November across much of the Northern
Plains in the wake of the departing storm system on Thursday, with
high temperatures running about 5-10F and locally slightly more
below average.  Expect a gradual moderation in northern tier
temperatures going through the end of the workweek and into the
weekend as an upper-level ridge begins to build in.  The northern
High Plains may reach up to 10F above average by next Monday.  On
Thursday it will feel more like late September over the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast with highs on the order of 5-10F or so
above average ahead of an advancing cold front.  Frontal passage
will bring highs down to near or slightly below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 PM CDT Mon Oct 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough now over Utah will continue eastward today.
Strong mid-level winds will be present along the southern flank of
this trough. At the surface, a cyclone will develop through the day
in the central High Plains. As the cyclone moves eastward toward the
central Plains by the end of the afternoon, a cold front will pass
through the central High Plains and into the southern/central
Plains.

...Parts of the southern/central High Plains...
Gusty winds are possible early in the day across the region. The
surface low may undergo slow intensification during the day and
early afternoon, which would lead to some favorable overlap of
strong winds along with minimal RH. Winds of 15-20 mph are quite
likely. With the mid level jet aloft, some areas, particularly
within the terrain passes, could see winds of 20-35 mph at least
briefly. Downslope warming and drying will bring RH to near 10%
locally with 15-20% more common. Elevated to locally critical fire
weather is expected as the area with the driest fuels will likely
see critical conditions briefly due to progression of the cold
front.

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough within the central Plains will move east into
parts of the upper Midwest on Wednesday. Low-amplitude ridging aloft
will develop across the West with the exception of a deamplifying
shortwave trough moving through the Northwest. At the surface, a
cold front will continue moving south and east. Cooler temperatures
behind the front will elevate RH across most the Plains. Drier
conditions are possible in the central Great Basin and the
Southwest, but weak winds and poorly receptive fuels will keep fire
weather concerns very low.

...Heavy rainfall potential next weekend from central California
to western Washington...

...Overview...

An active weather pattern will be developing across the western
U.S. by the end of the week as a series of strong storm systems
off the West Coast pivot around a rather pronounced trough over
the northeast Pacific.  This will result in a couple of cold
frontal passages that will progress inland across the
Intermountain West with heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
Meanwhile across the eastern U.S., a cold front and upper level
trough will be exiting the East Coast by Friday afternoon with a
Canadian surface high settling southward across the Plains and
Midwest.  A warm front extending across the Midwest and Ohio
Valley early next week will likely provide a focus for showers and
storms.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in decent agreement with the
overall synoptic scale pattern through Saturday night,
particularly with the timing of the cold front reaching the East
Coast and the first Pacific cold front affecting the West Coast
region, so a GFS/ECMWF/CMC model blend sufficed as a starting
point in the forecast process.  The 00Z CMC strayed from the model
consensus by Sunday with a much stronger trough crossing the
Plains that evolves into a closed low over the Midwest by Monday
night with very little ensemble support, so the latter half of the
forecast was primarily derived from a GFS/ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS blend
along with some previous WPC continuity.

For the storm system reaching the West Coast Saturday night, the
GFS is a bit more amplified and faster, with height falls
spreading across the Intermountain West sooner that the CMC/ECMWF.
  By the end of the forecast period, the CMC is stronger with a
shortwave trough crossing the central Plains, whereas the ensemble
means are suggesting more of an upper ridge axis here.  For days 6
and 7, the WPC forecast incorporated more of the EC and GEFS
means, while still maintaining some of the operational guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of rain are expected
from northern California to western Washington, and some of these
rain showers will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow
ahead of multiple Pacific storm systems.  This will especially
hold true for Sunday and into early morning as a deep moisture
plume moves inland across much of central and northern California
as part of an atmospheric river event.  Some locations may get on
the order of 4 to 8 inches of rain over the entire forecast
period, particularly across windward terrain which may result in
some instances of flooding.  Snow is likely for the highest
mountains of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, mainly above pass
level.  Snow levels are expected to be lower by late Sunday and
into Monday with the potential for over a foot of snow for the
highest elevations.  Strong winds are also possible near the
coast.  Some of this moisture is expected to reach the
Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies with
significant snowfall for some of these areas.  Across the eastern
U.S., a warm front lifting northward across portions of the
Midwest and Ohio Valley this weekend and into Monday is expected
to produce scattered to numerous showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel more like late September
across much of the central and southern Plains as the upper level
ridge remains in place across this region, with highs running up
to 15 degrees above normal.  Generally cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the
upper trough and mainly overcast skies with highs on the order of
10-20 degrees below normal.  Temperatures should be generally
within 5 degrees of climatological averages for the eastern U.S.
through early next week.

...Heavy rainfall and mountain snow potential next weekend from

For the storm system reaching the West Coast on Sunday, the CMC

faster and a little weaker than the ECMWF, so a blend of these two

...Heavy rainfall and mountain snow potential next weekend from
central California to western Washington...

...Overview...

An active weather pattern will be developing across the western
U.S. by the end of the week as a series of strong storm systems
off the West Coast pivot around a rather pronounced trough over
the northeast Pacific.  This will result in a couple of cold
frontal passages that will progress inland across the
Intermountain West with heavy precipitation and gusty winds.
Meanwhile across the eastern U.S., a cold front and upper level
trough will be exiting the East Coast by Friday afternoon with a
Canadian surface high settling southward across the Plains and
Midwest.  A warm front extending across the Midwest and Ohio
Valley early next week will likely provide a focus for showers and
storms.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in decent agreement with the
overall synoptic scale pattern through Saturday night,
particularly with the timing of the cold front reaching the East
Coast and the first Pacific cold front affecting the West Coast
region, so a GFS/ECMWF/CMC model blend sufficed as a starting
point in the forecast process.  The 00Z CMC strayed quite a bit
from the model consensus by Sunday with a much stronger trough
crossing the Plains that evolves into a closed low over the
Midwest by Monday night with very little ensemble support, so the
latter half of the forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/ECENS/GEFS blend along with some previous WPC continuity.

For the storm system reaching the West Coast on Sunday, the CMC
and UKMET are considerably stronger with the surface low compared
to the more modest GFS and ECMWF solutions.  The GFS is slightly
faster and a little weaker than the ECMWF, so a blend of these two
solutions worked well as a starting point.  For next Tuesday, the
WPC forecast incorporated more of the EC and GEFS means, while
still maintaining some of the operational ECMWF/GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of rain are expected
from northern California to western Washington, and some of these
rain showers will likely be heavy at times with moist onshore flow
ahead of multiple Pacific storm systems.  This will especially
hold true for Sunday and into early morning as a deep moisture
plume moves inland across much of central and northern California
as part of an atmospheric river event.  Some locations may get on
the order of 4 to 8 inches of rain over the entire forecast
period, particularly across windward terrain which may result in
some instances of flooding.  Snow is likely for the highest
mountains of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada, mainly above pass
level.  Snow levels are expected to be lower by late Sunday and
into Monday with the potential for over a foot of snow for the
highest elevations.  Strong winds are also possible near the
coast.  Some of this moisture is expected to reach the
Intermountain West and the central/northern Rockies with
significant snowfall for some of these areas.  Across the eastern
U.S., a warm front lifting northward across portions of the
Midwest and Ohio Valley this weekend and into Monday is expected
to produce scattered to numerous showers and perhaps some
thunderstorms.

In terms of temperatures, it will feel more like late September
across much of the central and southern Plains as the upper level
ridge remains in place across this region, with highs running up
to 15 degrees above normal.  Generally cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the
upper trough and mainly overcast skies with highs on the order of
10-20 degrees below normal.  Temperatures should be generally
within 5 degrees of climatological averages for the eastern U.S.
through early next week.

...Upper level low going cross country this week to produce heavy
mountain snow in the Rockies and severe weather in the Midwest...

...A pair of Pacific storm systems to kickoff an extended period
of unsettled weather from the Pacific Northwest to Northern
California...

...Temperatures gradually warming up in the East, staying
seasonally cool in the West; showers and thunderstorm possible
along the central Gulf Coast; Elevated Risk for Fire Weather in
the central High Plains...

An upper low over Utah is advancing east towards the central
Rockies later today, generating lower elevation rainfall and
periods of mountain snow along its route. Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued for parts of Wyoming, including the Wind River
and Big Horn mountains ranges where 1 to 2 feet of snowfall is
expected. Light accumulations are also possible from the Wasatch
and Colorado Rockies to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Within
the warm sector of a strengthening low pressure system over the
central Plains, scattered thunderstorms are expected to flare up
from central Nebraska to the Upper Mississippi Valley. In fact, a
Marginal Risk for severe weather is in place for parts of the
Midwest this evening. The wave of low pressure tracks into the
Great Lakes by Wednesday forcing showers and thunderstorms to
develop from the Midwest and mid-Mississippi Valley to the eastern
Corn Belt. This storm system's swath of heaviest rainfall is
forecast to occur from southern South Dakota and southern
Minnesota to central Wisconsin.

Farther west, the West Coast is preparing for what will feel like
a never ending series of Pacific storm systems directing
atmospheric river after atmospheric river over the next seven
days. The first storm system arrives late Tuesday into Wednesday
ushering Pacific moisture into Northern California and up the
coast to western Washington. Some light snowfall accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Sierra Nevada and Cascades are
possible, but rainfall totals over one inch are likely along the
coastal range of Northern California and into the lower elevated
areas along the slopes of the northern Sierra Nevada. Overall this
is good news for drought stricken areas of California and Oregon,
but as an even more powerful storm system approaches the second
half of the week (and more subsequent storm systems to follow in
the medium range), burn scar areas could become subjected to
debris flows and flash flooding. A Day 3 Marginal Risk for
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for Thursday in parts of
Northern California for not only potentially heavy rainfall rates,
but to highlight the opportunity for debris flows and rapid
run-off near burn scar areas.

Elsewhere, high pressure sliding east over the Southeast region
allows for the return of southerly flow in the Mid-South today and
eventually reaching the East Coast late Wednesday into Thursday.
The result is abnormally warm temperatures making a comeback after
a few days worth of seasonally cooler conditions. Meanwhile, due
to the persistent rounds of upper troughs slamming into the
western third of the Lower 48, temperatures will generally stay on
the cooler than normal side, although some parts of the interior
Northwest may witness abnormally mild conditions. In the South,
areas of showers and thunderstorms may lead to locally heavy
totals along the Central Gulf Coast mid-week due to a weak
mid-level disturbance nearby. Last but not least, there is an
Elevated Risk for fire weather conditions in parts of the central
High Plains. Red Flag Warnings have been posted in southeast
Colorado and southwest Kansas due to the favorable fuels present
for fire weather.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1047 AM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST NEVADA...

Morning observations and recent model guidance continue to support
the ongoing forecast with only minor adjustments needed. Critical
conditions remain most likely in the lee of the Sierra with a swath
of elevated conditions to the east across the northern Great Basin.
Elevated conditions may develop as far north as north-central MT,
but recent rain over the past 7 days has largely mitigated fuel
readiness. A dry thunderstorm or two is possible across far northern
UT/southwest WY, but confidence and coverage are too limited to
warrant highlights.

..Moore.. 08/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level winds will persist across parts of the Northwest
and northern Rockies today. Moderately strong mid-level flow will
stretch as far south as northern Nevada. A surface front will move
through the Northwest and reach northern Nevada and central Idaho by
the end of the period.

...Nevada...
Critical weather is expected to occur once again across a similar
area as Monday. Mid-level winds will combine with an increasing
surface pressure gradient of the approaching boundary to bring 20-25
mph winds to the immediate lee of the northern Sierra. RH could
approach single digits in some locations with 10-15% more broadly
occurring. Similar RH will extend into northeastern Nevada, but
winds speeds will be less at 15-20 mph. Elevated conditions are
expected across the remainder of northern Nevada.

...Northern Rockies and Wyoming...
Fuel receptiveness based on ERCs in most areas is at or below
normal. Though winds will likely reach 15-20 mph, with some areas of
20+ mph in central Idaho into southwest Montana, highlights will be
withheld. RH of 15-20% may lead to locally elevated concerns where
fuels are drier.

(eastern) U.S. during the early part of week-2, but large forecast uncertai=
nty
exists in the pattern later in week-2. Following the heavy rainfall and
flooding associated with the remnants of Ida, a drier pattern is anticipate=
d
for much of the central and eastern U.S. However, a tropical system could
emerge from the Caribbean Sea next week. Mid-level low pressure centered ov=
er
the Bering Sea is expected to bring above normal precipitation to much of
Mainland Alaska during early to mid-September.

HAZARDS

Flooding possible for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 03 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!sC2RZKuyN2kBeWIfVilSju0QB_welunjDoQWMPIrwmggeFGG46Z6Pk774spKt=
2wJvVZUDi_3$

FOR WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 08 - TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 14: Major Hurricane Ida made
landfall near Port Fourchon, Louisiana on Aug 30. Heavy to excessive rainfa=
ll
(6 to 15 inches, or more) accompanied Ida as it tracked inland across
southeastern Louisiana and Mississippi. As a result, moderate to major rive=
r
flooding is ongoing across the Lower Mississippi Valley. Flooding along the
smaller streams is likely to end this week but flooding may linger along
larger
rivers through at least the early part of week-2. Heavy rain is forecast to
result in small stream and potentially river flooding across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic this week, but this flooding is expected to recede by week-2.



A broad area of low pressure is expected to form over the southwestern
Caribbean Sea during the next few days. Environmental conditions appear to =
be
favorable for slow tropical cyclone (TC) development. The deterministic
Canadian model remains consistent and most bullish with a TC tracking into =
the
Gulf of Mexico and eventually affecting the western Gulf Coast next week.
Although the GFS and ECMWF models continue to favor a tropical wave with
little
or no TC development, a slight risk of heavy rainfall is posted for the
western
Gulf Coast and the Lower Mississippi Valley since this region will be prone=
 to
additional flooding. Also, a cold front shifting south may trigger locally
heavy rainfall there regardless of TC development.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldron Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned more
than 168,000 acres and is only 16% contained. As a 500-hPa ridge amplifies
over
western North America heading into week-2, above normal temperatures are
likely
throughout the West. The ridging aloft is expected to peak in strength arou=
nd
day 7, supporting a continuation of a slight risk of excessive heat across
parts of California and Oregon through Sep 9. Maximum temperatures may exce=
ed
100 degrees F across the Central Valley of California and reach 90 degrees =
F
as
far north as Portland, Oregon. Later in week-2, spread becomes larger among
GFS
and ECMWF ensemble members which reduces forecast confidence.



A slight risk of excessive heat is also posted for parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Southern Great Plains, and Lower Rio Grande Valley wher=
e
heat index values could be near or above 105 degrees F. With more than one
million power outages currently reported across southeast Louisiana, predic=
ted
above normal temperatures with heat index values near or above 100 degrees =
F
are a concern for residents that remain without power.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on
the large scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium
range period, but struggle with smaller scale embedded details of
individual systems, especially by early next week. The most
notable area of uncertainty continues to be surrounding what is
left of Tropical Depression Ida by Friday and Saturday (likely a
post-Tropical system). The ECMWF has been consistently on the
slower side of the guidance to lift the system out of the
Northeast, while the GFS continues to be quite a bit faster. The
CMC, along with the ensemble means, at this point, seem to offer
the best middle ground solution which is also consistent with the
latest track guidance from the WPC tropical advisories for Ida.

Including Ida, and across the rest of the CONUS, a general model
blend on days 3-4 between the ECMWF/CMC (and a minor percentage of
the GFS) worked well as a starting point for the WPC medium range.
For days 5-7, incorporated increasingly more weighting of the
ECENS to help mitigate some of the detail differences surrounding
energy into eastern Canada and the upper Great Lakes. This
approach fit reasonably well with previous shift continuity as
well.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ida is forecast by WPC to become a well organized post-tropical
cyclone that will be lifting/exiting offshore New England Friday.
Uncertain interaction from northern stream energies may alter
Ida's track and development as a maritime hazard. Ida is expected
to be absorbed into a well organized northern stream low over the
Canadian Maritimes whose wrapping rains may prove slow to exit
northern New England into Saturday given closed low/upper trough
support and proximity. A moderating trailing front will settle
down into the Southeast.

Upstream, a continued series of northern stream upper troughs will
force several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out
though the north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next
week into the east-central U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced convection from the central Plains to Upper Midwest
Friday, with more modest potential downstream into the
east-central U.S. in the wake of Ida. The next trough to move into
the north-central U.S. should bring another chance for organized
rainfall across parts of the Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next
Monday into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, lingering deepened moisture from was was previous
tropical cyclone Nora may fuel some locally heavy downpours as
enhanced by terrain over the southern Rockies Friday into Saturday
around the western periphery of a potent south-central U.S. upper
ridge. The ridge shifts slowly westward over the Southwest forcing
a modest monsoonal channel back into southern NM/AZ/CA to the east
of an upper trough off CA into next week. Meanwhile, the
breakthrough approach of northeast Pacific systems into western
Canada and the Northwest U.S. will foster advent of a periodically
wet pattern into western WA this weekend.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 PM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

The forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments needed
based on recent trends in ensemble guidance. A zone of elevated
conditions remains possible across east/northeast CO and west KS.
However, guidance continues to trend towards higher RH for parts of
the region, which maintains low confidence in the coverage and
duration of the fire weather threat. Highlights may be needed for
this region in subsequent outlooks if observations begin to fall in
line with drier solutions.

..Moore.. 08/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0115 AM CDT Tue Aug 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper trough in the Northwest will begin to lift to the
northeast on Wednesday. Moderately strong mid-level winds will
remain across the region into the northern Great Basin. With the
trough lifting away, the surface boundary in the northern Great
Basin will stall. A lee trough will develop in the northern and
central High Plains leading to strong southerly winds in those
regions.

...Central/northern Sierra...
Remnant mid-level winds and a adequate surface pressure gradient
will help drive 15-20 mph winds in the immediate lee of the terrain.
10-15% RH appears probable during the afternoon. Given some terrain
augmented winds, areas of near critical to locally critical fire
weather may occur. However, most areas will see elevated concerns.

...Central High Plains...
Winds are expected to reach 20-25 mph across the region. The primary
uncertainty will be how low RH will fall and for how broad an area.
Given the fairly persistent southerly surface winds the last several
days, it would seem that the typically dry model solutions may too
aggressive in the amount of drying/mixing. Furthermore, there is
expected to be increasing moisture throughout the profile. Given
that moisture and the cloud cover that is expected to occur with it,
locally elevated conditions are currently all that is expected. The
primary area for this would likely be along the Kansas/Colorado
border. No highlights will be added this outlook.

30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR SEPTEMBER 2021

During the latter half of August, equatorial Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs=
)
have remained near to below average across most of the tropical Pacific Oce=
an.
The latest weekly SST departure in the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 region was=
 -0.3C. This weekly
value of the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 index is little changed from the mos=
t recent three
month
observations of the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 index (corresponding to the M=
ay-June-July
season)
which stood at -0.4C. Equatorial Pacific SSTs are generally forecast to rem=
ain
near to below normal with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions becoming more=
 likely as we
progress through the upcoming fall. Meanwhile, a weak Madden-Julian
Oscillation
(MJO) signal has stalled over the Indian Ocean since Mid-August. The
combination of the most recent evolutions of the El Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo S=
outhern Oscillation
(ENSO) and the MJO would tend to favor above normal 500-hPa heights across =
the
western and northeastern CONUS and mean troughing near the Mississippi Vall=
ey
during the month of September. Additionally, the current ENSO/MJO evolution
would favor below normal 500-hPa heights over the Gulf of Alaska. Uncertain=
ty
in the evolution of the MJO during the month of September is high,
contributing
to the potential of a highly variable and incoherent pattern across much of
the
forecast domain for the upcoming month. WPC short term and CPC week-2 and
weeks
3-4 outlooks, dynamical model guidance, trends, and analysis of antecedent
boundary layer conditions were used to complement the background ENSO and M=
JO
signals where applicable.



Uncertainty in the temperature outlook is high, as MJO composites indicate =
a
weak signal and dynamical model guidance forecasts a highly variable patter=
n
across much of the CONUS as the month of September progresses. Therefore,
equal
chances of above, below, and near normal temperatures are indicated for a
large
portion of the CONUS from the Rockies to the East Coast. Above normal
temperatures are favored west of the Continental Divide due to support from
MJO
composites and dynamical model guidance. A very slight tilt toward above
normal
temperatures is indicated for the Northeast based primarily on MJO composit=
es
and CFSv2 guidance. However, the magnitude and coverage of this signal were
reduced relative to the mid-month outlook as shorter term signals indicate =
the
potential for a relatively cool pattern early in September. Warmer than nor=
mal
conditions are slightly favored for the Florida Peninsula, consistent with
recent trends. Conversely, there is a slight tilt toward below normal
temperatures for parts of the Tennessee and Lower Mississippi Valley,
consistent with dynamical model guidance and mean troughing over the
east-central CONUS suggested by ENSO/MJO composites. Statistical and dynami=
cal
model guidance generally support a mild pattern across southern Alaska.
Therefore, enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures were expande=
d
across southern Alaska relative to the mid-month outlook. The greatest
probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated over parts of
southwestern Alaska, due, in part, to above normal SSTs in adjacent waters.



Above normal precipitation is favored from the western Gulf Coast Region
northeastward to parts of the East Coast, consistent with mean troughing ov=
er
the east-central CONUS indicated by ENSO/MJO composites. Copious rainfall i=
s
expected early in the month for much of the Mid-Atlantic states associated
with
the remnants of Ida, greatly increasing the probabilities of above normal
precipitation for the month of September as a whole. Above normal
precipitation
is also favored for parts of the Southwest as dynamical model guidance
supports
influxes of monsoonal moisture early in the month. A drier than normal patt=
ern
is favored for the northwestern CONUS consistent with shorter term WPC
forecasts and monthly CFSv2 guidance. ENSO/MJO composites as well as a stor=
m
system predicted early in the month support a slight tilt toward above norm=
al
precipitation for southeastern Alaska.

The September 2021 outlooks are issued against the backdrop of El Ni=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDo
Southern
Oscillation (ENSO) Neutral conditions and an ongoing strong Madden-Julian
Oscillation (MJO) event. The most recent three month observations of the Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo
3.4 index (corresponding to the May-June-July season) indicated mean sea
surface temperature (SST) anomalies of -0.4C.  This represents a weakening
relative to the La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa event experienced during the past =
winter when the
average index value during the December-January-February season was near
-1.0C.
Equatorial SSTs are generally expected to remain near to below average with=
 a
re-emergence of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa conditions possible within the nex=
t three months and
a
La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa Watch is currently in effect. Additionally, an ong=
oing strong MJO
event
is currently propagating eastward over the Indian Ocean with the amplitude =
of
the Wheeler-Hendon index exceeding 2.5. The current evolution of these ENSO
and
MJO signals would tend to favor below normal 500-hPa heights across much of
the
eastern Contiguous United States (CONUS) and south of Alaska. Signals from =
the
MJO and ENSO conflict across western North America as MJO composites favor
much
higher 500-hPa heights relative to that produced by ENSO composites. It sho=
uld
be noted that the sample size of these composites are relatively small, thu=
s,
reducing the reliability of the signal. Analysis of the most recent monthly
and
subseasonal dynamical model guidance, recent trends, as well as contributio=
ns
from current environmental conditions were also utilized in the production =
of
these outlooks.



Above normal temperatures are favored for much of the western CONUS and
Northern Plains due to good agreement among dynamical model guidance and MJ=
O
composites. Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are largely
absent farther to the south and east across the remainder of the Plains, mo=
st
of the Mississippi Valley, and the Southeast, consistent with potential
troughing over the eastern CONUS suggested by MJO and ENSO composites. Belo=
w
normal temperatures are favored for the western and central Gulf Coast Regi=
on,
the Lower Mississippi Valley, and eastern sections of the Southern Plains,
supported by dynamical model guidance from the CFSv2 and Copernicus Climate
Change Service (C3S). Agreement is generally good among dynamical model
guidance for warmer than normal conditions across the Great Lakes and
Northeast. Thus, above normal temperatures are favored for these regions.
However, probabilities are tempered due to potential troughing across the
eastern CONUS suggested by MJO and ENSO composites. Uncertainty is high acr=
oss
most of Alaska due to weak or conflicting signals among dynamical model
guidance. Therefore Equal Chances (EC) of above, near, or below normal
temperatures are indicated for most of the state. However, above normal
temperatures are weakly favored for parts of coastal southwestern Alaska du=
e,
in part, to above normal SSTs in adjacent waters.



The potential for troughing may promote an active pattern across much of th=
e
central and eastern CONUS. This is supported by MJO and ENSO composites whi=
ch
favor above normal precipitation from parts of the Gulf Coast northeastward=
 to
the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic states and the CFSv2, which depicts a wet
pattern across most of the southern two-thirds of the CONUS. However,
probabilities are tempered due to lack of support from the NMME and C3S
dynamical model tools. Conversely, below normal precipitation is favored
across
much of the West as dynamical model guidance generally supports a dry patte=
rn,
particularly from the Great Basin to the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains. A wet pattern is favored farther to the north across southeastern
Alaska due to good dynamical model support and agreement with MJO composite=
s.
ENSO composites, as well as dynamical model guidance from the NMME and CFSv=
2
favor a dry pattern for parts of western Alaska, where elevated chances of
below normal precipitation are indicated.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 06 - 10 2021

Dynamical models are in good agreement regarding an amplified 500-hPa
circulation pattern forecast over North America during the 6-10 day period.=
 An
amplified trough is predicted to the west of Alaska over the Bering Sea. A
trough to the south of Alaska over the North Pacific in the 6-10 day period=
 is
predicted to deamplify. Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over much of Mainland Alaska in the GEFS, ECWMF, and Canadian
ensemble means, with greater positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the ECMWF
and
GFS high resolution runs. A ridge is predicted to persist over the western
CONUS. A predicted trough over the eastern CONUS is slightly more amplified=
 in
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble than in yesterday=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored over western Mainland Alaska,
due
to potential increased cloudiness ahead of a predicted trough, while above
normal temperatures are more likely for the Aleutians and eastern Mainland
Alaska, supported by the temperature consolidation and most dynamical model
temperature forecast tools. Near normal temperatures are favored over the
Alaska Panhandle, with increased uncertainty ahead of a de-amplifying troug=
h.
Above normal temperatures are likely for the western CONUS, from the Pacifi=
c
coast to western areas of the Northern Plains and across the Southern Plain=
s,
under a predicted ridge. Near to below normal temperatures are favored for
most
of the eastern CONUS, under a predicted trough. Above normal temperatures a=
re
likely for much of the Atlantic coast, with anomalously southerly flow ahea=
d

differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 08 - 14 2021

While a generally low amplitude mid-level circulation pattern is forecast
across North America during week 2, some large-scale features resemble the =
6-
10
day period forecasts. Weak ridging is forecast over the western CONUS in th=
e
ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensemble means, while a trough and negative 500-h=
Pa
height anomalies persists over the eastern CONUS. The 0Z and 6Z GEFS ensemb=
le
means indicate greater development of troughing along the west coast of the
CONUS, relative to the 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean. Dynamical model forecasts
predict a less amplified trough over the Bering Sea in week 2. Increased
ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the Gulf o=
f
Alaska into eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

While there are considerable differences among the tools, with an increase =
in
uncertainty in the week 2 period, the predicted temperature and precipitati=
on
patterns in week 2 are generally similar to the 6-10 day period forecasts,
with
somewhat lower probabilities. Near to below normal temperatures are favored
for
parts of western Mainland Alaska ahead of a predicted trough, while above
normal temperatures are favored for the Aleutians, the southwest coast of
Mainland Alaska, and eastern Mainland Alaska, supported by the temperature
consolidation tool. Above normal temperatures are likely for the western
CONUS,
under ridging and slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near to below
normal temperatures are favored for most of the eastern CONUS, under a
persistent trough. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for parts =
of
the Atlantic coast, supported by the temperature consolidation tool.

Enhanced chances of above normal precipitation continue for parts of wester=
n
Mainland Alaska, ahead of a predicted trough. Near normal precipitation
continues to be favored for the Aleutians as well as southern and eastern
Mainland Alaska, with uncertainty in a changing circulation pattern. Below
normal precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle, under increasing
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal precipitation is favored fo=
r
parts of the Pacific Northwest, across the Northern Rockies, and into most =
of
the Great Plains region under a predicted ridge. Near to above normal
precipitation is favored for a larger area of the West, with increasing
uncertainty on a developing trough along the Pacific coast. Near to above
normal precipitation is favored for the Great Lakes and Northeast regions
ahead
of the predicted trough. Slightly enhanced chances of below normal
precipitation for the Central Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and the
Southeast Atlantic coast states are supported by the precipitation
consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

...Widespread heavy rain, with areas of considerable to
significant and potentially life-threatening flash flooding, is
expected from the Tennessee Valley through the Upper Ohio Valley,
Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and southern New England in
association with T.D. Ida...

...Tropical moisture from the remnants of Nora will bring heavy
rain and widespread concerns for flash flooding, some of it
possibly significant, to the Southwest U.S. over the next couple
of days...

...Windy conditions and dry weather will continue to pose a fire
weather threat to areas of northern California and the northern
Great Basin going through Wednesday...

Tropical Depression Ida is forecast to advance northeast this
evening and overnight across the Tennessee Valley, and then cross
the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic states on Wednesday. By
Wednesday night the system will merge with a frontal zone and
become a post-tropical/extratropical cyclone and move just south
of Long Island and then away from New England on Thursday. Very
heavy rainfall is expected along and just north of the path of Ida
going through the period, and the expectation is for as much 3 to
8 inches of rain with isolated heavier amounts. This rainfall may
lead to areas of considerable to significant and life-threatening
flash flooding. In fact, the Weather Prediction Center has
highlighted areas of northern West Virginia, western Maryland,
southern Pennsylvania, and New Jersey in a High Risk of excessive
rainfall. Widespread moderate to isolated major river flooding
impacts are forecast across these same areas.

In addition to the flooding and flash flooding risks, Ida is
expected to bring a threat of severe weather to the Mid-Atlantic
states on Wednesday, and the Storm Prediction Center has
highlighted this area in an Enhanced Risk with damaging winds and
tornadoes the dominant concerns. This will mainly be focused along
and the south of Ida's track.

Meanwhile, an upper-level trough advancing east out across the
northern Plains coupled with a frontal zone will set the stage for
broken areas of showers and thunderstorms, some locally severe,
out across the northern and central Plains, and the Midwest, going
through Wednesday and Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center does
indicate a Slight Risk for severe weather over the northern Plains
on Wednesday with damaging winds and large hail the main concerns.

Elsewhere, tropical moisture associated with the remnants of Nora
will move over the Southwest and adjacent areas of the Great Basin
and Central Rockies through Wednesday and Thursday. Widespread
shower and thunderstorm activity is expected. This will drive a
widespread threat of flash flooding, some of which may be
significant. As a result, the Weather Prediction Center has
highlighted a Slight to Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall, with
an emphasis on southern Arizona. Any burn scars, dry washes, and
slot-canyons will be most sensitive to enhanced runoff concerns.

There is also a fire weather threat to parts of the West, with an
emphasis on northern California and Nevada going through
Wednesday. Red Flag Warnings and air quality alerts have been
issued accordingly, and especially with areas of widespread smoke.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on
the large scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium
range period, but struggle with smaller scale embedded details of
individual systems, especially by early next week. The most
notable area of uncertainty continues to be surrounding what is
left of Tropical Depression Ida by Friday and Saturday (likely a
post-Tropical system). The ECMWF has been consistently on the
slower side of the guidance to lift the system out of the
Northeast, while the GFS continues to be quite a bit faster. The
CMC, along with the ensemble means, at this point, seem to offer
the best middle ground solution which is also consistent with the
latest track guidance from the WPC tropical advisories for Ida.

Including Ida, and across the rest of the CONUS, a general model
blend on days 3-4 between the ECMWF/CMC (and a minor percentage of
the GFS) worked well as a starting point for the WPC medium range.
For days 5-7, incorporated increasingly more weighting of the
ECENS to help mitigate some of the detail differences surrounding
energy into eastern Canada and the upper Great Lakes. This
approach fit reasonably well with previous shift continuity as
well.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ida is forecast by WPC to become a well organized post-tropical
cyclone that will be lifting/exiting offshore New England Friday.
Uncertain interaction from northern stream energies may alter
Ida's track and development as a maritime hazard. Ida is expected
to be absorbed into a well organized northern stream low over the
Canadian Maritimes whose wrapping rains may prove slow to exit
northern New England into Saturday given closed low/upper trough
support and proximity. A moderating trailing front will settle
down into the Southeast.

Upstream, a continued series of northern stream upper troughs will
force several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out
though the north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next
week into the east-central U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced convection from the central Plains to Upper Midwest
Friday, with more modest potential downstream into the
east-central U.S. in the wake of Ida. The next trough to move into
the north-central U.S. should bring another chance for organized
rainfall across parts of the Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next
Monday into Tuesday.

Meanwhile, lingering deepened moisture from was was previous
tropical cyclone Nora may fuel some locally heavy downpours as
enhanced by terrain over the southern Rockies Friday into Saturday
around the western periphery of a potent south-central U.S. upper
ridge. The ridge shifts slowly westward over the Southwest forcing
a modest monsoonal channel back into southern NM/AZ/CA to the east
of an upper trough off CA into next week. Meanwhile, the
breakthrough approach of northeast Pacific systems into western
Canada and the Northwest U.S. will foster advent of a periodically
wet pattern into western WA this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0106 AM CDT Wed Sep 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Moderately strong mid-level winds will continue across parts of the
northern Great Basin today. A surface boundary will remain stalled
in northern Nevada as the main shortwave trough lifts northeastward.
A lee trough and weak cyclone in eastern Colorado will deepen
through the day.

...Parts of central/Northern Sierra Front...
A very dry airmass was sampled by the 00Z Reno sounding. Continued
mixing of mid-level winds to the surface and an enhanced surface
pressure gradient near the boundary will promote 15-20 mph winds,
with locally higher speeds, along the lee of the central/northern
Sierra. RH in the single digits will be possible, but 10-15% will be
more common. Elevated to locally critical fire weather concerns are
expected.

...Central High Plains...
A strong wind field should lead to 20+ mph winds across the region
during the afternoon. Some guidance, particularly those with a dry
bias, show elevated fire weather occurring along and near the
Kansas-Colorado border. Given the intensifying south-southwesterly
flow aloft and the expected quick moisture advection at low levels,
it seems unlikely that these conditions will occur broadly or for
any substantial duration. Local/brief elevated conditions are still
possible. No highlights will be added this outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 AM CDT Wed Sep 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Northwest will slowly being to
move east on Thursday. Mid-level winds across the Great Basin will
be on the decline. The surface boundary in Nevada will remain
relatively stationary. The overall fire weather pattern will not
favor significant concerns.

...Nevada...
The surface pressure gradient near the boundary and modest mid-level
winds may promote locally elevated conditions near and behind the
boundary across central Nevada. Given the marginal winds and
duration of the conditions, no highlights will be added.

...Willamette Valley into southwest Oregon...
A subtle setup for north/northeasterly winds will occur as the
upper-level trough shifts to the east during the afternoon and weak
high pressure moves into Washington. Both the surface pressure
gradient and the upper-level winds will be weak, but dry fuels would
support locally elevated conditions where winds can reach 15 mph and
downslope drying reduces RH to near or below 20%.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement on the
large scale upper flow pattern through much of the medium range
period for much of the nation, but still struggle with smaller
scale individual systems, especially by early next week.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of best clustered guidance from the
18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. This maintains reasonably good WPC
continuity for a pattern with near average forecast
predictability. This forecast baseline remains in line with newer
00 UTC guidance composites despite lingering embedded system
timing variances.


...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A series of energetic northern stream upper troughs will force
several wavy frontal systems into the Northwest and out though the
north-central U.S. and increasingly southward into next week
across the central and eastern U.S. with main upper trough
reinforcement/amplification. Conditions seem best for some locally
enhanced lead system convection from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-South and central Plains Saturday, with more modest potential
downstream more into the southern and eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday. The next trough to move into the north-central U.S. should
bring another chance for organized rainfall across parts of the
Midwest and Upper Great Lakes by next Monday into Tuesday, with
scattered trailing frontal activity then again settling down over
the southern and eastern states into next midweek in response to
upper trough amplification.

The breakthrough approach of northeast Pacific systems into
western Canada and the Northwest U.S. may foster some moderate
rain potential into northwest WA this weekend. Farther south,
lingering deepened moisture may fuel some local downpours as
enhanced by terrain over the southern Rockies into Saturday around
the western periphery of a potent south-central U.S. upper ridge.
The hot ridge shifts slowly westward over the Southwest/West next
week forcing a modest monsoonal channel back into southern
NM/AZ/CA to the east of an upper troughing off CA.

This ridge transition may also offer some room for
moisture/convection to lift across the western Gulf of Mexico in
about a week. NHC has collaborated bringing a tropical wave into
the Bay of Campeche to monitor for any development.

...Tropical Depression IDA is forecast to slowly weaken while
moving northeastward with a High Risk of excessive rainfall from
the northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through Thursday morning...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday morning...

the Central/Southern Rockies as former T. C. NORA=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDS moistu=
re
moves over the region through Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern/Central Plains through Thursday morning...

Tropical Depression IDA is forecast to slowly weaken and become a
Post-Tropical Cyclone by Thursday morning while moving
northeastward.  What was IDA will move off the Northeast Coast
also on Thursday morning.  However, IDA will continue to produce
heavy rain along the path into Thursday.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a High Risk of excessive rainfall from the northern
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through Thursday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create widespread areas of flash flooding.
Furthermore, severe, widespread flash flooding is expected with
IDA. Areas that normally do not experience flash flooding will
flood. Lives and property are in great danger through Thursday
morning from the northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

Furthermore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Thursday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.  What was IDA will move from the Mid-Atlantic into
New England by Thursday morning then move into the Canadian
Maritime Provinces by Friday.  IDA will continue to produce heavy
rain until it leaves the U. S.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern High Plains
westward to the Great Basin will move eastward into the Northern
Plains overnight Wednesday, producing showers and thunderstorms.
As a result, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern/Central Plains through
Thursday morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorms threat will decrease
slightly on Friday into Saturday.

Elsewhere, moisture associated with what was once Tropical Cyclone
NORA will move over the Southwest into parts of the Great Basin
and Central/Southern Rockies on Wednesday into Thursday, producing
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through
Thursday morning.  Additionally, there is a fire weather threat
over Northern/Central California as Red Flag Warnings have been
issued in these areas. Air Quality Alerts have also been published
over much of the Pacific Northwest and California and parts of
Wyoming and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.  There are also Heat
Advisories out for parts of the Southern Plains and the Lower
Mississippi Valley.

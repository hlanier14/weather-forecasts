Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1041 AM CST Sun Nov 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

Surface observations and RTMA data suggest that at least pockets of
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are ongoing
across portions of south central and southeast Colorado into
northeastern New Mexico. Today's fire weather forecast remains
mostly on track, with only minor adjustments made to account for
updated model and fuel guidance. Locally critical conditions are
most likely over South Park and eastern portions of Huerfano County
in Colorado, where the most favorable overlap of wind/rh and
critical fuels is expected through late afternoon. Any fire weather
concerns across southeastern Colorado, northeastern New Mexico,
southwestern Kansas, and the western Oklahoma Panhandle should
diminish by early/mid afternoon as surface winds weaken rapidly.
Though, poor overnight RH recoveries coupled with at least a modest
increase in westerly surface winds tonight could allow for at least
locally elevated fire weather conditions overnight across
southeastern Colorado and vicinity.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 11/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1225 AM CDT Sun Nov 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad region of enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow will
overspread much of the central/northern Rockies, in association with
a large-scale upper-level trough positioned over the West. At least
marginally enhanced mid-level flow should extend into portions of
the central/southern High Plains as well.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Surface dew point temperatures should remain in the low 20s F and
teens across the region, while temperatures warm into the upper 70s
F during the afternoon. This should result in RH values falling into
the teens amid a deeply mixed boundary layer. With the
aforementioned marginally enhanced mid-level flow aloft, surface
winds may approach 10-15 mph, with localized/terrain-enhanced winds.
Likewise, a few days of persistent dry conditions have allowed fuels
to cure (e.g., ERC values exceeding the 80th percentile). Thus, a
few hours of elevated conditions are possible across the highlighted
region.

Dry and somewhat breezy conditions should also occur farther south
across portions of northeast New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle.
However, a lack of fuel receptivity exists in this region, thus no
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1244 PM CST Sun Nov 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Please see the discussion
below for more information on tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 11/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1227 AM CDT Sun Nov 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad southwesterly mid-level flow over much of the western CONUS to
start the period will gradually orient to more of a zonal pattern as
a short-wave trough lifts into the northern Great Plains and is
replaced by a short-wave ridge. Consequently, flow in the mid levels
is forecast to remain quite marginal (30-35 kt) over portions of the
central/southern High Plains. Despite persistent dry conditions at
the surface, characterized by RH values into the teens during the
afternoon, surface winds are forecast to remain well below critical
thresholds. Thus, no fire-weather highlights have been introduced in
this outlook, although localized elevated fire-weather conditions
are possible across portions of the central/southern High Plains,
particularly in terrain-favored regions where fuels have recently
become receptive to large-fire spread.

Valid 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021 - 12Z Sun Nov 14 2021

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low mid-later week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later in the week...


...Pattern Overview...

Upper ridging to the southwest of California as well as over the
Canadian archipelago favors troughing over the central to eastern
CONUS later this week into the weekend. This favors a deepening
central states cyclone that will lift northeastward through the
Midwest/Great Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air over much of
the Lower 48 will trend cooler with time as the attendant cold
front sweeps eastward, favoring a widespread swath of modest to
locally heavy rain across much of the East. On the northwest side
of the low pressure, some wrap-around snow is likely over parts of
the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and central/northern
Appalachians next weekend.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution, but with continued uncertainty in timing,
track, and strength of the embedded systems including run-to-run
continuity issues. Given uncertainty in recent trends, a composite
blend was a prudent starting point that largely downplayed more
seemingly errant deterministic runs including the 06Z GFS and at
times the 00Z ECMWF. General overlap between many GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles favored using the National Blend of Models for most
grids with enhancements to its QPF overall, especially around the
Great Lakes next weekend but also in the East with the surface
low/front.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Amplifying upper pattern will support surface cyclogenesis over
the Upper Midwest late Wed into Thu as Gulf moisture streams
northward along and ahead of the cold front. Surface wave
development out of the lower Mississippi Valley could act to
enhance rainfall from the southern Appalachians northward into the
Northeast. As the system moves into Canada, backside cold air flow
by next Friday will likely support some snow over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the northern/central
Appalachians. This could be the first accumulating snow of the
season for some areas of northern Minnesota into the eastern
Dakotas. Temperatures will be near to above normal early in the
week, with possible record highs ahead of the front on Friday in
the Mid-Atlantic, but trending cooler by week's end especially
into the Southeast (relative to typical mid-November values
there). Please see WPC links below for all the details in
graphical format.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing several
rounds of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest,
especially later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy
rains and elevation snows over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low mid-later week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later in the week...


...Pattern Overview...

Upper ridging to the southwest of California as well as over the
Canadian archipelago favors troughing over the central to eastern
CONUS later this week into the weekend. This favors a deepening
central states cyclone that will lift northeastward through the
Midwest/Great Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air over much of
the Lower 48 will trend cooler with time as the attendant cold
front sweeps eastward, favoring a widespread swath of modest to
locally heavy rain across much of the East. On the northwest side
of the low pressure, some wrap-around snow is likely over parts of

...Powerful Pacific cyclone to deliver heavy rain and mountain
snow to Northern California and the Pacific Northwest...

...Coastal flooding along the Southeast coast to continue into
Monday...

...Warmer than normal temperature regime to engulf much of the
Central and Eastern U.S....

The weather pattern the first half of the week is highlighted by a
rapidly strengthening Pacific low pressure system that ushers in
copious amounts of lower elevation rain and mountain snow to
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest. The heaviest
rainfall amounts are likely to occur along the coastal range of
Northern California where 2 to 3 inches of rainfall is anticipated
through Tuesday evening. The Shasta and Trinity mountains may
witness heavy rainfall rates atop burn scarred areas, making those
locations more susceptible to flash flooding and debris flows. As
a result, a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been issued
for those "at risk" flash flood areas of Northern California.
Meanwhile, crashing snow levels allows precipitation to fall as
snow in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada, the Shasta,
Olympic, and Cascade Ranges. Up to a foot of snow is expected to
accumulate along these ranges with totals exceeding two feet
possible in the Olympics, Washington Cascades, and the tallest
portions of the Sierra Nevada and Shastas. Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued for parts of the Shastas ahead of this impending
storm system. As Pacific moisture pushes further inland,
measurable snow is also on tap for the Boise and Sawtooth
Mountains of Idaho on Tuesday with periods of snow eventually
reaching the northern Rockies by Tuesday night. In addition, high
winds are also a concern as High Wind Warnings and Advisories have
been posted in Oregon, Northern California, and in far western
Nevada.

East of the Rockies, the weather pattern remains relatively quiet
despite the passage of a weak frontal boundary traversing the
Midwest on Monday, then into the Great Lakes and Southern Plains
on Tuesday. Aside from a few spotty showers, little in the way of
precipitation is expected ahead of and along the front. Off the
Southeast coast, a potent storm system continues to generate large
swells that are causing areas of coastal flooding from the
Virginia Tidewater and the Carolina Coast on south to the eastern
coast of Florida. Coastal Flood Warnings and Advisories remain in
place into Monday but the storm moves far enough off the coast by
Tuesday for improving beach conditions along the Southeast coast.
Otherwise, the story for much of the East is the return of above
normal temperatures. After several days of chilly conditions where
many saw their first frost and/or freeze of the season, daily
temperature departures around 10 to 20 degrees above normal look
to engulf much of the Heartland on east across the Great Lakes on
Monday. Highs in the 60s return to the Northeast on Monday with
some sprinkled in 70 degree readings possible in the Mid-Atlantic
on Tuesday. The hottest temperatures the first two days of the
week will reside in West Texas where high temps soaring above 80
degrees are likely.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun November 07 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview...

It remains the case that upper ridging to the southwest of
California as well as over the Canadian archipelago favors
amplified troughing over the central to eastern CONUS later this
week into the weekend. This favors a deepening central states
cyclone that will lift northeastward through the Midwest/Great
Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air over much of the Lower 48
will trend cooler with time as the attendant cold front sweeps
eastward, favoring a widespread swath of modest to locally heavy
rain across much of the East. On the northwest side of the low
pressure, wrap-around and then lake effect snow is likely over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes late week and then the
central/northern Appalachians.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution and forecast clustering has improved slightly
Thu into Fri. A composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
seems reasonable, is in line with the NBM and GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means and maintains good WPC continuity in this time
frame. However, continued uncertainty in timing, track, and
strength of the embedded systems including run-to-run continuity
issues remains evident starting later Fri and onward. Given
uncertainty in recent trends, the WPC product suite was derived
from a composite blend of still compatible guidance from
GEFS/NAEFS and ECMWF ensembles and the National Blend of Models.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Amplifying upper pattern will support surface cyclogenesis over
the Upper Midwest into Thu as Gulf moisture streams northward
along and ahead of the cold front. Surface wave development out of
the lower Mississippi Valley could act to enhance rainfall from
the southern Appalachians northward into the Northeast. As the
system moves into Canada, backside cold air flow by next Friday
will likely support some snow over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes and subsequently with cold flow off the lakes and into the
northern/central Appalachians. This could be the first
accumulating snow of the season for some areas of northern
Minnesota into the eastern Dakotas. Temperatures will be near to
above normal early in the week, with possible record highs ahead
of the front on Friday in the Mid-Atlantic, but trending cooler by
week's end especially into the Southeast (relative to typical
mid-November values there). Please see WPC links below for all the
details in graphical format.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing several
rounds of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest,
especially later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy
rains and elevation snows over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview...

It remains the case that upper ridging to the southwest of
California as well as over the Canadian archipelago favors
amplified troughing over the central to eastern CONUS later this
week into the weekend. This favors a deepening central states
cyclone that will lift northeastward through the Midwest/Great
Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air over much of the Lower 48
will trend cooler with time as the attendant cold front sweeps
eastward, favoring a widespread swath of modest to locally heavy
rain across much of the East. On the northwest side of the low
pressure, wrap-around and then lake effect snow is likely over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes late week and then the
central/northern Appalachians.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0105 AM CST Mon Nov 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough positioned over the northern Great Plains will
shift east into the Great Lakes region throughout the day.
Meanwhile, another mid-level short-wave trough will move across the
Great Basin region into central/northern High Plains. Mid-level flow
within these features is expected to remain marginally enhanced. At
the surface, a cold front will move into portions of the southern
High Plains and stall out, with perhaps concurrent weak lee
cyclogenesis occurring. Warm/dry conditions will prevail south of
the front, across portions of northeast New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle. However, southeasterly surface winds are expected to
remain well below critical thresholds during the afternoon in most
areas. Thus, some potential for localized elevated fire-weather
conditions is possible, particularly in terrain-favored regions with
overlapping fuel receptivity.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level trough is forecast to enter the West Coast
and move across the Rockies into the central/southern High Plains by
the end of the forecast period. Strong northwesterly flow associated
with a mid-level jet streak will then enter the Pacific Northwest
and extend into portions of the Southwest. At the surface, lee
cyclogenesis should occur once again across the southern High Plains
during the afternoon. However, winds are expected to remain light in
most areas. Perhaps a few pockets of terrain-enhanced wind/RH combos
will emerge to support some potential for elevated fire-weather
conditions. However, such conditions are expected to be highly
localized, and thus, no highlights have been introduced.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern California through Tuesday morning...

...Rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern/Central California, and Northern Rockies/Great
Basin...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over the
Southern High Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Upper
Midwest...

A rapidly deepening area of low pressure will move over the
Eastern Pacific today, and the associated front will move onshore
late tonight into Tuesday morning. In response, moisture will
stream into Central/Northern California overnight with rain and
higher elevation snow spreading into parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern/Central California.  Consequently, the WPC
has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern/Central California due to the increased rain through
Tuesday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create localized
areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid
runoff with heavy rain.  As the storm system and associated
surface boundaries track east rain and higher elevation snow will
move inland over the Great Basin and into the Northern Rockies on
Tuesday, eventually impacting portions of the Central Rockies
overnight Tuesday. Rain will move into parts of the Northern
Plains by Wednesday morning with rain coming to an end in
California and most of the Northwest.

Meanwhile, a weak front from the Upper Great Lakes to the Central
Rockies will move east to off the Northeast Coast by Wednesday,
with the trailing boundary extending roughly southwestward to
parts of the Southern Plains.  Ahead of the front, temperatures
will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over the Southern High
Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Upper Midwest. The boundary
will produce light rain over parts of the Northeast to the Ohio
Valley overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this outlook. Current surface observations show the greatest RH
reductions extending along the eastern slopes of the Colorado Front
Range southward through far northeastern New Mexico and the
northwestern Texas Panhandle. Here, enhanced midlevel flow and
downsloping may result in single digit RH and gusty winds by this
afternoon. However, sustained surface winds should remain modest
(outside of wind-prone areas). Farther south, a swath of breezy
west-southwesterly surface winds (near 20-25 mph) will develop
across parts of eastern New Mexico. Locally Critical conditions may
develop across these areas, where the critically low RH and breezy
surface winds coincide for a couple hours. With that said, the small
spatial and temporal overlap of these conditions limit the need for
Critical delineations.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0139 AM CST Mon Dec 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface lee troughing will increase across the central and southern
High Plains as a mid-level trough approaches from the west today.
Modestly dry and breezy surface conditions are expected across the
southern High Plains by afternoon peak heating. 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds will overspread near-critical to
critically dry fuels from the Colorado Front Range to eastern New
Mexico/Texas Panhandle. Some questions remain in terms of how low
surface RH will drop by afternoon peak heating. Enough guidance
members depict widespread 20 percent RH coinciding with the stronger
winds, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights, though
low-end Elevated conditions are expected where RH struggles to drop
to 20 percent.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 PM CST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND EASTERN PARTS OF THE
OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS PANHANDLES...

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made to the outlook based on the latest high-resolution model
guidance. The Elevated area was expanded westward toward the higher
terrain of southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico, where
confidence is high in a few hours of Elevated conditions. Low-end
Critical conditions are still anticipated across parts of the
Oklahoma and Texas Panhandles, though the risk appears to be
shifting slightly westward. Minor modifications have been made to
the Critical delineation to account for this trend. For additional
details on the southern High Plains fire-weather threat, see the
previous discussion below.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Mon Dec 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strong, dry southwesterly surface flow will occur across the
southern Great Plains tomorrow/Tuesday, as a surface low rapidly
intensifies across southeast Wyoming with the approach of a vigorous
mid-level trough. Guidance consensus shows widespread 20-25 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds overspreading a critically dry
fuel bed from eastern Colorado down to the New Mexico/Texas border.
RH will struggle to drop into the 15-20 percent range during the
afternoon. Nonetheless, enough confidence exists to introduce
low-end Critical highlights across eastern portions of the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where RH is expected to dip into the
15-20 percent range, with several hours of strong southwesterly
surface winds atop critically dry fuels compensating to support a
wildfire-spread threat.

...Overview...

A fairly progressive weather pattern is expected in the medium
range period especially in the northern stream, as an initial deep
surface low lifts quickly northward into eastern Canada, though
its trailing front could stall across parts of the central and
eastern U.S. and produce heavy rainfall late this week. A series
of troughs will make their way across the northern tier of the
U.S. during the period, while a southern stream trough may
separate from the northern prevailing flow and move slowly across
the Southwest/northern Mexico this weekend. Ridging over the
southeast quadrant of the country should get suppressed early next
week and bring temperatures closer to normal after a mild/warm
spell.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Deterministic and ensemble models for the 00/06Z cycle remain
fairly well clustered with the overall pattern described above.
Early in the period, GFS runs were slightly west of consensus
(including the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC) with their positions of the
surface low north of the Great Lakes early Thursday, so those were
not weighted as heavily. But overall a blend of the deterministic
guidance worked well for the WPC forecast, with emphasis
especially on the 00Z ECMWF. By the weekend, there are some
initially minor differences with the aforementioned possibility of
stream separation in terms of timing and whether an embedded
closed low may form, and with strength of energy within northern
stream shortwave troughs as well. No particular trend was seen
with the southern stream trough as models are waffling with the
details. In the northern stream, the 00Z CMC was notably stronger
than consensus with another shortwave tracking through the
Midwest/Great Lakes by day 5/Saturday, so weighted it less by that
point. Farther upstream, another energetic shortwave looks to dive
into the Pacific Northwest over the weekend, but questions remain
with its strength and how far south it may dive and interact with
the southern stream feature by Monday. Thus by day 6/7, the WPC
pressures/fronts forecast used about half ensemble mean guidance
(from the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC) to temper the individual model
differences. This was in good agreement with the previous WPC
forecast products.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A potent upper trough along with a strong surface low will lift
quickly northeastward through the north-central U.S. Wed into Thu,
with some lingering snow and high winds possible in the Upper
Great Lakes region Thu. Southeast of the deep low track, upper
ridging should support some record warm temperatures ahead of the
cold front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting
from the east-central U.S. to the East Thu-Sat. The trailing
portion of the front will meanwhile stall across the South, with
an axis of enhanced rainfall and potential for local runoff and
flooding/flash flooding issues from the southern Plains through
the Mid-South/Ohio Valley with return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. A developing frontal wave may also bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the Great Lakes through northern New England
into the weekend as the enhanced rainfall axis drops southward
across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling high pressure
builds across the Plains and to the East.

Upstream, a moisture surge with moderate precipitation will work
into California and across the Northwest Thu ahead of an
approaching Pacific system. This system will gradually weaken into
Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system may then impact the
Pacific Northwest with moderate to possibly locally heavy
precipitation amounts Fri into the weekend.

...There is a Moderate of excessive rainfall over parts of Central
California through Tuesday morning; There is a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of Southern California on Tuesday
into Wednesday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and
Northern Rockies...

...Record warmth for the Central Plains by Wednesday, including
possible all-time December records...

...Critical Fire Weather risk for parts of the Southern High
Plains...

...Widespread significant wind gusts and blowing dust for the Four
Corners, Southern High Plains into the Central Plains...

An elongated mid-level low is currently digging southward along
the California coast, propelled by a very strong 160-180 mph
upper-level jet that extends from southern Alaska to the storm.
This jet energy will transfer to the to the mid-level low and
accelerate it into southern California late on Tuesday before
shifting across the Colorado Rockies on Wednesday.

Ahead of the base of the mid-level low, an atmospheric river is
currently set up impacting the central California coast.  While
the moisture is average to slightly above average, the strength of
the low is rapidly increasing low level wind response and focusing
the plume increasing rain rates to up to 1"/hr and additional
totals of 6" and so WPC has a moderate risk for excessive rainfall
and given proximity to burn scars may result in flash flooding,
debris flows and mudslides for the Big Sur coastline though this
evening.  The plume will start to shift south in earnest tonight
and round the bend of Point Conception and direct similar high
rates and overall totals of 3-5" for favored southward and
southwestward facing Transverse Mountain ranges later tonight into
tomorrow.  1-2" are possible in the lower valleys of southern
California through Tuesday, before the plume weakens and drops
south into Old Mexico, and as such a Slight Risk of Excessive Rain
is posted for tomorrow (Tuesday) for southern California

While a large amount of rain will fall along the coast, this
mid-level low also brings cold air that and will lower freezing
levels across the Sierra Nevada, where significant snows are
likely with multiple feet (3-6) possible when all is over.
Significant snows will given cross over into the Great Basin and
parts of the Northern Rockies (Idaho, SW Montana) with 1-3 feet
possible.  Travel may become impossible through mountain passes
with road closures expected.  Heavy snow will occur across the
tops of the Transverse and Peninsular ranges of southern
California, though totals are to be as extreme as further north,
Winter Storm Warnings are in effect with 3-7" with 8-24" above
8,000ft.  High Wind Warnings generally accompany the heavy snow
across the highest elevations of the Sierra Nevada and expected
across Southern Californian Ranges.

By Tuesday, the approach of the mid-level low will start to be
felt along the length east of the Rockies from Montana to New
Mexico.  A surface low will rapidly deepen across the Northern
Rockies and winds will rapidly accelerate from the south and
southwest.  This will bring in well above normal temperatures with
high temperatures into the 60s across the Central Plains and 70s
across the Southern Plains which is near records and 25-35 degrees
above normal. The low will continue to deepen quickly and slide
into the central Plains.  Winds will respond continue to
strengthen overnight and the heat will expand well into the Upper
Midwest.  Temperatures will be 35-45 degrees above normal (50s in
Midwest, 80s in southern Plains) with a vast majority of record
highs to be broken, with possibilities of record all-time December
high temperatures possible in some cities.

Along with the record temperatures, those winds will be strong
throughout the day but with occasional gusty winds.  Those winds
could be significant with 60-75 mph gusts possible at times, as
such a vast High Wind Watch is in effect from northwest Arizona to
 Colorado/New Mexico High Plains across the Central Missouri River
Valley to southeast Minnesota. The stronger winds likely to be
across the Plains, where blowing sand/dust is probable across New
Mexico, West Texas into Colorado, western Kansas/Oklahoma.  Dry
grounds and low humidity also present Elevated to Critical fire
danger, per the Storm Prediction Center across the OK/TX
panhandles for Tuesday.  This expands a bit into surrounding
Colorado, Kansas and New Mexico for Wednesday with localized
Extremely Critical fire conditions possible, which could lead to
rapid fire spread which would be highly dangerous and
life-threatening.

giJOtUwbQJ_$

FOR TUESDAY DECEMBER 21 - MONDAY DECEMBER 27: Compared to previous guidance
over the weekend, there is better agreement in the predicted 500-hPa height
anomaly fields among the dynamical models this morning. By the outset of th=
e
period, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles feature highly amplified mid-leve=
l
ridging over the North Pacific, with a broad coverage of downstream negativ=
e
height departures overspreading southern Canada. Models have been trending
towards the development of this latter mid-level feature over the past seve=
ral
days, and there is increasing confidence that this pattern transition is ti=
ed
to a robust Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) event currently situated over t=
he
western Pacific. During the period, ensemble guidance favors one or more ar=
eas
of surface high pressure shifting southward, ushering in anomalous cold air
into the northern High Plains. There is agreement between the GEFS and ECMW=
F
the forecast tools depicting a region from the western Montana to the Upper
Mississippi Valley at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling be=
low
the 15th percentile and below 0 degrees F, and a slight risk of much below
normal temperatures is issued for the entirety of week-2. Higher probabilit=
ies
(>40%) are indicated in the reforecast tools along the Canadian border regi=
on
extending from Montana to North Dakota during the middle of the period,
supporting the addition of moderate risk of much below normal temperatures
from
Dec 23 to 26 for the region.



Over the West Coast, ensembles continue to advertise the return of anomalou=
s
troughing, with the ECMWF and Canadian depicting a more amplified mean
solution, and a deeper trough axis than the GEFS. There is agreement in the
raw
multi-model ensembles indicating below-normal temperatures expanding southw=
ard
throughout parts of the Pacific Northwest, California and the Great Basin
towards the middle of the period. By day 10 (Dec 23), reforecast tools show=
 at
least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentil=
e
and below freezing, and a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
issued for much of the western CONUS from Dec 23 through the end of the per=
iod
(Dec 27). As the troughing aloft is forecast to shift eastward and amplify,
the
greater hazard risk is likely surface low pressure development and associat=
ed
enhanced onshore flow to promote widespread above-normal precipitation for
much
of the western U.S. The ECMWF reforecast is most bullish with this wet
outlook,
depicting a broad coverage of probabilities with at least a 40% chance for
3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile over the
southwestern
CONUS, and higher chances (>60%) focused over central and southern Californ=
ia.
While the GEFS reforecast tool shows a similar coverage in percentile space=
,
it
is less onboard with this heavy precipitation potential, likely tied to the
relatively weaker trough favored aloft by the middle of the period. To
reconcile these differences, a moderate risk of heavy precipitation is issu=
ed
for much of central and southern California for Dec 23-25, and a broader
slight
risk area is posted from Dec 22-27  covering the rest of the state and
adjacent
parts of Nevada. Given the increased signals for anomalous cold and enhance=
d
moisture from the Pacific, there is also an elevated potential for high
elevation snowfall in the West coast states. As supported by the latest
deterministic and ensemble mean solutions, a moderate risk of heavy snow is
posted for the Sierra Nevada's of northern and central California for Dec
23-25, and a broader slight risk area is posted extending northward into th=
e
Cascades of the Pacific Northwest from Dec 22 to 27. High elevation snowfal=
l
is
also likely further north into Washington and the Bitterroot Mountains;
however, amounts are not expected to exceed hazard thresholds at this time.
The
increase in moisture across the West during week-2 is expected to help the
ongoing drought recovery (much of California is still registering D3 to D4
conditions); however, enhanced precipitation may trigger localized flooding=
 in
the lower elevation areas and may also lead to added travel difficulties
during
the holidays.



Across the southern and eastern CONUS, persistent mid-level ridging is like=
ly
to lead to a relatively drier and warmer pattern during week-2. There are
increased signals for above-normal, possibly heavy precipitation associated
with surface low development and frontal activity originating from the Midd=
le
Mississippi Valley during the middle of the period. Although there is
agreement
in the reforecast tools showing a small region in the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys with at least a 20% of precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85=
th
percentile tied to this synoptic feature, raw uncalibrated precipitation
amounts remain fairly low at this time. Given this, and the uncertainty at
this
lead regarding the predicted storm track, no corresponding precipitation
hazards are issued, but this region will continue to be monitored in upcomi=
ng
outlooks.



Outside of the lower 48, models continue to favor broad mid-level troughing
underneath the aforementioned highly amplified ridging in the northern Paci=
fic
during week-2. This height pattern is expected to support periods of
above-normal precipitation over the central Pacific, where reforecast tools
show increased chances of precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile over parts of Hawaii early in the period. A continuation of
above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation over the Hawaii islands may
worsen already saturated soils due to antecedent rainfall over the Hawaii
islands since early December. Following an extended period of anomalous col=
d
throughout much of Alaska since November, more seasonable temperatures are
anticipated for much of the Mainland during week-2 associated with the
mid-level ridging centered to the south of the Aleutians. However, prevaili=
ng
mid-level northerly flow downstream of the ridge axis is likely to keep
temperatures on the cold side across the Alaska Panhandle. A moderate risk =
of
much below normal temperatures is posted across southern Panhandle, where
reforecast tools show at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling
below the 15th percentile and below 20 degrees (F) from Dec 23 to 26. A
broader
slight risk area is posted for nearly the entire Panhandle from Dec 22 thro=
ugh
the entirety of the period (Dec 27).

325 PM EST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 16 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 20 2021

...Overview...

A fairly progressive weather pattern is expected in the medium
range period especially in the northern stream, as an initial deep
surface low lifts quickly northward into eastern Canada, though
its trailing front could stall across parts of the central and
eastern U.S. and produce heavy rainfall late this week. A series
of troughs will make their way across the northern tier of the
U.S. during the period, while a southern stream trough may
separate from the northern prevailing flow and move slowly across
the Southwest/northern Mexico this weekend. Ridging over the
southeast quadrant of the country should get suppressed early next
week and bring temperatures closer to normal after a mild/warm
spell.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Deterministic and ensemble models for the 00/06Z cycle remain
fairly well clustered with the overall pattern described above.
Early in the period, GFS runs were slightly west of consensus
(including the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC) with their positions of the
surface low north of the Great Lakes early Thursday, so those were
not weighted as heavily. But overall a blend of the deterministic
guidance worked well for the WPC forecast, with emphasis
especially on the 00Z ECMWF. By the weekend, there are some
initially minor differences with the aforementioned possibility of
stream separation in terms of timing and whether an embedded
closed low may form, and with strength of energy within northern
stream shortwave troughs as well. No particular trend was seen
with the southern stream trough as models are waffling with the
details. In the northern stream, the 00Z CMC was notably stronger
than consensus with another shortwave tracking through the
Midwest/Great Lakes by day 5/Saturday, so weighted it less by that
point. Farther upstream, another energetic shortwave looks to dive
into the Pacific Northwest over the weekend, but questions remain
with its strength and how far south it may dive and interact with
the southern stream feature by Monday. Thus by day 6/7, the WPC
pressures/fronts forecast used about half ensemble mean guidance
(from the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC) to temper the individual model
differences. This was in good agreement with the previous WPC
forecast products.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A potent upper trough along with a strong surface low will lift
quickly northeastward through the north-central U.S. Wed into Thu,
with some lingering snow and high winds possible in the Upper
Great Lakes region Thu. Southeast of the deep low track, upper
ridging should support some record warm temperatures ahead of the
cold front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting
from the east-central U.S. to the East Thu-Sat. The trailing
portion of the front will meanwhile stall across the South, with
an axis of enhanced rainfall and potential for local runoff and
flooding/flash flooding issues from the southern Plains through
the Mid-South/Ohio Valley with return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. A developing frontal wave may also bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the Great Lakes through northern New England
into the weekend as the enhanced rainfall axis drops southward
across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling high pressure
builds across the Plains and to the East.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
325 PM EST Mon Dec 13 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 16 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 20 2021

...Overview...

A fairly progressive weather pattern is expected in the medium
range period especially in the northern stream, as an initial deep
surface low lifts quickly northward into eastern Canada, though
its trailing front could stall across parts of the central and
eastern U.S. and produce heavy rainfall late this week. A series
of troughs will make their way across the northern tier of the
U.S. during the period, while a southern stream trough may
separate from the northern prevailing flow and move slowly across
the Southwest/northern Mexico this weekend. Ridging over the
southeast quadrant of the country should get suppressed early next
week and bring temperatures closer to normal after a mild/warm
spell.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Deterministic and ensemble models for the 00/06Z cycle remain
fairly well clustered with the overall pattern described above.
Early in the period, GFS runs were slightly west of consensus
(including the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC) with their positions of the
surface low north of the Great Lakes early Thursday, so those were
not weighted as heavily. But overall a blend of the deterministic
guidance worked well for the WPC forecast, with emphasis
especially on the 00Z ECMWF. By the weekend, there are some
initially minor differences with the aforementioned possibility of
stream separation in terms of timing and whether an embedded
closed low may form, and with strength of energy within northern
stream shortwave troughs as well. No particular trend was seen
with the southern stream trough as models are waffling with the
details. In the northern stream, the 00Z CMC was notably stronger
than consensus with another shortwave tracking through the
Midwest/Great Lakes by day 5/Saturday, so weighted it less by that
point. Farther upstream, another energetic shortwave looks to dive
into the Pacific Northwest over the weekend, but questions remain
with its strength and how far south it may dive and interact with
the southern stream feature by Monday. Thus by day 6/7, the WPC
pressures/fronts forecast used about half ensemble mean guidance
(from the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC) to temper the individual model
differences. This was in good agreement with the previous WPC
forecast products.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A potent upper trough along with a strong surface low will lift
quickly northeastward through the north-central U.S. Wed into Thu,
with some lingering snow and high winds possible in the Upper
Great Lakes region Thu. Southeast of the deep low track, upper
ridging should support some record warm temperatures ahead of the
cold front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting
from the east-central U.S. to the East Thu-Sat. The trailing
portion of the front will meanwhile stall across the South, with
an axis of enhanced rainfall and potential for local runoff and
flooding/flash flooding issues from the southern Plains through
the Mid-South/Ohio Valley with return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico. A developing frontal wave may also bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the Great Lakes through northern New England
into the weekend as the enhanced rainfall axis drops southward
across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling high pressure
builds across the Plains and to the East.

Upstream, a moisture surge with moderate precipitation will work
into California and across the Northwest Thu ahead of an
approaching Pacific system. This system will gradually weaken into
Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system may then impact the
Pacific Northwest with moderate to possibly locally heavy
precipitation amounts Fri into the weekend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon December 13 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 19 - 23 2021

There is very good agreement among the dynamical models regarding the 500-h=
Pa
geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain. A very high amplitu=
de
ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over th=
e
North Pacific extending northward into the Bering Sea and western Alaska. A
trough is forecast near the Pacific coast of the CONUS by most model
solutions.
Recent Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means predict a deeper trough near to th=
e
California coast relative to the GEFS ensemble mean. Ridging and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast from parts of the Southwest across th=
e
Southern and Central Plains and much of the East.

Above normal temperatures are favored over most of Alaska under the predict=
ed
ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are
favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under
anomalous northerly flow. Below normal temperatures are likely for much of =
the
western CONUS and across the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains, under
negative 500-hPa height anomalies associated with a predicted trough. Above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Southwest, the Southern an=
d
Central Plains, and the Southeast, under a predicted ridge. GEFS temperatur=
e
forecasts favor near to below normal temperatures for parts of the Central
Mississippi Valley where the ECMWF temperature forecasts favor above normal
temperatures. Therefore, weaker probabilities of above normal temperatures =
are
indicated for this region.

Onshore southwesterly flow favors above normal precipitation for most of
Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored for the south coast =
of
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow ahead of the
ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the western third =
of
the CONUS, as well as for parts of the Northern Plains, ahead of a trough.
Near
to below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Southern and Cent=
ral
Plains northeastward into the Great Lakes region, supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for
parts of southern Texas as well as the Eastern Seaboard, supported by the
precipitation consolidation of calibrated dynamical model forecasts from th=
e
GEFS and ECMWF models.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on the circulation forecast over North America, and in
the
temperature tools, offset slightly by relatively higher uncertainty in the
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 21 - 27 2021

A similar 500-hPa flow pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is predicted=
 to
continue into week 2. The predicted ridge over the North Pacific is forecas=
t
to
retrograde westward during week 2, altering the flow over Alaska. Troughing
along the west coast of the CONUS is predicted to amplify in the week 2
period.
The ridge over the south-central and southeast CONUS is predicted to amplif=
y
slightly in the week 2 period, while mid-level heights remain near normal o=
ver
the Great Lakes and Northeast regions.

Near to above normal temperatures continue to be favored over western and
northern Alaska under the predicted ridge, with increased uncertainty as th=
e
ridge retrogresses westward. Below normal temperatures are favored for
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under anomalous
northerly
flow. Under the amplifying trough, below normal temperature probabilities a=
re
enhanced over the western CONUS and across the northern tier into the Upper
Mississippi Valley, in week 2. Probabilities exceed 60 percent for parts of
the
Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Above normal temperatures are favored
for
most of the remaining areas of the CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height
anomalies, excluding the central Great Lakes region and parts of the
Northeast,
where predicted heights are near normal.

Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored for much of the
Central and Northern Alaska Mainland in week 2. However, precipitation is
expected to decrease as the ridge retrogresses westward. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the south coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, under anomalous northerly flow. Above normal precipitation is
favored for the western third of the CONUS, with probabilities exceeding 60
percent in some areas of California and Nevada, as the trough is predicted =
to
amplify. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for much of the
Midwest, while below normal precipitation is favored for the Southern Plain=
s,
the Gulf Coast region and the Southeast, supported by the consolidation of
calibrated ECMWF and GEFS precipitation forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 5% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 30% of Toda=
y's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadia=
n
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good overall agreement on an amplified 500-hPa circulation pattern, slightl=
y
offset by some differences among temperatures and precipitation forecast
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

  * A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES. THE TIME BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS
    CAN VARY FROM 5 MINUTES TO AN HOUR. THE HAZARD MAY PERSIST
    FOR MANY HOURS OR LONGER AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE.

  * IMPACTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE SECTION OF COAST TO
    THE NEXT DUE TO LOCAL BATHYMETRY AND THE SHAPE AND ELEVATION
    OF THE SHORELINE.

  * IMPACTS CAN ALSO VARY DEPENDING UPON THE STATE OF THE TIDE AT
    THE TIME OF THE MAXIMUM TSUNAMI WAVES.

  * PERSONS CAUGHT IN THE WATER OF A TSUNAMI MAY DROWN... BE
    CRUSHED BY DEBRIS IN THE WATER... OR BE SWEPT OUT TO SEA.


NEXT UPDATE AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
A vigorous mid-level shortwave trough will quickly progress across
the Interior West today, promoting rapid deepening of a surface
low/lee trough across High Plains during the afternoon. Dry and
breezy southwesterly surface conditions will develop across the
southern High Plains, promoting some potential for wildfire spread.
15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds are expected to
coincide with widespread 20 percent RH by afternoon peak heating for
at least a couple of hours, from eastern Colorado into the Texas
Panhandle. Elevated highlights have been maintained where these
favorable conditions will overspread very dry fuels that are quite
receptive to wildfire growth. Low-end critical highlights have been
maintained across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where confidence
remains in RH dropping to 15 percent for a couple of hours.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast spread remains less than normal for
the majority of the systems of concern through the weekend,
bolstering forecast confidence. In this period, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite of best
clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS, the 12 UTC ECMWF and the
01 UTC National Blend of Models. Ensemble support is also strong
and WPC product continuity is well maintained. These models
solutions diverge more significantly early next week for Days 6/7
with the timing/amplitude of embedded systems, but most notably
with the multi-stream flow over the East/Western Atlantic where
the GFS develops a major coastal low while the ECMWF suppresses
development. 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensembles offer member
clusters in both camps. Given growing uncertainty, opted to blend
the more compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and show modest
potential for a coastal system and associated precipitation
potential to spread/develop across the region. Latest 00 UTC
guidance remains split on development potential at these longer
time frames, with similar trends.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong surface low will lift into Canada Thu. Well to the south,
upper ridging should support some record warm temperatures ahead
of the attendant cold front, with positive anomalies upwards to
15-25F shifting southward over the East to the South/Southeast
into Fri/Sat. The trailing portion of the front will meanwhile
stall and regroup from the South, with an axis of enhanced
rainfall and potential for local runoff and flooding/flash
flooding issues from the southern Plains through the
Mid-South/Ohio Valley with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico. A
developing frontal low will bring a swath of wintry precipitation
from the Great Lake states through northern New England into the
weekend as the trailing enhanced rainfall axis drops southward
across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling high pressure
builds across the Plains and to the East, These is then potential
for an aforementioned early next week East Coast system.

Upstream, a moisture surge with moderate precipitation will work
into California and across the Northwest Thu ahead of an
approaching Pacific system. This system will gradually weaken into
Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system may then impact the
Pacific Northwest with moderate to possibly locally heavy
precipitation amounts Fri into the weekend, with additional
energies digging southward over the eastern Pacific early next
week that would eventually affect CA.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast spread remains less than normal for
the majority of the systems of concern through the weekend,
bolstering forecast confidence. In this period, the WPC medium
range product suite was primarily derived from a composite of best
clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS, the 12 UTC ECMWF and the
01 UTC National Blend of Models. Ensemble support is also strong
and WPC product continuity is well maintained. These models
solutions diverge more significantly early next week for Days 6/7
with the timing/amplitude of embedded systems, but most notably
with the multi-stream flow over the East/Western Atlantic where
the GFS develops a major coastal low while the ECMWF suppresses
development. 18 UTC GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF ensembles offer member
clusters in both camps. Given growing uncertainty, opted to blend
the more compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and show modest
potential for a coastal system and associated precipitation
potential to spread/develop across the region. 00 UTC guidance
remains split on development potential at these longer time
frames, but the ECMWF has trended in support of a deep low, just
delayed. The flow offers that potential.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong surface low will lift into Canada Thu. Well to the south,
upper ridging should support some record warm temperatures ahead
of the attendant cold front, with positive anomalies upwards to
15-25F shifting southward over the East to the South/Southeast
into Fri/Sat. The trailing portion of the front will meanwhile
stall and regroup from the South, with an axis of enhanced
rainfall and potential for local runoff and flooding/flash
flooding issues from the southern Plains through the
Mid-South/Ohio Valley with return flow from the Gulf of Mexico. A
developing frontal low will bring a swath of wintry precipitation
from the Great Lake states through northern New England into the
weekend as the trailing enhanced rainfall axis drops southward
across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling high pressure
builds across the Plains and to the East. There is then potential
for an early next week East Coast system that if realized would
spread rains up the East Coast, present a maritime threat, and
even offer some Northeast snow potential.

Upstream, a moisture surge with moderate precipitation will work
into California and across the Northwest Thu ahead of an
approaching Pacific system. This system will gradually weaken into
Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system may then impact the
Pacific Northwest with moderate to possibly locally heavy
precipitation amounts Fri into the weekend, with additional
energies digging southward over the eastern Pacific early next
week that would eventually affect CA.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CST Tue Dec 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR NORTHERN PARTS OF
THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...AND PORTIONS OF
WESTERN INTO CENTRAL KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO SOUTHEAST COLORADO...FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...AND MUCH OF
WESTERN INTO CENTRAL KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
A volatile fire weather day is expected across portions of the
central Plains for tomorrow/Wednesday. A potent mid-level shortwave
trough will eject into the Plains states, with a 110+ kt mid-level
jet streak overspreading the central High Plains during the
afternoon hours. Rapid surface low intensification (perhaps to 990
mb) will ensue as the low surges towards the Upper Mississippi
Valley. Some of the latest guidance depicts a 75 kt 850 mb jet
accompanying this surface low, which will also overspread a mixing
boundary layer during the afternoon. As such, gradient flow and
downward momentum transport will encourage dangerously windy/dry
surface conditions atop extremely dry fuels, with ERCs reaching the
98th percentile in spots.

Extremely Critical highlights have been introduced for the far
northern Texas Panhandle into western and Central Kansas, where
guidance consensus depicts widespread 30+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 10-15 percent RH for at
least a few hours. Given the boundary layer mixing of the strong LLJ
winds only a few hundred feet above the ground, 45+ mph sustained
winds may occur in a few spots, especially in west-central or
southwest Kansas. Surrounding the Extremely Critical delineation,
Critical/Elevated highlights have been introduced where widespread
20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly winds are expected to overlap
with 15-20 percent RH for a few hours tomorrow afternoon.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Southern California through Wednesday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains and snow over the
Cascades and Northern Rockies...

...Critical Fire Weather risk for parts of the Southern High
Plains...

On Tuesday, a plume of moisture will stream moisture into Southern
California and then move into Mexico overnight Tuesday into
Wednesday.  The moisture will produce coastal rain and higher
elevation snow over California. The snow lingers over the Northern
Rockies and Great Basin through Wednesday.

The rain and snow will end over Southern California by Wednesday
morning. The rain will be heavy at times. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of Southern
California through Wednesday morning.  The associated heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable. The heavy
snow will end over the Pacific Northwest overnight Tuesday. The
snow will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving
conditions. A front will move onshore over the Northwest overnight
Wednesday, bringing a new round of rain and higher elevation snow
to the Pacific Northwest and Northern California on Wednesday.
Snow will expand into parts of the Northern Rockies and Great
Basin overnight Wednesday into Thursday.

Meanwhile, a developing area of low pressure over the Northern
High Plains, move eastward to the Middle Mississippi Valley by
Wednesday evening, then move into Central Ontario by Thursday.
Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees above
average over parts of the Plains into the Mississippi Valley. In
addition, many record-high temperatures are forecast over parts of
the Southern Plains into the Upper Midwest. The high temperatures
over the Southern/Central High Plains and gusty wind will produce
conditions favorable to fire weather.  Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Critical Risk Fire Weather threat across much of the
Texas panhandle Tuesday into Wednesday due to warm temperatures,
low humidity, and increased wind (15-20mph).

With warmer temperatures, moisture will start to stream northward
over the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley extending as far
north as the Great Lakes overnight Tuesday. As a result, showers
and thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley by Tuesday. In addition, overnight
Tuesday rain will begin to develop over parts of the Great Lakes
and Western Ohio Valley. Rain will expand into parts of the
Northeast by Wednesday evening, with snow developing over the
higher elevations of Northern New England. As the rain moves
eastward into Maine, cold air trapped in valleys will lead to
pockets of freezing rain by Thursday morning. Also, as the system
moves into the Upper Midwest, thunderstorms and snow will develop
over parts of the Northern Central Plains by Wednesday evening.
Overnight Wednesday, the showers and thunderstorms will increase
in intensity. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley Wednesday into Thursday morning.  The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

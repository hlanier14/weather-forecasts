Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1100 AM CDT Tue May 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...Southern Great Basin...
Only minor adjustments are needed for the Elevated risk area across
the southern Great Basin based on recent ensemble guidance.
Mid-morning observations show dry, but nearly calm conditions across
the risk area. Winds will increase by mid to late afternoon as an
upper-level trough continues to move onshore. Elevated conditions
may extend southeastward along the Mogollon Rim and into the Gila
region of southwest NM, though this will be likely be confined close
to terrain features.

...Minnesota...
Mid-morning observations across west-central to northern MN show
relative humidity values falling into the 25-40% range with winds
sustained at 15-20 mph behind a weak cold front. These trends are
falling in line with more aggressive model solutions, which hint
that at least 2-3 hours of elevated conditions are possible across
the state. The windiest/driest conditions are expected across the
southern half of MN, but rainfall in the past 24 hours has limited
fuel readiness. West-central MN may see pockets of elevated
conditions this afternoon where fuels are drier, but the spatial
extent of the threat is generally small.

..Moore.. 05/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1244 AM CDT Tue May 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move across the northern/central Great Basin
today. At the surface, a weak surface trough will develop in central
Nevada into western Utah. Elsewhere, a cold front will move across
parts of the Upper Midwest while surface high pressure will remain
entrenched in the Southeast.

...Southern Great Basing/Northwest Arizona...
A combination of increasing, but modest, mid-level winds and an
increasing surface pressure gradient will bring elevated fire
weather concerns across parts of southern Nevada, northwest Arizona,
and southwestern Utah. Winds of 15-20 mph will overlap with 5-15% RH
during the afternoon. While locally critical conditions are
possible, these will likely be terrain-driven given the weak surface
trough and the stronger mid-level winds displaced to the north and
west.

...West-central/southwest Minnesota...
Dry and windy conditions are expected behind a weak cold front.
Boundary-layer mixing could produce wind gusts near 30 mph. Portions
of west-central and southwest Minnesota have received limited
rainfall over the past week. Some locally elevated concern for fire
spread in dry grasses could develop given the potential for 20-25%
RH during the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 PM CDT Tue May 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

Recent guidance has trended towards an earlier increase in mid-level
winds across the Rockies as an upper-level trough passes through the
region. While the strongest mid-level flow is still expected after
00 UTC, 850-700 mb winds increasing to 20-30 mph within a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer should support areas of elevated
conditions across parts of the Great Basin and central New Mexico
where conditions have been dry. The driest/windiest conditions
remain most likely across northeast NM, but it is unclear if fine
fuels will dry sufficiently to support the fire weather threat.

..Moore.. 05/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Tue May 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough will approach the Southwest. While
mid-level winds will increase over a very dry (5-15% RH) airmass,
the jet core will arrive very late, beyond peak heating. A rather
weak lee trough will again enhance surface winds in parts of the
central/southern High Plains. Fuels region-wide are not particularly
receptive to fire spread currently. Only locally elevated fire
weather concerns are expected on Wednesday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Guidance from multiple models depicts a generally stable week-2
pattern over North America, with anomalous mid-level high pressure forecast
across the northwestern contiguous U.S. This pattern favors above normal
temperatures for much of the West, with some interior areas possibly reaching
excessive heat criteria early in the period. Weaker mid-level flow is forecast
downstream over the central U.S., with increased chances for above normal
precipitation across portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley.
Mid-level low pressure forecast across the North-Central Pacific favors a
wetter pattern for Alaska, but amounts are not anticipated to reach pre-
defined
hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin,
interior Pacific Northwest, and the California Central Valley, Wed, Jun 2.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Great Basin,
interior Pacific Northwest, and the California Central Valley, Wed-Thu, Jun 2-
3.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Central and Southern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Wed-Fri, Jun 2-4.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MAY 28 - TUESDAY JUNE 01:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pC5X5E6l3MPU-WQYJ-7FQM6D_-blzJGfpfUyZk9bl_UACIJ3Yt9l1CoeteUfmXPKjl8XNJ5D$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 02 - TUESDAY JUNE 08: The most prominent feature forecast
is
enhanced mid-level ridging over the western CONUS. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles all depict positive 500-hPa height anomalies building
across
portions of the northwestern CONUS later in week-1 and persisting into the
early part of week-2, which is forecast to result in a large area of
temperature anomalies greater than +10 deg F, and possibly above +20 deg F in
localized areas. The concern is that these anomalous temperatures will result
in some of the interior valleys reaching criteria for excessive heat. The GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools depict a larger area of the Northern Great Basin
having at least a 60% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile for Jun 2 relative to yesterday. Temperatures in some of the
valleys
may reach the mid-90s deg F, which would be close to daily records. Further
south along the California Central Valley, the probabilities for exceeding the
85th percentile are also increased compared to yesterday, with the GEFS
reforecast tool now depicting upwards of 60% probabilities for exceeding the
85th percentile for much of the region. Additionally, both tools show an
increased signal for maximum temperatures exceeding 100 deg F. Therefore, a
moderate risk of excessive heat is posted for portions of the Northern Great
Basin, interior Pacific Northwest, and the Central Valley of California for
Jun
2, where the tools are in good agreement, and temperatures have the highest
potential to reach hazards thresholds. The slight risk continues through Jun
3,
as the probabilities for excessive heat, while still elevated, are not as
robust as on Jun 2. Ongoing severe to extreme drought conditions across the
region are likely to exacerbate heat related impacts. The much above normal
temperatures are likely to result in expanding drought across northeast Oregon
and Idaho. The ridging is forecast to weaken by the middle of week-2, bringing
a moderation in temperatures.



Downstream of the ridge over the West, less amplified mid-level flow is
favored
across the central U.S as intermittent shortwave disturbances propagate over
the top of the ridge and through the Great Plains, resulting in decreasing
500-hPa heights. In addition, the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict weak
troughing over the Southern Rockies and Plains, which may enhance
precipitation
over the central CONUS, especially if there is any interaction with northern
stream energy. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both depict at least a 20%
chance of 3-day precipitation totals for Jun 1-3 exceeding the 85th percentile
and 1 inch across portions of the Central and Southern Plains and the Middle
and Lower Mississippi Valley, justifying a slight risk for heavy
precipitation.
Uncalibrated ECMWF guidance also shows some of these areas having at least a
40% chance for 3-day precipitation exceeding 1 inch, further supporting the
precipitation hazard. The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance has expanded the
elevated chances for heavy precipitation southward to now include much of
eastern Texas and parts of Louisiana, resulting in expansion of the heavy
precipitation hazard. This is a concerning trend due to the ongoing river
flooding in these areas. As a result, the flooding possible hazard continues
to
be highlighted over parts of eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley.



By the end of week-1, weak troughing is forecast to move into the eastern
CONUS, bringing relief from the heat expected earlier in the week. However,
this is likely a temporary reprieve as a trend toward warmer temperatures is
forecast during week-2, with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depicting at
least a 20% chance of temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile by the middle
of the period across portions of the Northeast, mid-Atlantic, and Great Lakes.
However, at this time, temperatures are generally forecast to remain below 90
deg F in most areas, precluding a related temperature hazard from being
designated.



Mid-level troughing is forecast over the North-Central Pacific, with
associated
surface low pressure depicted in the vicinity of the Aleutians. As a result,
enhanced southwesterly flow is forecast across Alaska, bringing intermittent
rounds of precipitation to the southern part of the state. However,
precipitation amounts are not expected to reach pre-defined hazardous
thresholds, and the increased cloud cover and precipitation favor near-normal
temperatures over much of the eastern Mainland and the Panhandle during
week-2.

Valid 12Z Fri May 28 2021 - 12Z Tue Jun 01 2021

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper ridging will likely build into the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a trough takes shape over the Great
Basin/Southwest. Farther east, Upper Midwest shortwave energy will
push along eastern U.S. low pressure Friday into Saturday with the
trailing front sinking southward over the eastern half of the
country. The western end of the front should linger over the
Plains while another front moves in from the west/northwest,
helping to promote episodes of showers and storms which may
contain locally heavy rainfall. The initial Upper Midwest
shortwave may combine with some energy over eastern Canada to form
an upper low over the Northeast for a brief time before lifting
northeastward. Precise effect on weather over the Northeast is
somewhat uncertain thus far. After a recent spell of warm weather
in the East and cool temperatures in the West/Northwest, the
opposite will manifest itself through the weekend into next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Recent trends in some guidance generally improved clustering
through the 00Z/06Z cycle but typical detail uncertainties remain.
Latest runs reinforce the idea that some combination of initial
Upper Mississippi Valley shortwave energy and northern stream flow
from Canada may form an upper low over the Northeast during the
weekend followed by northeastward progression as upstream flow
approaches. The 06Z GFS became a southwestern extreme for this
feature (12Z run adjusted toward consensus) while the new 12Z
UKMET is a deep extreme, corresponding to a deeper/northwest
surface wave. Trends for the trailing cold front (into the
northern Gulf of Mexico) during the weekend appear to have
stabilized for the time being. While the great majority of
guidance keeps western Atlantic frontal waviness offshore, the
lower-probability 12Z UKMET does illustrate how sensitive the
forecast for the surface evolution and amount of clouds/rain will
be to the exact strength/shape of the upper feature. The new 12Z
ECMWF adds to the uncertainty, depicting more north-south
elongation of shortwave energy near the East Coast. Over the West,
ensembles show good agreement on an upper ridge (to at least +2
sigma) building into the Pacific Northwest, downstream of
equally-as-deep troughing south of Alaska. Meanwhile for the
trough to the southeast of this ridge, recent GFS/CMC runs have
gravitated away from a West Coast closed low to the
weaker/eastward trough of ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs. The 12Z CMC is a
bit deeper than consensus though, a slight reversal from its 00Z
run.

The early portion of the updated forecast started with a blend of
the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z-00Z GFS, 00Z UKMET, and 00Z CMC in order from
more to less weight. The blend transitioned toward a model/mean
mix later in the period--by day 7 Tuesday incorporating the 00Z
ECMWF/00Z GFS (due to the 06Z GFS being slow with the Northeast
upper low) along with the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means. This approach
yielded good continuity in principle with only typical run-to-run
refinements in details.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The two primary areas of focus for rainfall during the period will
be near the exiting low pressure in the East on Friday (highest
totals likely in the northern half of the Mid-Atlantic) and then
back over the central/southern Plains to the Corn Belt along the
west end of the wavy frontal boundary and ahead of a weaker
northern stream cold front. High pressure that builds in behind
the latter front could lead to some areas of low level upslope
flow that would help to enhance convective development over the
High Plains. It will take additional time to monitor potential
overlap of heavy rainfall potential with areas that have seen
above normal rainfall over the past week or so. The West Coast
will see little to no precipitation but areas near and east of the
Great Basin to the Divide may see at least scattered showers as
the upper trough moves in and a weak cold front sinks through.

Temperatures will be cool in the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes/Northeast Friday-Saturday, expanding south down the
Mid-Atlantic Saturday with a cold air damming setup. Expect
readings to be 10-15F below normal in general but with some
pockets of highs 15-20F below normal possible from the Midwest
into the Lower Great Lakes. Warm to hot temperatures in the
Southeast on Friday (reaching 10-12F or so above normal) will
steadily cool as the cold front works down to the Gulf. The
Pacific Northwest will see a warming trend with temperatures
10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next Tuesday. This could
approach or exceed record levels for parts of Washington/Oregon
into northern California and may continue into the week beyond
this period. See the latest CPC day 6-10 forecast and 8-14 day
U.S. Hazards Outlook for more information. On the other hand the
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies will bring highs down to 10-15F
below normal by next Monday-Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 31 - JUN 04, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and ridging over the eastern
North Pacific and western North America. Downstream, a shortwave trough is
predicted over the Southwest extending into the Central Plains, and ridging
and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the eastern CONUS. The
manual blend of models forecasts positive 500-hPa height anomalies across most
of the CONUS, with stronger positive height anomalies centered over the
Pacific
Northwest under the ridge. Slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
forecast over the Southwest, associated with the shortwave trough there.
Southerly low-level surface flow is predicted into the central and eastern
CONUS, around surface high pressure over the Atlantic Ocean.

Above normal temperatures are predicted for the eastern Aleutians and western
Mainland Alaska, associated with enhanced southerly flow ahead of the
predicted
trough. Near normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle, related to onshore flow and cloud cover. Enhanced
northerly flow and negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely below
normal temperatures for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska. Probabilities
of
above normal temperatures are enhanced for the western CONUS extending
eastward
across the Northern Plains, the Great Lakes region, and northern areas of the
Northeast region, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are most favored over the southern central CONUS, as a shortwave
trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region. Below normal
temperatures are favored for the Gulf and Southeast Atlantic coasts,
consistent
with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and North Pacific and associated onshore
flow to the east lead to increased chances of above normal precipitation for
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted ridge over
the northwestern CONUS and positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the
northern tier lead to increased probabilities of near to below normal
precipitation for the West and the northern tier of the CONUS. Increased
probabilities of above normal precipitation are indicated over an area of the
southern central CONUS from the southern High Plains eastward to the Central
and Lower Mississippi Valley, ahead of a predicted shortwave trough, and
consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. Near normal is favored
for the southeastern CONUS, where precipitation tools are inconsistent.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 02 - 08 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increase. Troughing over the Aleutians deamplifies and shifts
slightly westward relative to the 6-10 day period, while above normal heights
over the eastern North Pacific broaden in extent, and flow becomes
increasingly
zonal into the western CONUS. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
northeast CONUS increase in extent and magnitude relative to the 6-10 day
period. There is increased uncertainty among model solutions on the location
of
a shortwave trough over the southern CONUS, with the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble
means predicting troughing over the central CONUS, and the Canadian ensemble
mean predicting shortwave troughing over the Southeast region. The Canadian
ensemble mean was discounted today in the manual blend of 500-hPa height
forecasts, as an outlier.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures continue to be favored for western
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, associated with enhanced mid-level
southerly
flow ahead of a predicted trough. Near normal temperatures are favored for the
remainder of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, where temperature tools
are less consistent. Above normal temperatures are favored for the western
CONUS, the Northern Plains, and northern areas of the Great Lakes and
Northeast
regions, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures
are
favored over parts of the Southern Rockies, Southern and Central Great Plains,
and parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, with predicted southerly surface
flow and enhanced precipitation, ahead of a shortwave trough traversing the
region. Below normal temperatures are also favored for the Gulf Coast and
Florida, consistent with the temperature consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, due to predicted onshore flow. Near to below normal
precipitation is likely over much of the western and northern CONUS, under
positive 500-hPa height anomalies associated with the predicted ridge. Chances
of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over a large area of the
central CONUS, from the southern High Plains to the Central and Lower
Mississippi Valley, related to potential storm systems ahead of shortwave
troughing, and anomalous southerly surface flow. Near normal precipitation is
favored for the remainder of the eastern CONUS, as indicated by the
precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and
10%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper ridging will likely build into the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a trough takes shape over the Great
Basin/Southwest. Farther east, Upper Midwest shortwave energy will
push along eastern U.S. low pressure Friday into Saturday with the
trailing front sinking southward over the eastern half of the
country. The western end of the front should linger over the
Plains while another front moves in from the west/northwest,
helping to promote episodes of showers and storms which may
contain locally heavy rainfall. The initial Upper Midwest
shortwave may combine with some energy over eastern Canada to form
an upper low over the Northeast for a brief time before lifting
northeastward. Precise effect on weather over the Northeast is
somewhat uncertain thus far. After a recent spell of warm weather
in the East and cool temperatures in the West/Northwest, the
opposite will manifest itself through the weekend into next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Recent trends in some guidance generally improved clustering
through the 00Z/06Z cycle but typical detail uncertainties remain.
Latest runs reinforce the idea that some combination of initial
Upper Mississippi Valley shortwave energy and northern stream flow
from Canada may form an upper low over the Northeast during the
weekend followed by northeastward progression as upstream flow
approaches. The 06Z GFS became a southwestern extreme for this
feature (12Z run adjusted toward consensus) while the new 12Z
UKMET is a deep extreme, corresponding to a deeper/northwest
surface wave. Trends for the trailing cold front (into the
northern Gulf of Mexico) during the weekend appear to have
stabilized for the time being. While the great majority of
guidance keeps western Atlantic frontal waviness offshore, the
lower-probability 12Z UKMET does illustrate how sensitive the
forecast for the surface evolution and amount of clouds/rain will
be to the exact strength/shape of the upper feature. The new 12Z
ECMWF adds to the uncertainty, depicting more north-south
elongation of shortwave energy near the East Coast. Over the West,
ensembles show good agreement on an upper ridge (to at least +2
sigma) building into the Pacific Northwest, downstream of
equally-as-deep troughing south of Alaska. Meanwhile for the
trough to the southeast of this ridge, recent GFS/CMC runs have
gravitated away from a West Coast closed low to the
weaker/eastward trough of ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs. The 12Z CMC is a
bit deeper than consensus though, a slight reversal from its 00Z
run.

The early portion of the updated forecast started with a blend of
the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z-00Z GFS, 00Z UKMET, and 00Z CMC in order from
more to less weight. The blend transitioned toward a model/mean
mix later in the period--by day 7 Tuesday incorporating the 00Z
ECMWF/00Z GFS (due to the 06Z GFS being slow with the Northeast
upper low) along with the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means. This approach
yielded good continuity in principle with only typical run-to-run
refinements in details.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The two primary areas of focus for rainfall during the period will
be near the exiting low pressure in the East on Friday (highest
totals likely in the northern half of the Mid-Atlantic) and then
back over the central/southern Plains to the Corn Belt along the
west end of the wavy frontal boundary and ahead of a weaker
northern stream cold front. High pressure that builds in behind
the latter front could lead to some areas of low level upslope
flow that would help to enhance convective development over the
High Plains. It will take additional time to monitor potential
overlap of heavy rainfall potential with areas that have seen
above normal rainfall over the past week or so. The West Coast
will see little to no precipitation but areas near and east of the
Great Basin to the Divide may see at least scattered showers as
the upper trough moves in and a weak cold front sinks through.

Temperatures will be cool in the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes/Northeast Friday-Saturday, expanding south down the
Mid-Atlantic Saturday with a cold air damming setup. Expect
readings to be 10-15F below normal in general but with some
pockets of highs 15-20F below normal possible from the Midwest
into the Lower Great Lakes. Warm to hot temperatures in the
Southeast on Friday (reaching 10-12F or so above normal) will
steadily cool as the cold front works down to the Gulf. The
Pacific Northwest will see a warming trend with temperatures
10-25F above normal by Memorial Day into next Tuesday. This could
approach or exceed record levels for parts of Washington/Oregon
into northern California and may continue into the week beyond
this period. See the latest CPC day 6-10 forecast and 8-14 day
U.S. Hazards Outlook for more information. On the other hand the
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies will bring highs down to 10-15F
below normal by next Monday-Tuesday.

...Showers and thunderstorms will continue across the Great Plains
and Midwest, spreading into the Northeast on Wednesday...

...A brief period of abnormally high temperatures expected along
the East Coast on Wednesday...

...A round of wet snow in the northern Rockies and North Dakota
will precede the development of more strong to severe
thunderstorms in the northern/central Great Plains and Midwest...

A deep low pressure system over south-central Canada will follow a
northeast trajectory throughout the short-range period,
intensifying as time goes on. As the trailing cold front extending
from the Great Lakes through the southern Plains propagates east
and interacts with the unstable air ahead showers and
thunderstorms are expected to develop, some of which may become
severe. Through tomorrow morning the Storm Prediction Center has
issued a slight risk of severe weather for portions of the
southern Great Plains and Upper Great Lakes, where large hail and
damaging winds will be the primary hazards of concern. The Weather
Prediction Center has also highlighted portions of east Texas and
the Lower Red River Valley as being at slight risk for excessive
rainfall and the potential for flash flooding. Overnight, showers
and thunderstorms will spread into the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic,
and Northeast regions ahead of the trailing cold front. Along with
East Coast temperatures forecast to reach double digits above
normal into the 80s and 90s on Wednesday, severe thunderstorms
capable of producing damaging wind gusts, hail, and a couple
tornadoes are expected to develop in portions of the Northeast.
Once the cold front passes through the eastern seaboard early
Thursday morning, dry conditions will persist for the remainder of
the day and temperatures will drop slightly below normal.

To the west of the Canadian low pressure system, a draping cold
front over the northern Rockies and Great Plains as well as a
developing cold front over the central Great Basin will usher in
cooler temperatures over the northern Mountains. Upslope flow
along the northern Rockies associated with these systems is
expected to bring wet snow to portions of Wyoming and Idaho early
Wednesday. As these frontal systems strengthen and propagate out
of the mountains they will serve as the impetus for more rain and
severe weather, the focus of which will be in the central Plains
where the Storm Prediction Center has issued an enhanced risk of
severe weather. As in the Northeast, the primary concerns will be
the development of damaging wind gusts, hail, and a couple
tornadoes. By Thursday morning the low pressure system and its
associated thunderstorms will push east toward the Mississippi
Valley, leaving a trail of heavy rain that may pose flooding
concerns over the central Plains and has been noted by the Weather
Prediction Center as a region where a slight risk of excessive
rainfall is possible. To the north, some wet snow may fall in
North Dakota and portions of Wisconsin on the periphery of this
system. Meanwhile, precipitation associated with the next Pacific
system is forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest early on
Thursday.

...Record highs possible in the Pacific Northwest next week...

...Heavy rain potential over portions of the Plains...


...Overview...

Upper ridging will likely build into the Pacific Northwest early
next week while a trough takes shape over the Great
Basin/Southwest. Farther east, Upper Midwest shortwave energy will
push along eastern U.S. low pressure Friday into Saturday with the
trailing front sinking well southward over the eastern half of the
country into the northern Gulf of Mexico. The western end of the
front should linger over the Plains while another front moves in
from the west/northwest, helping to promote episodes of showers
and storms which may contain locally heavy rainfall. After a
recent spell of warm weather in the East and cool temperatures in
the West/Northwest, the opposite will manifest itself through the
weekend into next week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, deterministic models offered reasonable
clustering for the first two days of the period this weekend as a
wave of low pressure exits the southern Mid-Atlantic but lingers
along a frontal boundary just off the East Coast. For the Mon-Wed
period, models diverge in the East and West with the handling of
both troughs/upper lows, so a trend toward the ensemble means was
prudent. In the East, 18Z GFS was on the slower/southwest side
with its low pressure near the New York Bight Sunday evening while
the ongoing preference/consensus has been near or just outside the
40/70 benchmark. In the West, 12Z ECMWF became quicker with the
trough (like the 12Z GFS) as it released the northern part of the
trough but allowed the southern part to close off over the Baja.
For now, preferred a simplified progression of the upper trough
via the pace of the ensemble means (18Z GEFS and 12Z ECMWF
ensemble mean) which was near the 18Z GFS. Upstream ridging into
the Pac NW (at least +2 sigma) may be squeezed by next Wednesday
as a Pacific front edges into Washington.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The main focus for rainfall during the period will be over the
central/southern Plains along the west end of the wavy frontal
boundary and ahead of a weaker northern stream cold front. High
pressure that builds in behind the latter front could lead to some
areas of low level upslope flow that would help to enhance
convective development over the High Plains. It will take
additional time to monitor potential overlap of heavy rainfall
potential with areas that have seen above normal rainfall over the
past week or so. The West Coast will see little to no
precipitation but areas near and east of the Great Basin to the
Divide may see at least scattered showers as the upper trough
moves in. Along the East Coast, offshore frontal boundary and low
pressure may only bring light showers to coastal areas but this
will depend on how the system evolves and how close it may be to
the coast. Again kept the heaviest rain offshore for now.

Temperatures will be cool in the Great
Lakes/Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Saturday with northeast winds over
most areas. Expect readings to be 10-15F below normal in general
(many areas only in the 60s). Though the cold front may dip into
the Gulf of Mexico by Sunday, this may only cool temperatures in
the Southeast to a few degrees below normal (low 80s but dew
points in the 50s to low 60s). The Pacific Northwest will see a
warming trend with temperatures 10-25F above normal by Memorial
Day into next Tue-Wed. This could approach or exceed record levels
for parts of WA/OR/ID and northern CA. On the other hand the
cloudy/stormy pattern setting up over the central/southern Plains
and eastern slopes of the Rockies will bring highs down to 10-15F
below normal by next Mon-Wed.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CDT Wed May 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move across parts of the central and
northern Rockies today. Within the southern jet stream, a weaker
shortwave trough will move into southern Arizona and New Mexico
later in the period. A weak surface trough/cold front will move into
the eastern Great Basin by the afternoon. The deepest portion of the
lee trough will be in the northern High Plains, but some extension
of lower surface pressure may reach as far south as the Colorado/New
Mexico border latitude.

...Northwest Arizona into northwest Colorado...
Ahead of the approaching weak front, southwesterly winds are
expected to increase during the day and afternoon. While areas of
15-20 mph winds will occur, it is uncertain how broad 20+ mph winds
will become across this region. The mid-level jet will generally be
over Wyoming during the afternoon and the stronger winds aloft
across Arizona and Utah will occur earlier in the day. Secondly,
high and mid-level clouds are expected for a significant portion of
the day which could limit the efficiency of momentum transfer to the
surface. That being said, the airmass will be quite dry with 5-15%
fairly common and a few other areas of 15-20%. Locally,
terrain-driven critical conditions are possible. The greater
potential for sustained critical conditions will be in northwest
Colorado where stronger mid-level winds remain even into late
afternoon.

...Central New Mexico...
A very subtle enhancement to the flow aloft will be in place during
the afternoon across parts of the Southwest. However, the main
shortwave trough and mid-level jet will not arrive until the
overnight period. With some surface pressure gradient enhancement
from a high Plains trough to the east/northeast, areas of locally
elevated to elevated conditions are possible in New Mexico. Winds of
15-20 mph are expected with 5-15% RH during the afternoon. Stronger
winds aloft will exist in northeast New Mexico and adjacent parts of
the High Plains, but fuels are less receptive there. The greatest
potential for sustained elevated conditions with at least marginally
receptive fuels will be in central New Mexico. As in the Great
Basin, high and perhaps mid-level clouds will potentially curtail
mixing of the modest winds aloft.

...Showers and thunderstorms ahead of a cold front could become

returns to the Northeast on Thursday...

...Wet snow this morning in the northern Rockies will be followed
by strong to severe thunderstorms expanding across the
north-central Plains toward the Ohio Valley...

A deep low pressure system over eastern Canada will push a cold
front across the Great Lakes today.  Heat is expected to build
along the East Coast ahead of the cold front today as high
temperatures are forecast to reach into the 80s and 90s.  The heat
will also help trigger showers and thunderstorms where the
northeastern U.S. will see to high chance for severe thunderstorms
to develop later today.  Cooler and drier weather behind the front
will then overspread the Great Lakes and the Northeast into Friday
morning.

Over the northern Rockies, wet snow this morning will gradually
taper off day as showers and thunderstorms are expected to develop
and expand south and eastward as a low pressure system deepens
over the central Plains.  The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
moderate risk of severe weather for portions of Nebraska and
Kansas today near the low track. In addition, heavy downpours from
the thunderstorms could result in areas of flash flooding.  More
strong to severe thunderstorms and heavy rains can be expected to
spread across the Midwest and into the Ohio Valley as the low
pressure system moves steadily eastward.

Meanwhile, precipitation associated with the next Pacific system
is forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest early on Thursday.
Some wet snow will again be possible in the northern Rockies by
Friday morning.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The northern stream shortwave trough will move through the central
Plains on Thursday. A much weaker southern stream shortwave trough
will continue to lose amplitude as it moves into the southern High
Plains. With the surface low tracking into the mid Missouri Valley,
the pressure pattern across the Southwest will be a bit more diffuse
than on Wednesday. What will be slightly improved is the mid-level
winds across southern New Mexico along with single digit RH values.
There, areas of 15-20 mph winds are possible. However, with the weak
surface gradient and mid/upper clouds, elevated conditions appear
that they will be relatively localized and transient.

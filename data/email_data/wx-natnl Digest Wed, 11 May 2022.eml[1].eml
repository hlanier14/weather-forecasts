Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Tue May 10 2022

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTITONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. See the prior
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 05/10/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CDT Tue May 10 2022/

...Synopsis...
A blocked upper flow regime will prevail across the CONUS today,
with a broad upper trough meandering across the western/central U.S.
as a mid-level low remains stationary off of the Atlantic Coast.
While a broad swath of low-level moisture will usher northward
across the Plains due to lee troughing, dry and windy conditions are
expected to develop across portions of the Southwest and along the
East Coast, promoting fire weather concerns.

...Southwest...
Strong, deep-layer southerly flow will persist across the Southwest
as an upper trough and associated surface low meanders around the
Four Corners region today. At the surface, dry and windy conditions
are expected across the Southwest through the afternoon, promoting
Critical wildfire-spread potential. Elevated highlights have been
introduced for areas that should see 15+ mph sustained
south-southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-20 percent RH
through the afternoon, and where fuels are at least modestly
receptive to wildfire spread. Critical highlights have also been
introduced where 20+ mph winds and RH below 15 percent will overlap
with critically dry fuels through the afternoon.

...New England...
Dry northeasterly surface winds up to 15 mph will spread across
parts of New England given the presence of a cyclone situated off of
the Atlantic coastline. By afternoon peak heating, surface RH will
drop below 30 percent over portions of southern New Hampshire into
Massachusetts and Connecticut. Fuel guidance suggests that fuels
have recently become quite receptive to wildfire spread, with
Elevated highlights introduced for areas where the aforementioned
overlapping surface winds/RH will occur, and where rainfall
accumulations have remained at/under 0.50 inches in the past 2
weeks.

...Southeast...
Surface high pressure and associated dry northerly flow will prevail
across southern Georgia into the Florida Panhandle and central
Florida Peninsula this afternoon. Guidance consensus shows RH
dipping into the 20-35 percent range by afternoon peak heating,
where the latest forecast fuel guidance shows ERCs in the 80-95th
percentile range. However, surface winds are expected to be weak
overall (barely reaching 10 mph in several locales), hence the
withholding of fire weather highlights. Nonetheless, at least
localized wildfire-spread concerns will exist wherever gusty winds
may develop.

ion
of favored above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation is like=
ly
to exacerbate drought conditions and sustain an elevated wildfire risk acro=
ss
the southern High Plains. Springtime flooding remains a concern along the R=
ed
River of the North and across central and eastern Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 18 - TUESDAY MAY 24: Late in week-1, there is good agreem=
ent
between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble forecasts of the 500-hPa height pattern
which continues to feature amplified ridging overspreading the western U.S.
with downstream troughing across northeastern CONUS. There still remains so=
me
question as to how much of the cut-off low energy that is favored to linger
over the Southeast phases in with this troughing further north, However,
confidence remains high on the prospect of well above-normal, and possibly
near
breaking maximum temperatures (as supported by the National Blend of Models=
)
persisting into early week-2 throughout the southwestern and south-central
CONUS tied to the mid-level ridging. During the first several days of the
period, the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles maintain much of the anomalous ridging
but
favor a flattening of this feature across the southern tier of the U.S. in
conjunction with another mid-level trough developing upstream and shifting
into
the Pacific Northwest. Compared to the 0z GEFS, the 0z ECMWF has become mor=
e
robust with this mid-level feature, suggesting a cooler pattern potentially
emerging across the West resulting in some remediation to the anomalous war=
mth
favored across portions of the southern tier of the CONUS later in the peri=
od.



Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally depict a broad area acro=
ss
the southern CONUS with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding
the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F (90 degrees in the higher elevations o=
f
the West) throughout the period to support the continuation of a slight ris=
k
of
excessive heat for the entirety of week-2. Relative to previous reforecast
guidance, there are reduced signals for maximum temperatures exceeding haza=
rds
criteria across California and the Desert Southwest, and conversely, an upt=
ick
in the signals across parts of the southeastern U.S. Given these trends, th=
e
Desert Southwest is no longer included in the moderate risk of excessive he=
at,
and an eastward expansion of the slight risk area for excessive heat is mad=
e
across the southern tier of the CONUS in today's outlook. In the Southern
Plains, both reforecast tools maintain at least a 40% chance for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, with higher probabilities (>60%=
)
focused across central Texas to support the continuation of a moderate risk
and
high risk of excessive heat for May 18-20 and May 18-19, respectively. Some
adjustments are made along the northern periphery of these areas in today's
outlook. This elevated potential for excessive heat continues to be further
supported by uncalibrated temperature guidance, as well as the National Ble=
nd
of Models analysis depicting several locations approaching near record
breaking
temperatures (>100 degrees F in parts of Texas) early in the period.



In addition to the anomalous warmth expected throughout the southwestern
CONUS,
strengthening pressure gradients are favored in the ensembles, and reforeca=
st
tools maintain areas of increased likelihood of wind speeds exceeding the 8=
5th
percentile through the middle of the period. Thus, a slight risk of high wi=
nds
remains designated for May 18-22. The continued potential for high winds is
likely to sustain an elevated wildfire risk during the outlook period acros=
s
the southwestern quarter of the CONUS. Currently, multiple large wildfires =
are
burning throughout the Four Corners region and Southern Plains. The largest
wildfire incident is the Calf Canyon fire located east of Santa Fe, which h=
as
burned over 200,000 acres (as of May 10) with less than half containment.
Drier than normal conditions are favored to accompany the anomalous warmth
during the next two weeks, which is expected to worsen drought conditions
throughout much of the southwestern CONUS, raising concern for rapid onset
drought for parts of eastern Texas. Thus, a rapid onset drought area remain=
s
posted over eastern Texas, where near record heat and little to no
precipitation is favored during the next two weeks.



While above-normal temperatures are predominately favored throughout the
southern CONUS, there are stronger signals anomalous cold developing in the
Pacific Northwest associated with the aforementioned troughing moving into =
the
region. Despite differences in the mid-level pattern among the ensembles,
there
is good agreement in the reforecast tools depicting at least a 20% chance o=
f
nighttime minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below
freezing over many parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and western Montana.
Thus, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for May 18-=
20.
The coldest temperatures are expected in the highest elevations, however an=
y
frost and/or freezes in the lower elevations may lead to adverse impacts as
sub-freezing temperatures would be considered fairly late for this time of =
the
year in the region.



For precipitation, there is better agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles
favoring mean surface low pressure early in the period over the central CON=
US.
Compared to yesterday, this surface feature is showing stronger signs of
deepening in the ECMWF ensemble, with a good return flow setup from the Gul=
f
of
Mexico to promote increased precipitation amounts over portions of the
Mississippi Valley. This is reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool indicati=
ng
at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1 inch across the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley during
the
middle of the period. However, this heavy precipitation potential is much l=
ess
supported in the GEFS and the Canadian guidance. Given the novelty of this
potential in the ECMWF solutions, no corresponding heavy precipitation haza=
rds
are posted. Across the Pacific Northwest, increased onshore flow is favored=
 to
bring wetter than normal conditions to the region during week-2. While ther=
e
continues to be increased signals in the ECMWF reforecast tool (tied to the
aforementioned stronger troughing favored aloft) for 3-day amounts exceedin=
g
the 85th percentile in the region during the middle of the period, totals a=
re
still not expected to reach hazard thresholds, precluding a corresponding
hazard.



Across the tropics, there continues to be good model support for a
convectively
coupled Kelvin wave aloft traversing the western Hemisphere during week-2,
which is conducive for possible early season tropical cyclone formation.
Notably, both the 0z and 6z GEFS ensemble members show several low pressure
centers tracking northward in the Caribbean, resulting in enhanced
precipitation amounts in the daily ensemble means throughout the region dur=
ing
mid to late week-2. While this is suggestive of the first signs of tropical
cyclone development in the Atlantic for the season, no precipitation relate=
d
hazards are posted given that these solutions remain isolated to one model =
and
general uncertainty at this lead. However, any potential tropical developme=
nts
and consensus among the models will be addressed in subsequent week-2 U.S.
hazards outlooks as well as in CPC's Global Tropics Hazards Outlook at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/C=

XvliMi4ATws5fTiLlepkiluyGsAHOxnhR6yDeE_-4KPLfrl5-EiY$



Flooding is likely to persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of =
the
North, and extending into part of the James River basin due to ongoing
snowmelt
and above-normal precipitation favored during week-1. Across Alaska,
below-normal temperatures are predominately favored throughout much of the
Mainland. Although anomalously cold temperatures may slow the rate of
springtime snowmelt and ice-river breakup, a possible flood hazard is
maintained for much of the central and eastern Mainland.

...Lingering blocky pattern to extend record heat from the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast
late week along with episodes of central U.S. convection and an
emerging onshore rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while heat persists eastward over far
southern tier areas...


...Overview...

The blocky large scale pattern over the short range period will
persist through the early medium range period with an upper low
retrograding over the southeastern U.S. with ridging atop the low,
while upper troughing across the western U.S. gradually gives way
to higher heights. The pattern should transition toward an eastern
Pacific trough, western U.S. into High Plains ridge, and eastern
U.S. trough early next week. A broad area of much above normal
temperatures into late this week from the southern Plains into
Great Lakes/Northeast, with numerous daily records possible, will
eventually moderate over the northern two-thirds of the country as
a wavy front over the Plains (a possible focus for at least some
locally heavy rainfall) pushes farther eastward ahead of the
approaching trough. Meanwhile an upper low reaching the Southeast
by Friday will quickly open up as it lifts northward, spreading
rainfall into and north from the Carolinas. The upper ridge
building into/through the West will moderate initially chilly
temperatures over the Northwest while bringing a period of very
warm to hot weather across the southern half of the West Saturday
onward, connecting with the heat expected to persist over and near
the southern Plains. Highs may challenge daily records over some
locations across these areas.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement with
the overall pattern described above, but with lingering
differences in the smaller scale details. One such smaller-scale
feature is a shortwave located over the Pacific Northwest early
Friday that tracks eastward to potentially join or at least
interact with a small upper low forming over south-central Canada
near the U.S. border by Saturday. Even for the end of this week,
the shortwave variations lead to differences in the QPF over the
Pacific Northwest (which this updated forecast trended a bit
heavier with) and a surface low pressure system. The 00Z CMC
especially and to some extent the UKMET continued to be a bit
deeper with the shortwave feature than the GFS and ECMWF runs and
the bulk of ensemble members. Going forward into early next week,
the depth of the 00Z CMC leads to a farther south and slower upper
low. The newer 12Z CMC seems to be trending somewhat closer to
consensus.

Other aspects of the forecast agree fairly well in principle as an
upper high grows its ridging influence across parts of the
southwestern and south-central U.S. early next week, while
troughing is likely across the Northwest though again with some
detail differences. Thus the WPC forecast began with a blend of
the (latest available) 00Z ECMWF and 00Z/06Z deterministic GFS
runs with smaller portions of the 00Z UKMET and CMC, phasing out
the latter models as the period progressed in favor of the GEFS
and EC ensemble means.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Within the broad area of above normal temperatures from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes and Northeast on Friday, the
best potential for some daily records will be across the southern
tier and Great Lakes/Northeast. Highest anomalies of plus 10-20F
or slightly higher should be across northern areas from Friday
into the weekend. Meanwhile potential record heat could persist
over/near eastern Texas into next week, and may expand over more
of the southern Plains/South early next week, with temperatures
well into the 90s and 100s in some areas.

The ridge building over the West will lead to a pronounced warming
trend during the weekend, with broad coverage of highs 10-15F
above normal over the southern half of the region on Saturday into
Sunday and persisting into Tuesday. This heat could challenge
daily record highs over some southern areas and ultimately
increase temperatures over the southern Plains once again next
week. The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be chilly on
Friday with highs 5-15F below normal, followed by some moderation.
Shortwaves ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough and
associated surface fronts may produce multiple episodes of
precipitation over the Northwest. Some of this activity could be
locally moderate/heavy depending on exact details that have low
predictability at this time.

Moisture streaming in ahead of a couple of frontal systems could
bring moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms over or just
west of the Mississippi Valley late this week. The fronts should
consolidate and become more progressive as upper troughing heads
toward and into the East. Some rainfall along the front could
still be fairly intense but the greater progression may temper
maximum totals over the East. The trailing part of the front
should stall and may lift back as a warm front early next week,
potentially serving as a focus for some convection. The Southeast
upper low that quickly opens up Friday into Saturday will spread
an area of rain into the Carolinas and areas to the north. Some
localized enhancement will be possible over the Carolinas/Virginia
but rapid opening of the upper low should tend to decrease the
focus of moisture farther northward.

the southern Plains. Highs may challenge daily records over some
locations across these areas.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement with
the overall pattern described above, but with lingering
differences in the smaller scale details. One such smaller-scale
feature is a shortwave located over the Pacific Northwest early
Friday that tracks eastward to potentially join or at least
interact with a small upper low forming over south-central Canada
near the U.S. border by Saturday. Even for the end of this week,
the shortwave variations lead to differences in the QPF over the
Pacific Northwest (which this updated forecast trended a bit
heavier with) and a surface low pressure system. The 00Z CMC
especially and to some extent the UKMET continued to be a bit
deeper with the shortwave feature than the GFS and ECMWF runs and
the bulk of ensemble members. Going forward into early next week,
the depth of the 00Z CMC leads to a farther south and slower upper
low. The newer 12Z CMC seems to be trending somewhat closer to
consensus.

Other aspects of the forecast agree fairly well in principle as an
upper high grows its ridging influence across parts of the
southwestern and south-central U.S. early next week, while
troughing is likely across the Northwest though again with some
detail differences. Thus the WPC forecast began with a blend of
the (latest available) 00Z ECMWF and 00Z/06Z deterministic GFS
runs with smaller portions of the 00Z UKMET and CMC, phasing out
the latter models as the period progressed in favor of the GEFS
and EC ensemble means.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Within the broad area of above normal temperatures from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes and Northeast on Friday, the
best potential for some daily records will be across the southern
tier and Great Lakes/Northeast. Highest anomalies of plus 10-20F
or slightly higher should be across northern areas from Friday
into the weekend. Meanwhile potential record heat could persist
over/near eastern Texas into next week, and may expand over more
of the southern Plains/South early next week, with temperatures
well into the 90s and 100s in some areas.

The ridge building over the West will lead to a pronounced warming
trend during the weekend, with broad coverage of highs 10-15F
above normal over the southern half of the region on Saturday into
Sunday and persisting into Tuesday. This heat could challenge
daily record highs over some southern areas and ultimately
increase temperatures over the southern Plains once again next
week. The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be chilly on
Friday with highs 5-15F below normal, followed by some moderation.
Shortwaves ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough and
associated surface fronts may produce multiple episodes of
precipitation over the Northwest. Some of this activity could be
locally moderate/heavy depending on exact details that have low
predictability at this time.

Moisture streaming in ahead of a couple of frontal systems could
bring moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms over or just
west of the Mississippi Valley late this week. The fronts should
consolidate and become more progressive as upper troughing heads
toward and into the East. Some rainfall along the front could
still be fairly intense but the greater progression may temper
maximum totals over the East. The trailing part of the front
should stall and may lift back as a warm front early next week,
potentially serving as a focus for some convection. The Southeast
upper low that quickly opens up Friday into Saturday will spread
an area of rain into the Carolinas and areas to the north. Some
localized enhancement will be possible over the Carolinas/Virginia
but rapid opening of the upper low should tend to decrease the
focus of moisture farther northward.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0225 PM CDT Tue May 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND HIGH
PLAINS....

...High Plains...
Overall the forecast remains valid with a few minor adjustments. The
eastern edge of the Critical area was trimmed westward away from a
diffuse dryline where high surface moisture is likely to limit the
potential for prolonged critical humidity. Thunderstorm development
is expected near and east of this dryline across portions of eastern
NM later in the afternoon. Model soundings show a mixed wet/dry mode
is likely. While not overly dry, enough storm coverage likely exists
for isolated dry strikes outside of the wettest cores atop very dry
fuels. As such a small area of IsoDryT has been added from eastern
NM and far southwest TX.

...Florida...
Across the western Florida Peninsula, dry northeasterly winds are
expected through much of the afternoon. Hi-res ensemble guidance has
come into better agreement on the coverage of 10-15 mph surface
winds across much of the region. While not overly robust, occasional
gusts to near 20 mph, humidity below 30% and abnormally dry fuels
may support a few hours of elevated fire weather potential across
the western Peninsula. A small Elevated area has been added to
account for this.

..Lyons.. 05/10/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Tue May 10 2022/

...Synopsis...
Surface-low intensification is expected around the Four Corners as
the upper trough ejects eastward and overspreads the Rockies
tomorrow/Wednesday. 15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
will coincide with 10-15 percent RH by afternoon as the boundary
layer mixes, promoting at least Elevated conditions for wildfire
spread across the Southwest. Critical highlights have also been
introduced where the strongest winds/lowest RH overlap for several
hours atop critically dry fuels Wednesday afternoon.

Dry northerly flow will continue across the Florida Peninsula
tomorrow as a surface low meanders off of the Atlantic Coast. Latest
guidance consensus shows RH dropping below 30 percent by afternoon
peak heating, with some guidance members showing surface winds
reaching 15 mph at times. Confidence is not quite high enough to
introduce Elevated highlights, given the lack of upper support to
force a stronger low-level wind field. If guidance continues to
depict more widespread 15 mph winds in later guidance, future
outlooks may include Elevated highlights for the western half of the
Florida Peninsula.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 10 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 16 - 20 2022

All models show a de-amplifying mid-level 500-hPa anomaly pattern over the
course of the 6 to 10 day period. The European operational model and the EC=
MWF
ensemble mean are slower to de-amplify the pattern, but have moved closer t=
o
the more zonal solution of the other models and ensembles. The GEFS mean, G=
FS
Superensemble, and the 0z operational GFS show quicker de-amplification, an=
d
so
a less amplified mean mid-level pattern, with largely zonal flow and slight=
ly
above-normal 500-hPa heights across the CONUS. These models, however, maint=
ain
slightly larger anomalies for the period as a whole than yesterday. A flat
anomalous 500-hPa ridge persists through the period across the southern tie=
r
of
the CONUS, especially in central and western sections of the country. To th=
e
east, models hold a modest mid-level trough across the Great Lakes region. =
The
Canadian ensemble mean shows a relatively amplified solution, with negative
500-hPa height anomalies extending farther south and east into the lower Oh=
io
Valley and upper Southeast. The GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean patterns
keep
subnormal 500-hPa heights confined to the Great Lakes and adjacent areas.
Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook favors the less amplified solutio=
n, but the Canadian
ensemble
mean can=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt be discounted completely given a sligh=
t trend toward more
amplification in most other models, except the European operational and
ensemble mean.

Models generally agree that the period will start with a strong ridge
southwest
of Alaska, a lesser ridge over the western CONUS, some degree of troughing
from
the northern Great Plains into the Great Lakes region and northern Ohio
Valley,
and a fairly weakening ridge across eastern Canada and the northeast CONUS.
This forecast pattern results in enhanced chances for above-normal
temperatures
in the Northeast, across the southern tier of the country, and in central
sections of the Rockies and Intermountain West. A significant early-season
heat
wave will affect areas from the eastern Great Basin and Southwest through t=
he
southern Great Plains and lower Mississippi Valley, with high temperatures =
at
or near record levels possible. Re-forecast tools from both the GEFS and th=
e
European ensembles show temperatures averaging over 10 deg. F above normal =
for
the period in much of the southern Great Plains. Toward the end of the peri=
od,
the de-amplifying pattern will confine excessive heat to the southern tier =
of
the CONUS as conditions ease farther north. Meanwhile, fairly weak troughin=
g
southwest of Canada and over parts of the northern Great Plains, Great Lake=
s
region, and part of the northern Ohio Valley enhances the chances for
subnormal
average temperatures there, though not as strongly as the warmth is favored
farther south.

Elevated chances for drier than normal conditions will exist near and
downstream of the western CONUS ridge across most of the southern CONUS.
Slightly increased chances for above normal precipitation precipitation are
indicated for the Pacific Northwest and the northeastern CONUS, near or
downstream from mean mid-level troughs.

The strong ridge southwest of Alaska is forecast by all models to deteriora=
te
much more slowly than yesterday, but this will not bring a dramatic change =
in
sensible weather from yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook. Slight=
ly enhanced odds for above
normal temperatures and below normal precipitation cover much of the
southwestern part of the Mainland, with enhanced chances for cool, wet
conditions farther north and east.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of
Today's operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's 0z European
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is below
average, 2 out of 5, because of uncertainties in the evolution of the
de-amplifying pattern, and model differences in the eastern CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 18 - 24 2022

There is general model agreement on continued zonal mid-level flow that beg=
an
during the 6 to 10 day period, but models maintain slightly more amplificat=
ion
than yesterday. Somewhat above-normal 500-hPa heights in the south-central =
and
southwestern CONUS should persist through the period, and may increase
slightly
toward the end of week-2. The European ensemble mean remains more amplified
than Canadian ensembles and GEFS but have shifted toward the more zonal
solution of the other models. Farther east there is greater uncertainty, wi=
th
both the Canadian and European ensemble means showing a deeper trough into =
the
Great Lakes Region and Northeast than the GEFS. The GEFS remains the least
amplified of the ensembles, but mid-level height anomalies are slightly lar=
ger
than shown yesterday.

The mid-level flow will keep unseasonably hot weather out of the northern t=
ier
of states, but the early-season heatwave will likely continue in parts of t=
he
southern CONUS, most significantly over the southern Great Plains. The
slightly
more-amplified solution favored today than yesterday should keep hot and dr=
y
weather in place longer than initially expected, delaying significant relie=
f
from the heat in the southern Great Plains. Meanwhile, elevated chances for
cooler than normal conditions cover much of the Great Lakes Region westward=
 to
the Pacific Northwest. Farther east, model discrepancies, particularly
regarding the nature of the mid-level trough centered over the Great Lakes
Region,  preclude any significant tilt of the odds toward extremes of
temperature for the Northeast or for precipitation across most areas east o=
f
the Mississippi River. However, better model consensus keeps some increased
chances for above-normal precipitation in parts of the Great Lakes Region, =
and
for drier than normal conditions in the lower Northeast and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.

Mainland Alaska continues to have slightly increased chances for warmer tha=
n
normal conditions in southwestern sections, with subnormal temperatures
favored
farther to the northeast.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, a=
nd
30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is lower t=
han
normal, 2 out of 5, because of the uncertainties inherent in the magnitude =
and
particularly the location of anomalous temperature and precipitation in an
unusually zonal mid-level pattern. But the model consensus gives more
confidence in the hot, dry conditions favored over the Great Plains and som=
e
other parts of the southern tier of the CONUS.


FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Summer-like heat will expand northward through much of the
Midwest and Northeast; critical fire danger persists from the
Southwest to the High Plains...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms forecast for the Midwest as
well as the Southern High Plains...

...Cool temperatures and scattered low elevation rain/high
elevation snow persist over the western U.S., with heavier
precipitation forecast for the Northwest Thursday...

...Surface low over the Atlantic to keep temperatures cool and
result in high surf along the East Coast...

As an upper level ridge continues to build over the Mississippi
Valley this week, summer-like heat over the Heartland today will
expand further north into the Midwest and Interior Northeast
Wednesday and Thursday. Widespread, well above average high
temperatures are forecast, with some locations up to 30 degrees
above average across the Middle Missouri and Upper Mississippi
Valleys. Record high temperatures into the 90s are forecast from
eastern portions of the Plains into the Lower and Middle Missouri
and Mississippi Valleys. Farther west, the combination of heat,
dry conditions, and gusty winds will continue to result in an
extensive area of Elevated to Critical fire weather risk as
outlined by the Storm Prediction Center from the Four-Corners
region to the Central and Southern High Plains Wednesday. Red Flag
Warnings are also in effect across the area. This risk will remain
for portions of the Central and Southern High Plains Thursday as
gusty winds continue along a dry line in the lee of the Rockies
and a cold front approaches from the west.

Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms are also forecast from the
Midwest to the Southern High Plains ahead of a strengthening storm
system. There is a Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall
for portions of the Upper Missouri and Mississippi Valleys
Wednesday as deep moisture along a warm front lifting northward
across the region will lead to efficient, heavy rain producing
storms. In addition, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) for severe thunderstorms for both this
region as well as the Southern High Plains. Large hail, gusty
winds, and a couple tornadoes are possible for the northern risk
area while large hail will be the main risk for the Southern High
Plains. The risk for severe thunderstorms will be higher Thursday
as a surface low deepens and moves into the Northern Plains. There
is an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) across a larger portion of the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest with high CAPE contributing to
robust thunderstorm development and the potential for large hail,
gusty winds, and tornadoes. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall
has also been issued as deep moisture remains in place along the
warm front, continuing to promote heavy rain rates. Storms may
also have a tendency to backbuild and move over the same
locations, leading to areal average rain totals of a couple
inches, and potentially significantly higher in areas that see
continuous storms.

A deep upper level trough is set to keep anomalously colder
temperatures entrenched throughout the western part of the
country. In contrast to the central and eastern U.S., forecast
highs will remain 10 to 20 degrees below normal from the Desert
Southwest north through the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest
Wednesday. Temperatures will moderate a bit further south on
Thursday, but continue to be well below normal for the Pacific
Northwest as a Pacific storm system approaches. Frost and freeze
related advisories continue for portions of coastal northern
California and southern Oregon as well as interior portions of
Washington state. Scattered low elevation rain/high elevation snow
showers will continue in the vicinity of a cold front slowly
meandering through the Rockies and Great Basin on Wednesday.
Heavier precipitation is forecast to expand over the Pacific
Northwest from the coast inland Wednesday night into Thursday as
the Pacific storm system moves in.

A lingering surface low over the Atlantic will continue to aid in
funneling cool northerly flow down the East Coast, keeping much of
the I-95 corridor on east to the coast feeling quite cool by
mid-May standards.  Some parts of the coast, from New England on
south to the North Carolina Outer Banks, will struggle to get out
of the 60s for highs on Wednesday.  These same areas are also
contending with high surf which has led to the issuance of Coastal
Flood Warnings and Advisories for portions of the Mid-Atlantic
coast.  Temperatures will rebound to warmer levels in New England
on Thursday with much of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic eventually
returning to more seasonal temperature levels by the second half
of the week.

...Lingering blocky pattern to extend record heat from the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast
late week along with episodes of central U.S. convection and an
emerging onshore rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while heat persists eastward over far
southern tier areas...


...Overview...

The blocky large scale pattern over the short range period will
persist through the early medium range period with an upper low
retrograding over the southeastern U.S. with ridging atop the low,
while upper troughing across the western U.S. gradually gives way
to higher heights. The pattern should transition toward an eastern
Pacific trough, western U.S. into High Plains ridge, and eastern
U.S. trough early next week. A broad area of much above normal
temperatures into late this week from the southern Plains into
Great Lakes/Northeast, with numerous daily records possible, will
eventually moderate over the northern two-thirds of the country as
a wavy front over the Plains (a possible focus for at least some
locally heavy rainfall) pushes farther eastward ahead of the
approaching trough. Meanwhile an upper low reaching the Southeast
by Friday will quickly open up as it lifts northward, spreading
rainfall into and north from the Carolinas. The upper ridge
building into/through the West will moderate initially chilly
temperatures over the Northwest while bringing a period of very
warm to hot weather across the southern half of the West Saturday
onward, connecting with the heat expected to persist over and near
the southern Plains. Highs may challenge daily records over some
locations across these areas.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement with
the overall pattern described above, but with lingering
differences in the smaller scale details. One such smaller-scale
feature is a shortwave located over the Pacific Northwest early
Friday that tracks eastward to potentially join or at least
interact with a small upper low forming over south-central Canada
near the U.S. border by Saturday. Even for the end of this week,
the shortwave variations lead to differences in the QPF over the
Pacific Northwest (which this updated forecast trended a bit
heavier with) and a surface low pressure system. The 00Z CMC
especially and to some extent the UKMET continued to be a bit
deeper with the shortwave feature than the GFS and ECMWF runs and
the bulk of ensemble members. Going forward into early next week,
the depth of the 00Z CMC leads to a farther south and slower upper
low. The newer 12Z CMC seems to be trending somewhat closer to
consensus.

Other aspects of the forecast agree fairly well in principle as an
upper high grows its ridging influence across parts of the
southwestern and south-central U.S. early next week, while
troughing is likely across the Northwest though again with some
detail differences. Thus the WPC forecast began with a blend of
the (latest available) 00Z ECMWF and 00Z/06Z deterministic GFS
runs with smaller portions of the 00Z UKMET and CMC, phasing out
the latter models as the period progressed in favor of the GEFS
and EC ensemble means.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Within the broad area of above normal temperatures from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes and Northeast on Friday, the
best potential for some daily records will be across the southern
tier and Great Lakes/Northeast. Highest anomalies of plus 10-20F
or slightly higher should be across northern areas from Friday
into the weekend. Meanwhile potential record heat could persist
over/near eastern Texas into next week, and may expand over more
of the southern Plains/South early next week, with temperatures
well into the 90s and 100s in some areas.

The ridge building over the West will lead to a pronounced warming
trend during the weekend, with broad coverage of highs 10-15F
above normal over the southern half of the region on Saturday into
Sunday and persisting into Tuesday. This heat could challenge
daily record highs over some southern areas and ultimately
increase temperatures over the southern Plains once again next
week. The Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be chilly on
Friday with highs 5-15F below normal, followed by some moderation.
Shortwaves ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough and
associated surface fronts may produce multiple episodes of
precipitation over the Northwest. Some of this activity could be
locally moderate/heavy depending on exact details that have low
predictability at this time.

Moisture streaming in ahead of a couple of frontal systems could
bring moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms over or just
west of the Mississippi Valley late this week. The fronts should
consolidate and become more progressive as upper troughing heads
toward and into the East. Some rainfall along the front could
still be fairly intense but the greater progression may temper
maximum totals over the East. The trailing part of the front
should stall and may lift back as a warm front early next week,
potentially serving as a focus for some convection. The Southeast
upper low that quickly opens up Friday into Saturday will spread
an area of rain into the Carolinas and areas to the north. Some
localized enhancement will be possible over the Carolinas/Virginia
but rapid opening of the upper low should tend to decrease the
focus of moisture farther northward.

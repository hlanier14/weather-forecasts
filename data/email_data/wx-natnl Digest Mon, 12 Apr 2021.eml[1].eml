Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...Southwest U.S. into the southern High Plains...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected to develop this
afternoon with gusty northwesterly winds. Overall flow will be
rather modest and decreasing with western extent but widespread
humidity below 15% will be more than supportive of fire weather
potential given dry fuels from the ongoing drought. Locally critical
conditions may also develop across the terrain favored areas of the
Southwest into southern Colorado. A local extension of the Elevated
into southern Colorado has been made with some trimming of the area
on the western edge across central Arizona. The forecast Elevated
area across the central High Plains remains on track with only minor
changes.

..Lyons.. 04/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level cutoff low and associated surface lee trough will
continue to slowly move east across the eastern CONUS, promoting
moist conditions ahead of a cold front, and limiting wildfire-spread
potential to a degree. Across the western into the central U.S.,
relatively zonal upper flow will prevail, though an embedded
mid-level impulse is expected to rapidly eject into the central
Plains, with a southward-surging cold front expected. Deep-layer
westerly flow will promote dry and breezy conditions across the
southwest U.S. into the southern High Plains, with briefly dry and
breezy conditions also accompanying the post-cold-frontal
environment across the central High Plains.

...Southwest U.S. into the southern High Plains...
While mid-level wind speeds are expected to be modest, ample diurnal
heating is expected to encourage strong enough downward momentum
transport and downslope flow to promote widespread 15-20 mph
sustained westerly surface winds across portions of the Four Corners
region into the southern High Plains. An Elevated area has been
maintained where fuels are most receptive to fire spread, and where
RH is expected to drop below 15% for several hours during the
afternoon. A few of the more terrain-favoring locations may also
experience brief, locally Critical conditions around afternoon peak
heating.

...Central High Plains...
The cold front is expected to surge southeast across portions of
eastern Colorado into central Nebraska during the afternoon hours.
While guidance still varies regarding how low minimum RH will get,
guidance consensus suggests that RH may remain at or below 20%
immediately behind the cold front for up to 3 hours, when 15-25 mph
northwesterly surface winds are expected. Given a moderate to severe
drought across the area, fuels should be at least marginally
receptive to some fire spread despite green-up and some recent light
precipitation accumulations, prompting the introduction of an
Elevated area.

...North-Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat Midweek...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Wednesday with a deep closed low
over the Great Lakes, which pushes a cold front/deepening surface
low off the East Coast by Thursday/Friday. Models/ensembles
(especially the 00z ECMWF) are trending towards a more
amplified/less progressive solution, and show relatively good
agreement through much of the period with this feature. Meanwhile,
out West, a closed low will settle over the Great Basin region
during the middle of the week before a building ridge over the
West Coast/western Canada acts to push the energy eastward into
the Plains by next weekend. The models show good agreement the
first half of the period, but begin to diverge with the details of
energy ejection days 5-7. A solution close to that of the ensemble
means should help to mitigate these detail differences.

This cycle of the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a majority blend of the deterministic models
(GFS/ECMWF/CMC) through day 5, quickly increasing the weighting of
the ensemble means thereafter. This maintains overall good WPC
continuity, with one exception being a slower/farther west cold
front progression off the East Coast days 3-4, consistent with the
latest model trends.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Combination closed low held over the West and lead cold Canadian
High Pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below normal)
sets the stage for a potentially heavy upslope snow event over the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains through midweek. Some
deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation is also possible
over the Great Basin. Confidence is increasing on a moderate rain
focus shifting into the Plains Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary will settle/linger this week
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and focus periods of moderate to
heavy rains over the Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southern Plains through the entire period. Amounts don't
look very high, but the Central Gulf Coast states have had much
above normal rainfall recently, so there may be flooding concerns.

Farther north, guidance has noticeably trended upward with respect
to rainfall across parts of the East Coast/Northeast
Thursday-Friday. Some models suggest moderate to locally heavy
rainfall to accompany the cold front/surface low as it traverses
the region. Coastal low genesis may also present some
maritime/coastal threats across New England late week/next
weekend.

...North-Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat Midweek...

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period begins Wednesday with a deep closed low
over the Great Lakes, which pushes a cold front/deepening surface
low off the East Coast by Thursday/Friday. Models/ensembles
(especially the 00z ECMWF) are trending towards a more
amplified/less progressive solution, and show relatively good
agreement through much of the period with this feature. Meanwhile,
out West, a closed low will settle over the Great Basin region
during the middle of the week before a building ridge over the
West Coast/western Canada acts to push the energy eastward into
the Plains by next weekend. The models show good agreement the
first half of the period, but begin to diverge with the details of
energy ejection days 5-7. A solution close to that of the ensemble
means should help to mitigate these detail differences.

This cycle of the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a majority blend of the deterministic models
(GFS/ECMWF/CMC) through day 5, quickly increasing the weighting of
the ensemble means thereafter. This maintains overall good WPC
continuity, with one exception being a slower/farther west cold
front progression off the East Coast days 3-4, consistent with the
latest model trends.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Combination closed low held over the West and lead cold Canadian
High Pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below normal)
sets the stage for a potentially heavy upslope snow event over the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains through midweek. Some
deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation is also possible
over the Great Basin. Confidence is increasing on a moderate rain
focus shifting into the Plains Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary will settle/linger this week
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and focus periods of moderate to
heavy rains over the Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southern Plains through the entire period. Amounts don't
look very high, but the Central Gulf Coast states have had much
above normal rainfall recently, so there may be flooding concerns.

Farther north, guidance has noticeably trended upward with respect
to rainfall across parts of the East Coast/Northeast
Thursday-Friday. Some models suggest moderate to locally heavy
rainfall to accompany the cold front/surface low as it traverses
the region. Coastal low genesis may also present some
maritime/coastal threats across New England late week/next
weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 11 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0224 PM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

No changes have been made to the previous forecast. Brief elevated
fire weather conditions may develop across the central High Plains
however, limited confidence in sustained conditions exists
precluding the addition of an elevated area.

..Lyons.. 04/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sun Apr 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will slowly advance across the north-central
CONUS as a second trough aloft begins to deepen along the West
Coast. Surface high pressure and associated cooler, drier air will
spill across portions of the Intermountain West and Plains states
while a surface low and associated warmer conditions are expected to
persist across the southwest U.S.

...Parts of the Southwest U.S...
Despite weak flow aloft, a dry boundary layer is expected to
encourage widespread 10-20% RH across portions of the Lower Colorado
River Basin into the Four Corners region during the afternoon.
Latest guidance consensus suggests that enough downward momentum
transport of the modest flow aloft will support 15 mph sustained
southwesterly winds atop fuels receptive to fire spread, warranting
the introduction of an Elevated area.

...Central High Plains...
As surface high pressure persists across the northern and central
CONUS, 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are expected
tomorrow afternoon across portions of Colorado into Nebraska.
However, guidance varies substantially in terms of minimum RH,
precluding the introduction of an Elevated area at this time, though
Elevated highlights may be introduced in future outlooks if guidance
trends drier.

...Accumulating wet snow expected for the next couple of days
across far Northern Plains as mountain snow gradually develops and
expands across the northern and central Rockies...

...Strong to severe thunderstorms across central Florida will
gradually subside later tonight...

...Unsettled weather continues over the Northeast as fire weather
conditions give away to increasing chance of rain over the
southern High Plains...

A highly obstructed weather pattern across Canada will result in a
low pressure system to remain nearly stationary over the Great
Lakes for the next couple of days.  Scattered areas of rain will
possibly some embedded thunderstorms will linger from across the
Great Lakes into the western portion of New England through
Tuesday ahead of a weakening occluded front. Showers will be
initially found over the Ohio Valley tonight.  Some thunderstorms
are also possible along the Mid-Atlantic coast before a cold front
pushes the storms offshore by this evening, bringing in only
slightly cooler and drier air into the East Coast on Monday.

Meanwhile, the obstructed pattern over Canada will promote colder
than normal conditions to persist across the Northwest and later
into the northern and central Plains.  Reinforcing shots of cold
air rotating around the stationary low pressure system over the
Great Lakes will provide to ingredients for wet snow to develop
near the Canadian border over the northern Plains, which is
forecast to persist into Tuesday.  The snow is not particularly
heavy at a given time but the persistent nature of the snow is
forecast to result in 6 to 12 inches of wet snow to accumulate by
Tuesday evening across the northern half of North Dakota into
northwestern Minnesota.

Farther west, the obstructed pattern will also help a cold upper
low to form and dip across the Pacific Northwest toward the
Southwest for the next couple of days.  This will bring colder
temperatures together with slow development and expansion of
mountain snow across the northern and central Rockies.

Regarding other weather hazards around the country, fire weather
conditions remain at elevated levels in parts of the Southwest and
the central High Plains today. Fire weather conditions improve in
the central High Plain on Monday, but persist in portions of New
Mexico and Arizona. Plus, abnormally chilly conditions have led to
some Frost Advisories being issued for parts of the central Plains
and along the coast of northern California and southwest Oregon.
Lastly, there are a handful of High Wind Warnings in place for
western South Dakota and Wyoming this morning. Wind Advisories
have also been posted for the western Dakotas and eastern Montana
through this evening as wind gusts could reach as high as 55 mph
at times.

Lastly, strong gusty winds over parts of northern Plains should
moderate tonight but they are expected to pick up from time to
time as reinforcing shots of colder air arrive from Canada during
the next couple of days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CDT Mon Apr 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow aloft will dominate much of the western and central U.S.
as an upper trough slowly moves across the northern Plains, while a
second trough aloft gradually deepens across the Interior West. Flow
aloft will be relatively modest across portions of the southwest
U.S. Nonetheless, a dry boundary layer will encourage downward
momentum transport and dry downslope flow across terrain favoring
areas to support modest wildfire-spread potential. Modestly dry and
breezy conditions may also accompany a post-cold-frontal environment
across portions of the Central Plains.

...Portions of the Southwest U.S...
Widespread 10-20% RH is likely by afternoon peak heating across much
of the Lower Colorado River Basin into central New Mexico. The
aforementioned downward mixing is expected to contribute to 15 mph
sustained westerly winds, with Elevated highlights delineating where
the most favorable surface winds/RH overlap are expected to occur.
The lower terrain will be most favorable for wildfire spread as
fuels are more receptive in these areas.

...Central Nebraska...
A surface low departing the Upper Mississippi Valley and persistent
high pressure across the northern Rockies will fortify a dry
northwesterly flow regime across portions of the Central Plains. 20+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are expected across
portions of central Nebraska, when minimum RH is expected to dip
into the 20-25% range. Modestly receptive fine fuels are in place,
warranting the introduction of an Elevated highlight given the
aforementioned surface conditions.

...Central Rockies/High Plains Heavy Snow Threat...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, 12
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models (NBM). Guidance is in better agreement than yesterday,
bolstering forecast confidence. Applied most blend weight to the
models days 3-5 (Thursday-Saturday). Shifted blend weights in
favor of the ensemble means and NBM days 6/7 (Sunday-next Monday)
amid growing forecast spread. This acts to maintain good WPC
continuity in an overall forecast scenario that seems in line with
latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A closed mean trough/low over the West and lead cold Canadian high
pressure (with temp anomalies ~10-20 degrees below normal) this
week should allow a potentially heavy upslope snow event over the
North-Central Rockies/High Plains linger into mid-late week. Some
deformation and terrain enhanced precipitation still remains
possible over parts of the Great Basin. Confidence is also
increasing on a moderate rain focus then gradually shifting into
the Plains Thursday-Friday.

Meanwhile, a wavy frontal boundary settles and lingers this period
into the northern Gulf of Mexico and vicinity to focus several
periods of moderate to heavy rains over Florida/Gulf Coast/Lower
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains through the forecast period.
Timing and details remains uncertain with ejecting focus from
southern stream impulses, but the Central Gulf Coast states and
vicinity have had much above normal rainfall recently, so there
may be flooding concerns.

Farther north, recent guidance has trended stronger and less
progressive with a main upper trough/low over the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast Thursday-Friday. Moderate to locally heavy rainfall can
be expected to accompany an associated front and surface low trek
across the region. There may also be some mountain snows over the
cooled Northeast. Ample coastal low genesis will also present some
maritime and coastal threats later week into the weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE LOWER GREAT
BASIN...

...Synopsis...
An amplifying mid-level trough across the Interior West will
encourage rapid surface low development across portions of the Lower
Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin tomorrow. Strong,
dry southwesterly surface flow will become prevalent by afternoon
peak heating, promoting appreciable wildfire-spread potential where
dry, receptive fuels exist, especially in lower-terrain areas.

...Lower Great Basin into the Lower Colorado River Basin...
The favorable timing of surface low intensification with the diurnal
heating cycle will promote widespread 20+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds amidst 10-15% RH across portions of the
lower Great Basin, where Critical highlights have been introduced.
Farther southeast, a broader Elevated delineation covers portions of
the Lower Colorado River Basin into central New Mexico, where 15-25
mph sustained westerly winds are expected to overlap with 10-15% RH,
atop fuels that support wildfire spread. At least locally Critical
conditions are likely across this broader Elevated area, with
guidance hinting at lower-terrain areas of western New Mexico
potentially seeing longer lasting, more widespread Critical
conditions. Should future guidance show greater consistency in
overlapping widespread Critical conditions across western New
Mexico, Critical highlights may be introduced in future outlooks.

...Scattered showers and a few thunderstorms are possible from the
Great Lakes to the Northeast today; accumulating wet snow expected
the next couple of days in the far Northern Plains...

...Mountain snow gradually develops and expands across the
northern and central Rockies; lingering frontal boundary to
trigger showers and thunderstorms in the South Central U.S...

...Favorable conditions for Elevated to Critical fire weather
conditions in the Southwest to continue into the middle of the
week...

An upper level blocking jet stream pattern across North America
will result in a low pressure system becoming quasi-stationary
over the Upper Midwest for the next couple of days. The area of
low pressure works in tandem with an upper level low tracking into
the northern Mid-Atlantic today to generate scattered showers and
possibly some embedded thunderstorms from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast Coast through Monday night. Along with unsettled
weather, this blocking pattern over Canada allows for colder than
normal conditions to set up shop from the Northwest into the
Nation's Heartland the first half of the week. In fact, enough
sub-freezing air aloft will be available for wet snow to develop
near the Canadian border and over the northern Plains. An extended
period of steady snowfall rates is forecast to result in 6 to 12
inches of snow accumulations by Wednesday morning for the northern
half of North Dakota into northwestern Minnesota.

Farther west, the blocking pattern will also force a cold upper
low to form and dip across the Pacific Northwest toward the Great
Basin for the next couple of days. This brings colder temperatures
together with gradual development and expansion of mountain snow
across the Northwest, the northern Great Basin, and both the
northern and central Rockies. The coldest temperature departures
(15 to 20 degrees below normal) are forecast to occur in the
northern High Plains both Monday and Tuesday. In contrast, warmer
and wetter conditions are anticipated in the South Central U.S. to
kickoff the week. A Slight Risk for severe weather is in place
over central Texas today with a Marginal Risk (for both severe
weather and excessive rainfall) over the Lower Mississippi Valley
on Tuesday.

In the Southwest, low relative humidity levels along with breezy
conditions and dry fuels will support an Elevated Risk for fire
weather in parts of Arizona and New Mexico. There is also an
Elevated Risk for fire weather in central Nebraska today as well.
Conditions only grow more favorable for fire weather as the
aforementioned upper trough in the Northwest deepens, creating a
stronger wind field along with persistent low humidity levels and
dry fuels. This has resulted in a Critical Risk for fire weather
in the lower Great Basin on Tuesday. Depending on the position and
intensity of the upper trough, fire weather could remain an
ongoing issue in the Southwest and lower Great Basin into the
middle of the week.

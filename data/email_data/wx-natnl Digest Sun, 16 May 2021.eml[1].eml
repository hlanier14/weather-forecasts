Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1214 PM CDT Sat May 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHWEST ARIZONA...SOUTHERN
NEVADA...AND SOUTHWEST UTAH...

Expanded the elevated into portions of eastern Utah and combined the
larger elevated with the elevated across southern Arizona/southwest
New Mexico to include areas in between. High resolution model
guidance suggests less than 10 percent relative humidity and winds
of 15 to 20 mph in both areas where the elevated was added.  This is
further supported by current surface observations in the area. Winds
have already increased to 10 to 15 mph across portions of eastern
Arizona.

..Bentley.. 05/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Sat May 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low over northern CA is expected to move slowly
southeastward across central into southern CA today into tonight. A
broad surface low extending from southern NV toward the Four Corners
vicinity is forecast to remain nearly stationary through the day.

...Southwest...
Southwesterly surface winds will increase today across the Southwest
as the upper low gradually approaches the region. Elevated to
critical conditions are expected this afternoon into the early
evening across portions of the lower CO River basin and vicinity, as
sustained winds increase to 15-25 mph (with higher gusts) and RH
values drop into the 5-15% range. A critical area has been added for
portions of southern NV, southwest UT, and northwest AZ, where
confidence is highest in seeing a sufficient duration of critical
conditions. An elevated area has also been added for southeast AZ
into southwest NM, where a separate belt of slightly stronger
low-level flow is forecast to overlap with critically low RH.

There is also some potential for (mostly) dry thunderstorm activity
from far eastern AZ into western NM, though coverage in those areas
could remain quite isolated.

...Northern California...
Scattered thunderstorm development is possible today across northern
CA, in conjunction with the upper low. Gradually increasing moisture
will result in somewhat greater rainfall potential compared to
Friday, so no isolated dry-thunderstorm area has been included.
However, the risk for lightning ignitions will be nonzero where dry
fuels are available.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
Isolated thunderstorms are possible this afternoon across northern
ND into northwest MN. While some spotty rainfall occurred over
northeast ND on Friday, much of this area remains in long-term
drought. Any thunderstorms today would likely be rather dry, and
there may be some potential for ignitions with any strikes occurring
in an area with available fuels. Confidence is too low to include
any highlights at this time, however.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 PM CDT Sat May 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

Expanded the elevated area into eastern Utah where some dry and
breezy conditions also appear likely based on morning high
resolution guidance. Elsewhere, the ongoing forecast appears on
track.

..Bentley.. 05/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Sat May 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low forecast to be over southern CA Sunday morning is
expected to move eastward toward the Four Corners region by the end
of the period Monday morning. A surface low initially over the Great
Basin vicinity is expected to weaken, as another weak surface low
develops over the southern High Plains.

...Southwest into west TX...
Another day of elevated to potentially critical conditions is
expected on Sunday across portions of the Southwest, as the upper
low shifts slowly eastward. Modestly enhanced low-level flow will
persist across much of AZ and spread into portions of NM and west TX
by afternoon. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher) are
expected concurrent with RH values in the 5-15% range. Confidence
regarding the coverage and duration of critical conditions is too
low for an upgrade at this time.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
Dry conditions are expected to persist from northern ND into
northwest MN on Sunday, within a region suffering from long-term
drought. Guidance varies with regard to the strength of low-level
flow on Sunday, with some models suggesting sufficient flow to
support the potential for elevated to locally critical conditions,
while other models keep the stronger flow north of the international
border across the southern Canadian Prairies. If confidence
increases in stronger low-level flow across this region for Sunday,

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles this morning continue to advertise the
likelihood of a heavy rain event that should be well under way
across the central to southern Plains during the middle of next
week.  The latest model solutions tend to focus an axis of
heaviest rain across eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma on
Wednesday before shifting southward closer to the Texas Gulf coast
region on Thursday.  There is general agreement that the
associated upper trough and the surface front will weaken as they
lift northward through the Plains for the remainder of next week.
The weaker dynamics should tend to lower the threat of widespread
heavy rain toward next weekend but deep-layered southerly flow
will likely keep the channel of Gulf moisture open to support at
least scattered convection with areas of heavy rain across the
central and southern Plains.  In addition, the convection appears
to become more diurnally-driven toward next weekend and may tend
to edge westward closer toward the central to southern High Plains
as a deep upper trough approaches the western U.S.

Meanwhile, there has been a strong model signal for a deep
trough/closed low to dig into the western U.S. during the latter
half of next week but the details of its eventual evolution
remains subject to change.  The latest model consensus has trended
toward a slightly less amplified system overall, which allows a
faster progression of a frontal wave to move eastward into the
northern Plains late next week, together with moderate
precipitation across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of reasonably well clustered mid-larger scale
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Smaller scale
system differences and convective rainfall focus details remain
much less certain. Latest 00 UTC models and ensembles are overall
in line with this favored composite plan.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies to lift over the Plains.
Expect a multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall
along with periods of increased instability and strong to severe
convection. Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will
likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some specifics may take
until well into the short range to be resolved, but the guidance
signal for a wet pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has
been consistent. Meanwhile over-top, the Midwest eastward may see
one or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity underneath a building
Southeast upper ridge may support some heavy downpours for
southern Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. The 12/18 UTC GFS
runs seemed too aggressive developing an organized low, but the 00
UTC run backed off.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies, including some mountain snows. Ahead of the Pacific
front that moves into the West, maximum temperatures 10-20F above
normal will progress from the Northwest U.S. though the northern
Rockies/Plains early next week. A post-frontal cooling trend may
bring 10-20F below normal temperatures into the Intermountain
West.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 15 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19900506 - 19730517 - 19520517 - 19580527 - 19650528

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles this morning continue to advertise the
likelihood of a heavy rain event that should be well under way
across the central to southern Plains during the middle of next
week.  The latest model solutions tend to focus an axis of
heaviest rain across eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma on
Wednesday before shifting southward closer to the Texas Gulf coast
region on Thursday.  There is general agreement that the
associated upper trough and the surface front will weaken as they
lift northward through the Plains for the remainder of next week.
The weaker dynamics should tend to lower the threat of widespread
heavy rain toward next weekend but deep-layered southerly flow
will likely keep the channel of Gulf moisture open to support at
least scattered convection with areas of heavy rain across the
central and southern Plains.  In addition, the convection appears
to become more diurnally-driven toward next weekend and may tend
to edge westward closer toward the central to southern High Plains
as a deep upper trough approaches the western U.S.

Meanwhile, there has been a strong model signal for a deep
trough/closed low to dig into the western U.S. during the latter
half of next week but the details of its eventual evolution
remains subject to change.  The latest model consensus has trended
toward a slightly less amplified system overall, which allows a
faster progression of a frontal wave to move eastward into the
northern Plains late next week, together with moderate
precipitation across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains.
 A general blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS was
used to handle this system.  The 00Z CMC appears to be a bit too
progressive with this system.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies to lift over the Plains.
Expect a multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall
along with periods of increased instability and strong to severe
convection. Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will
likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some specifics may take
until well into the short range to be resolved, but the guidance
signal for a wet pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has
been consistent. Meanwhile over-top, the Midwest eastward may see
one or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity underneath a building
Southeast upper ridge may support some heavy downpours for
southern Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies, including some mountain snows. Ahead of the Pacific
front that moves into the West, maximum temperatures 10-20F above
normal will progress from the Northwest U.S. though the northern
Rockies/Plains early next week. A post-frontal cooling trend may
bring 10-20F below normal temperatures into the Intermountain
West.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley next week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles this morning continue to advertise the
likelihood of a heavy rain event that should be well under way
across the central to southern Plains during the middle of next
week.  The latest model solutions tend to focus an axis of
heaviest rain across eastern Texas and eastern Oklahoma on
Wednesday before shifting southward closer to the Texas Gulf coast
region on Thursday.  There is general agreement that the
associated upper trough and the surface front will weaken as they
lift northward through the Plains for the remainder of next week.
The weaker dynamics should tend to lower the threat of widespread
heavy rain toward next weekend but deep-layered southerly flow
will likely keep the channel of Gulf moisture open to support at
least scattered convection with areas of heavy rain across the
central and southern Plains.  In addition, the convection appears
to become more diurnally-driven toward next weekend and may tend
to edge westward closer toward the central to southern High Plains
as a deep upper trough approaches the western U.S.

Meanwhile, there has been a strong model signal for a deep
trough/closed low to dig into the western U.S. during the latter
half of next week but the details of its eventual evolution
remains subject to change.  The latest model consensus has trended
toward a slightly less amplified system overall, which allows a
faster progression of a frontal wave to move eastward into the
northern Plains late next week, together with moderate
precipitation across the northern Rockies to northern High Plains.
 A general blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS was
used to handle this system.  The 00Z CMC appears to be a bit too
progressive with this system.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving south-central U.S. frontal system next
week. This will occur in downstream response to the slow ejection
and passage of a southern stream upper-level trough/low energies
forecast to exit the southern Rockies to lift over the Plains.
Expect a multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall
along with periods of increased instability and strong to severe
convection. Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will
likely vary on a day-to-day basis and some specifics may take
until well into the short range to be resolved, but the guidance
signal for a wet pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has
been consistent. Meanwhile over-top, the Midwest eastward may see
one or more convective systems aided by a wavy front and uncertain
northern shortwave energy aloft to focus moisture and instability.
Well south, late period moisture/vorticity underneath a building
Southeast upper ridge may support some heavy downpours for
southern Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest through the north-central Intermountain
West/Rockies, including some mountain snows. Ahead of the Pacific
front that moves into the West, maximum temperatures 10-20F above
normal will progress from the Northwest U.S. though the northern
Rockies/Plains early next week. A post-frontal cooling trend may
bring 10-20F below normal temperatures into the Intermountain
West.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across the central
and southern Plains through at least Monday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
central Great Basin/Southwest through Sunday morning...

A wet and active weather pattern will persist across central and
south-central sections of the country through early next week. A
stationary boundary extending from the central Rockies through the
central Plains and into the Ohio/Tennessee valleys will be the
focus for multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms. This
evening and overnight, a few thunderstorms may turn severe across
the central and southern High Plains. Damaging wind gusts and
large hail are the main concern, with isolated tornadoes possible
throughout the central High Plains and southwest Texas. Downpours
could lead to isolated flash flooding across central and eastern
Kansas, as well as south-central Texas tonight. Sunday and Monday
will feature similar weather hazards across the same region. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather
on both Sunday and Monday that includes portions of the central
High Plains and southern Plains. With the ongoing thunderstorms,
flash flooding will remain a possibility across these regions
while also extending into the Middle Mississippi Valley as well.
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Sunday that
stretches from central Missouri to north-central Texas.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and thunderstorms will also be found
across southern Florida, the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and
Northeast between tonight and Monday. High temperatures are
forecast to run well above normal across the Northern Plains,
Upper Midwest, and northern Great Basin. Highs into the upper-70s
and 80s will make it feel more like June and potentially worsen
extreme drought conditions throughout in the Northern Plains.
Meanwhile, gusty winds and low relative humidity will create
critical fire weather this evening across southern Nevada,
southwest Utah, and northwest Arizona. Red Flag Warnings have also
been issued for this area.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CDT Sun May 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low embedded in a mid-level trough over
portions of California/Nevada will slowly shift east throughout the
day, sliding into portions of the lower Great Basin by the end of
the period. As this occurs, a broad region of marginally enhanced
southwesterly mid-level flow will overspread much of the Southwest
into the southern High Plains throughout the day. At the surface,
warm/dry conditions are expected to persist.

...Southwest into West Texas...
Diurnal heating/mixing processes will allow some of the marginally
enhanced mid-level flow to mix toward the surface, resulting in
sustained southwesterly winds of 10-15 mph. Meanwhile, RH values
should fall into the teens and single digits. Fuels across the
region remain at least marginally receptive to large-fire spread.
Thus elevated fire-weather conditions can be expected, with perhaps
some localized critical fire-weather conditions possible where winds
manage to be a bit stronger.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
A surface low will track through south central portions of Canada
throughout the day, with southwesterly post-frontal surface flow
extending into northern portions of North Dakota into far northwest
Minnesota. RH values should fall into the teens to lower 20s, with
sustained winds of 10-15 mph. Locally elevated conditions can be
expected across this region, but such conditions appear too
localized to warrant any highlights at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 AM CDT Sun May 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low positioned over portions of the lower Great
Basin will shift east slowly, while transitioning to more of an open
wave within the broader mid-level trough. The trough is forecast to
move into the four-corners region by the end of the forecast period,
which should shift much of the marginally enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow, associated with the southern periphery of the
trough, into portions of northern Mexico and the southern High
Plains. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis will commence along the
southern High Plains, with a surface dry line extending into
portions of West/Southwest Texas.

...Southwest into West Texas...
Dry/breezy conditions will persist across a more confined region
compared to previous days, as the upper-level pattern begins to
shift eastward. Afternoon heating/mixing processes will result in
sustained southwesterly surface winds of 10-15 mph to develop while
RH values fall into the low teens and single digits amid
dry/receptive fuels. This will result in elevated fire-weather
conditions, with locally critical conditions possible where winds
end up a bit stronger, particularly if the surface pressure gradient
is enhanced by the developing surface cyclone. There remains some
uncertainty in the position and evolution of the dry line, and thus,
additional refinements to the eastern boundary of the elevated area
can be expected in later outlooks.

...Heavy rain threat for the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley this week...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived days 3-5
(Wed-Fri) from a composite blend of reasonably well clustered
mid-larger scale guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models. Smaller scale system differences and convective rainfall
focus details remain less certain and growing forecast spread
through medium scales next weekend prompted usage of mainly just
the ensemble means and NBM. By then, the 18/00 UTC GFS runs move
to the more progressive side of solutions and the 12/00 UTC ECMWF
the less progressive side of the solution envelope. The
aforementioned WPC forecast plan focusing on the ensemble means
maintains good WPC product continuity near the envelope composite.
This seems prudent given the recent model run-run fluctuations at
these longer time scales.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will return into an
emerging and slow moving central U.S. systems this week. This will
occur in downstream response to the slow ejection and passage of a
southern stream upper-level trough/low energies forecast to exit
the southern Rockies to lift up over the Plains. Expect a
multi-day period with a threat of significant rainfall along with
periods of increased instability and strong to severe convection.
Locations and magnitude of heaviest rainfall will likely vary on a
day-to-day basis and some specifics may take until well into the
short range to be resolved, but the guidance signal for a wet
pattern mainly over the south-central U.S. has been consistent.
Meanwhile, deep moisture and vorticity underneath a building upper
ridge over the East may support some heavy downpours for southern
Florida and into the Gulf of Mexico. Ridge amplification will
coincide with substantial warming this week from the Midwest to
the especially the East where some record high minimum and maximum
values are possible as temperature anomalies build upwards to
10-20F above normal.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest and Sierra through the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies, including some mountain enhanced
snows. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West, early
week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the Northwest
U.S. though the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool with
pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage that may
result in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

westward to the Central/Southern High Plains, then into the Great
Basin through Tuesday morning.  A dryline will develop over parts
of the Southern High Plains, making a daily oscillation eastward.
Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will stream northward
over the Plains and the Mississippi Valley that will help produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern
Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley through Tuesday.
Additionally, the showers and thunderstorms will also develop over
parts of the Northern/Central Rockies into the Great Basin.  The
SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central/Southern High Plains through Monday morning.  The main
threats from the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning,
severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Furthermore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley into parts of
the Southern Plains/Western Gulf Coast through Monday morning.
The heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms will produce
localized areas of flash flooding.  The areas that are most
vulnerable to the heavy rain are urban areas, roads, and small
streams.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy over the Great Lakes will produce
rain over the Great Lakes into parts of the Northeast expand into
parts of the Mid-Atlantic by Sunday evening.  The rain will taper
off over the Great Lakes and the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic overnight
Sunday. On Sunday, the light rain will expand into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.  The rain will redevelop over parts of the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic on Monday afternoon/evening, tapering off
overnight.  An upper-level low over portions of California on
Sunday will move into parts of the Central/Southern Rockies by
Tuesday.  The energy will produce scattered rain over parts of
California on Sunday.  Additionally, as the upper-level low moves
eastward, dry conditions and gusty winds have led to an Elevated
Risk of fire weather over parts of the Southwest, Southern
Rockies, and parts of the Southern High Plains through Monday
morning.

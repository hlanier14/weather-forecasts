...Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding for
parts of the central Texas Gulf Coast today...

...Pacific Northwest system produces moderate to heavy snowfall
for Cascades and Northern Rockies today before spreading light
snow and high winds across Northern Plains tonight; Critical Fire
Weather Risk for parts of northwestern Nebraska this afternoon...

...A large and significant winter storm is expected to impact much
of the central U.S. beginning the middle of this week...

A closed upper-level low will make its way across Texas today.
This upper-feature will tap into Gulf moisture and send it
streaming northward over a surface front draped along the Texas
Gulf Coast. A focused area of heavy rainfall and scattered to
isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop today roughly
between Houston and Corpus Christi. Multiple inches of rain are
forecast to fall, particularly over inland areas. A Slight Risk of
Heavy Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding is in effect for this
area as a result. The intensity of this threat is likely to wane
by Tuesday, when the upper-low is forecast to weaken and
eventually be absorbed into the broader flow to its north. Light
rain and scattered thunderstorms are likely to spread into the
central Gulf Coast during this period.

A Pacific Northwest system, powered by shortwave energy slicing
through the region, will continue to bring moderate to heavy snow
to parts of the Cascades and Northern Rockies today before setting
its sights on the Northern Plains tonight. Warm air will spread
across the Plains and Mississippi Valley out ahead of this system
today and on Tuesday. This system will deepen quite a bit as it
moves across southern Canada today, leading to light snow and high
winds across portions of the Northern Plains where High Wind
Warnings are in effect. High winds and dry conditions will also
lead to the threat of fires across portions of northwestern
Nebraska where Critical Fire Weather is a concern.

A closed upper-level low out in the North Pacific will phase with
shortwave energy coming from northwest Canada. This phasing will
amplify the mean trough reinforcing the Pacific Northwest system
and sending its associated cold front sweeping down across the
Plains on Tuesday as the surface low over southern Canada
continues to strengthen. Frigid arctic air will begin to enter
into the Northern Plains on Wednesday as a result. The amplified
upper-level trough will tap into Gulf moisture on Wednesday as the
arctic airmass sweeps down the spine of the Great Plains. This
will be the setup for a powerful midweek winter storm impacting a
wide swath of the country's mid-section extending from portions of
the Central/Southern Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, Midwest,
Great Lakes and eventually the Northeast.

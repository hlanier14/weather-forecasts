1053 AM CST Mon Feb 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO...

Trimmed the northern/eastern extent of the elevated area across
Colorado for cold surface temperatures which are expected to remain
with downslope warming only expected in close proximity to the
mountains. This was seen in the observations yesterday and should
only be more pronounced today as the cold air is more entrenched.

..Bentley.. 02/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Mon Feb 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
While broad cyclonic flow aloft and associated surface high pressure
will prevail across much of the CONUS, an embedded mid-level impulse
is expected to traverse the south-central U.S during the day.
Surface lee troughing along the southern High Plains, coincident
with diurnal heating, is expected to promote dry and breezy
downslope flow along the lee of the southern Rockies, with
wildfire-spread conditions expected.

...Southern High Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, the dry downslope flow will encourage 20%
surface RH across the Colorado Front Range, with RH as low as 10%
likely across eastern New Mexico into the Trans Pecos region in
southwest Texas. As 20+ mph sustained westerly downslope flow is
expected to overspread the southern High Plains, the wind/RH overlap
will promote favorable wildfire-spread conditions, warranting an
Elevated delineation. A Critical area was added where 10% RH is
expected to overlap with 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds
for several hours this afternoon, and where fuels are modestly
receptive to fire spread. Elsewhere within the Elevated delineation,
locally Critical wind/RH are possible.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week as unsettled weather reaches the West Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather/Threats Highlights...

Unsettled and active pattern evolving over the CONUS during the
period with multiple systems affecting both the west coast to the
central/east coast. The large scale pattern focuses on the
evolution and eventual shearing of the polar vortex over the Great
Lakes to New England with an eventual Pacific shortwave that digs
a trough over the western U.S. by late in the period. This setup
favors a continuation of the much below normal temperatures and
Arctic air over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest that slowly
sags southward across more of the CONUS by day 7. Ahead of that,
interactions along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf to
Southeast will lead to several possible low pressure systems
riding up the coast (or offshore) and this brings some potential
sensible weather impacts including wintry precipitation. For the
West Coast, after a brief reprieve in active weather, the approach
of a stronger storm system will bring enhanced moisture with
potential for heavy snow for the higher elevations and rainfall to
the lower valleys.

The guidance over the last several days has cycled and struggled
with the southward push of the polar vortex. Recent trends show
that there will be less of a southward intrusion as the PV gets
sheared out to the east portions of the Great Lakes to northern
New England as the Pacific energy quickly moves toward the West
Coast and Rockies. The models are in reasonable agreement with
this idea, though the deterministic 00Z CMC was less favored as it
was considerably slower while the other models showed fair amount
of agreement. For the west coast shortwave, the typical fast bias
GFS was noted while the ECMWF was slower.

Overall, while large scale/upper level pattern was fairly
predictable, the individual shortwaves and low pressure tracks,
especially for the eastern U.S. had lower than average forecast
confidence, especially day 5 onward. As such, the WPC blend was
derived initially from a near equal blend of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z
GFS, 00Z CMC, and 00Z UKMET followed by mostly a ECMWF/ECENS and
GFS/GEFS blend for day 5 to day 7.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A swath of winter precipitation remains in the forecast for
portions of the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic early in the
period while ice accumulations could be significant for portions
of KY at the start of day 3. As an arctic front on the heels of a
very strong Canadian high pressure (high near 1046 mb forecast),
upslope/terrain snow over the Rockies could be heavy while another
system could organize and lift up through the Mid-Atlantic this
weekend bringing another round of winter precipitation to portions
of the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic to Northeast. There is
considerably uncertainty and large variability for the weekend
forecast for the East Coast however. Temperature wise, the Arctic
frigid air will continue over the Northern Plains, Northern
Rockies, and Upper Midwest for much of the period where anomalies
of 30-45F are forecast across the middle of the country. This is
expected to slowly overspread, but moderate somewhat, across much
of the country by the end of the forecast period.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week as unsettled weather reaches the West Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather/Threats Highlights...

Unsettled and active pattern evolving over the CONUS during the
period with multiple systems affecting both the west coast to the
central/east coast. The large scale pattern focuses on the
evolution and eventual shearing of the polar vortex over the Great
Lakes to New England with an eventual Pacific shortwave that digs
a trough over the western U.S. by late in the period. This setup
favors a continuation of the much below normal temperatures and
Arctic air over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest that slowly
sags southward across more of the CONUS by day 7. Ahead of that,
interactions along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf to
Southeast will lead to several possible low pressure systems
riding up the coast (or offshore) and this brings some potential
sensible weather impacts including wintry precipitation. For the
West Coast, after a brief reprieve in active weather, the approach
of a stronger storm system will bring enhanced moisture with
potential for heavy snow for the higher elevations and rainfall to
the lower valleys.

The guidance over the last several days has cycled and struggled
with the southward push of the polar vortex. Recent trends show
that there will be less of a southward intrusion as the PV gets
sheared out to the east portions of the Great Lakes to northern
New England as the Pacific energy quickly moves toward the West
Coast and Rockies. The models are in reasonable agreement with
this idea, though the deterministic 00Z CMC was less favored as it
was considerably slower while the other models showed fair amount
of agreement. For the west coast shortwave, the typical fast bias
GFS was noted while the ECMWF was slower.

Overall, while large scale/upper level pattern was fairly
predictable, the individual shortwaves and low pressure tracks,
especially for the eastern U.S. had lower than average forecast
confidence, especially day 5 onward. As such, the WPC blend was
derived initially from a near equal blend of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z
GFS, 00Z CMC, and 00Z UKMET followed by mostly a ECMWF/ECENS and
GFS/GEFS blend for day 5 to day 7.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A swath of winter precipitation remains in the forecast for
portions of the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic early in the
period while ice accumulations could be significant for portions
of KY at the start of day 3. As an arctic front on the heels of a
very strong Canadian high pressure (high near 1046 mb forecast),
upslope/terrain snow over the Rockies could be heavy while another
system could organize and lift up through the Mid-Atlantic this
weekend bringing another round of winter precipitation to portions
of the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic to Northeast. There is
considerably uncertainty and large variability for the weekend
forecast for the East Coast however. Temperature wise, the Arctic
frigid air will continue over the Northern Plains, Northern
Rockies, and Upper Midwest for much of the period where anomalies
of 30-45F are forecast across the middle of the country. This is
expected to slowly overspread, but moderate somewhat, across much
of the country by the end of the forecast period.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: The main weather story during Week-2 is likely to be an anomalous
cold spell that persists throughout most of the CONUS east of the Rockies. The
highest risk for the coldest temperatures exists throughout the Plains and
Great Lakes, with overnight temperatures forecast to be extremely cold for the
first few days of the week. There is also a slight risk for heavy
precipitation
throughout the Gulf States along the path of a fast moving surface low.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the Plains,
Mississippi
Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes, Tue-Fri, Feb 16-19.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the central and
eastern U.S., Tue-Fri, Feb 16-19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for nearly all of the central
and
eastern U.S., Tue-Mon, Feb 16-22.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the central Gulf Coast, Tue-Wed, Feb
16-17.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 11 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!twvzFhM_paoUxj1XVy3dFFg8Ub5S9yA66NsrJffpw2od3uthiY1KzkvyxycMZ5CmCBIQ5k9d$

FOR TUESDAY FEBRUARY 16 - MONDAY FEBRUARY 22: Anomalous cold is expected to
persist from Week-1 into Week-2 as 500-hPa troughing is favored to remain in
place during at least the first few days of the forecast period. The 00 UTC
GFS
and ECMWF ensemble means suggest that a strong negative height anomaly at
500-hPa will be centered over the Northern Plains for most of Week-2. This is
a
bit further east than expected during Week-1, with the trough axis shifting
from the Plains into the Mississippi Valley during the outlook period.



Our GFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools are in good agreement regarding
the
timing and extent of the coldest temperatures. Both tools suggest a high
chance
of much below normal minimum temperatures throughout most of the Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes during the first four days of
the period. We have issued corresponding hazards for moderate and high risks
of
much below minimum temperatures for this period. The GEFS, in particular,
forecasts a 40% chance that overnight temperatures in the Central Plains will
be in the bottom 2nd percentile of climatology, which means the potential for
record breaking overnight lows reaching as far south as northern Texas.



The aforementioned trough is forecast to weaken and lift northeastward by the
middle of Week-2. The axis of coldest temperatures should follow the trough
and
a corresponding slight risk (20% chance) of much below minimum temperatures
has
been posted for the duration of Week-2 for nearly all of the CONUS east of the
Rockies.



The ECMWF predicts a surface low to move through the Southeast during the
first
two days of the period. Reforecast guidance supports at least a 20% chance
that
heavy precipitation will occur along the track of this storm and a
corresponding hazard is issued for the region. There is also a risk of heavy
snowfall throughout high elevations in the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada
mountains due to generally wet and cold conditions favored for the Pacific
Northwest during Week-2. We have not posted a related hazard because forecast
snowfall amounts are not high enough to meet our criteria, but concerned
parties should monitor forecasts from their local NWS offices.

...Arctic air to remain entrenched across the north central U.S.
for the upcoming week...

...A significant ice storm possible Wednesday into Thursday from
the Mid Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley...

...Light to moderate snows possible from New England into the Mid
Atlantic and Upper Ohio Valley...

No let up expected to the very cold weather pattern affecting
large portions of the central to north central U.S.  A broad upper
vortex centered across much of southern Canada will lock in arctic
air across much of the central U.S. from the Northern to Central
Plains and into the Upper Mississippi Valley. High temperatures
will remain below zero Tuesday and Wednesday from central to
eastern Montana, across much of North Dakota and into northern
Minnesota.  Low temperatures Tuesday and Wednesday mornings across
these same areas will likely be in the -15 to -30F range.  The
combination of these temperatures and wind will result in life
threatening wind chill values as low as -55F, with these areas
currently under wind chill warnings and advisories.  While
temperatures are not expected to be as cold farther to the south,
much below average temperatures are expected across much of the
central U.S. with temperatures 20 to 30 degrees below average over
the next several days.  To the southeast of the much below average
temperatures, much above average temperatures are expected from
South Texas, eastward into the Lower Mississippi Valley, along the
northern Gulf coast and across Florida.  High temperatures across
these areas expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above average Tuesday
and Wednesday.

The frontal boundary on the leading edge of the central U.S.
arctic air will be the focus for two rounds of wintry weather over
the next few days.  The first storm will produce light to moderate
snow fall amounts from portions of the Upper Ohio Valley into the
northern Mid-Atlantic and much of New England Monday night through
Tuesday.  This will be followed by a second storm system Wednesday
spreading snows from portions of the Mid Mississippi Valley into
the Ohio Valley and Mid Atlantic.  To the south of the area of
accumulating snows, a significant ice storm is possible Wednesday
into Thursday from northeast Arkansas/southeast Missouri, across
far southern Illinois into northern Kentucky, with ice
accumulations in excess of .25" possible across these areas.

Expanded the northern portion of the elevated area slightly to
account for the latest high resolution guidance and the location of
the boundary. Critical conditions may be possible during the
afternoon hours in eastern New Mexico, but duration appears somewhat
limited at this time. A critical delineation may be needed in later
outlooks.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Mon Feb 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move across the southwest U.S during the Day
2/Tuesday period. While surface high pressure and associated cool
conditions are expected to prevail across much of the central U.S
Tuesday, the approach of the aforementioned mid-level trough from
the west will encourage surface lee troughing across the southern
High Plains. Dry and breezy conditions Tuesday afternoon across the
southern High Plains will support some potential for wildfire
spread.

...Southern High Plains...
Downslope flow across eastern New Mexico into the Trans Pecos region
of southwest Texas is expected to promote 15-20 mph sustained
westerly surface winds overlapping with 10-20% RH during the
afternoon hours. An Elevated area was delineated to account for
favorable wildfire-spread conditions over fuels modestly receptive
to fire spread. However, the latest guidance depicts at least
locally Critical conditions across eastern New Mexico during the mid
to late afternoon hours. If future guidance suggests that 20 mph
wind speeds can be maintained for longer than currently anticipated,
a Critical area may be added in future outlooks.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon February 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 14 - 18 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern across North America and adjacent ocean areas
during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a broad longwave 500-hPa
trough across the CONUS. Upstream of this trough, ridging is forecast over the
Gulf of Alaska and offshore of  the West Coast of the CONUS. The manual height
blend depicts negative height anomalies for most of the CONUS. Positive height
anomalies are forecast across the Atlantic Coast and parts of the Southeast,
as
well as Alaska and parts of the immediate California Coast.

Probabilities below normal temperatures are elevated for most of the CONUS,
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Todays forecast depicts
80% probabilities of below normal temperatures over the Central Great Plains
and Middle Mississippi Valley. Conversely,  above normal temperature
probabilities are increased for much of the Florida Peninsula. Despite the
positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast over Alaska, strong easterly flow
favors increased near to below normal temperature probabilities across most of
the Mainland and the Panhandle. A slight tilt toward increased above normal
temperature probabilities is highlighted across the Aleutians and Alaska
Peninsula as upstream troughing over the Central Pacific is forecast to
promote
increased southerly mid-level flow over these areas.

Increased above normal precipitation probabilities are depicted across the
most
CONUS, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Mean frontal
boundaries
are favored to set up across the eastern CONUS where above normal
precipitation
probabilities are increased. A continued active storm track is favored across
much of the western CONUS coinciding with enhanced above normal precipitation
probabilities. Across Alaska, most forecast tools are favoring below normal
precipitation probabilities due to prolonged influence of the ridge.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good tool agreement, and high confidence regarding below normal temperatures
across nearly the entire CONUS, offset by increasing uncertainty in regards to
the precipitation forecast over the CONUS


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 16 - 22 2021

A continuation of a similar synoptic pattern is forecast during week-2 across
North America. Troughing is favored over the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS,
with ridging persisting over the Gulf of Alaska, and extending closer to the
West Coast of the CONUS compared to the 6-10 day period. Todays manual 500-hPa
height blend for week-2 depicts below normal heights across much of the CONUS
east of the Rockies. However, near to above normal heights are forecast for
the
West Coast, southern Texas, parts of the Southeast, and most of Alaska.

Predicted large scale troughing leads to enhanced probabilities of below
normal
temperatures for most of the CONUS, with the highest chances across parts of
the central CONUS. Above normal temperature probabilities are increased over
the Florida Peninsula consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. A
trend toward colder temperatures is forecast for central and northern Alaska
and the Panhandle consistent with the consolidation tool. Increased
probabilities for above normal temperatures are favored across the Alaska
Peninsula and the Aleutians underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa
heights..

Probabilities of above normal precipitation remain slightly increased on the
east side of the mean longwave trough axis over the CONUS, specifically from
the Tennessee Valley to  parts of the Mid-Atlantic, consistent with enhanced
frontal activity across the region. Below normal precipitation probabilities
are increased over much of the southwestern CONUS due to increased ridging.
Elevated below normal precipitation chances also extend through parts of the
Northern and Southern Plains, as a result of the influence of surface high
pressure. Increased above normal precipitation probabilities are favored
across
the Northwestern CONUS and the Central Plains, due to the forecast progression
of shortwave disturbances across these areas. Below normal precipitation is
likely for parts of northern Alaska underneath forecast above normal heights,
with a slight tilt toward increased above normal precipitation probabilities
across the Aleutians, the central and southern Mainland, and the Panhandle due
to increasing southerly mid-level flow as the ridge axis retrogrades to the
east.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement on a continued amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertainty
in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS, as well as the
surface pattern evolution across Alaska.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week as unsettled weather reaches the West Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather/Threats Highlights...

Unsettled and active pattern evolving over the CONUS during the
period with multiple systems affecting both the west coast to the
central/east coast. The large scale pattern focuses on the
evolution and eventual shearing of the polar vortex over the Great
Lakes to New England with an eventual Pacific shortwave that digs
a trough over the western U.S. by late in the period. This setup
favors a continuation of the much below normal temperatures and
Arctic air over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest that slowly
sags southward across more of the CONUS by day 7. Ahead of that,
interactions along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf to
Southeast will lead to several possible low pressure systems
riding up the coast (or offshore) and this brings some potential
sensible weather impacts including wintry precipitation. For the
West Coast, after a brief reprieve in active weather, the approach
of a stronger storm system will bring enhanced moisture with
potential for heavy snow for the higher elevations and rainfall to
the lower valleys.

The guidance over the last several days has cycled and struggled
with the southward push of the polar vortex. Recent trends show
that there will be less of a southward intrusion as the PV gets
sheared out to the east portions of the Great Lakes to northern
New England as the Pacific energy quickly moves toward the West
Coast and Rockies. The models are in reasonable agreement with
this idea, though the deterministic 00Z CMC was less favored as it
was considerably slower while the other models showed fair amount
of agreement. For the west coast shortwave, the typical fast bias
GFS was noted while the ECMWF was slower.

Overall, while large scale/upper level pattern was fairly
predictable, the individual shortwaves and low pressure tracks,
especially for the eastern U.S. had lower than average forecast
confidence, especially day 5 onward. As such, the WPC blend was
derived initially from a near equal blend of the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z
GFS, 00Z CMC, and 00Z UKMET followed by mostly a ECMWF/ECENS and
GFS/GEFS blend for day 5 to day 7.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...
A swath of winter precipitation remains in the forecast for
portions of the Ohio Valley to the Mid-Atlantic early in the
period while ice accumulations could be significant for portions
of KY at the start of day 3. As an arctic front on the heels of a
very strong Canadian high pressure (high near 1046 mb forecast),
upslope/terrain snow over the Rockies could be heavy while another
system could organize and lift up through the Mid-Atlantic this
weekend bringing another round of winter precipitation to portions
of the Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic to Northeast. There is
considerably uncertainty and large variability for the weekend
forecast for the East Coast however. Temperature wise, the Arctic
frigid air will continue over the Northern Plains, Northern
Rockies, and Upper Midwest for much of the period where anomalies
of 30-45F are forecast across the middle of the country. This is
expected to slowly overspread, but moderate somewhat, across much
of the country by the end of the forecast period.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A relatively focused area of elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions will develop this afternoon from northeastern New Mexico
southward into far west Texas west of a slow-moving frontal zone
near the NM/TX border.  This frontal zone will separate an Arctic
airmass to its east from dry, breezy conditions to its west.  The
dry airmass will also reside beneath moderately strong mid-level
flow, which should help with enhancement of surface winds through
vertical mixing processes.

...Central/eastern New Mexico and far west Texas...
The aforementioned synoptic conditions will foster development of a
couple of corridors of 20+ mph surface winds - one from Torrance to
Quay Counties and another from Chaves to Lea counties.  These
surface winds will occur amidst a very dry airmass with 9-15% RH
values possible areawide during peak heating hours.  A critical
delineation has been drawn in these areas to address this scenario.

Surrounding the critical area, models indicate that winds will be
slightly weaker (in the 10-20 mph range).  The airmass should be
just as dry as in the critical area, though the eastern extent of
elevated conditions will depend on the westward progression of
Arctic area across the Texas South Plains/Panhandle.  Locally
elevated fire-weather conditions will also exist west of the central
New Mexico mountains where fuels are dry.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1252 AM CST Tue Feb 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will become far more localized on D2/Wed
compared to D1/Tuesday across the southern High Plains.  A small
area of breezy and dry conditions will develop immediately ahead of
a frontal zone (with very cold air to its east) across eastern New
Mexico.  The position of this frontal zone will ultimately determine
the eastward extent of fire-weather throughout the forecast period.

...New Mexico and a small part of west Texas...
Localized areas of 15-20 mph surface winds will develop along an
axis from the Guadalupe Mountains northward to roughly Guadalupe
County, New Mexico near Las Vegas.  These winds will occur within a
dry low-level airmass just west of the front characterized by 10-17%
minimum RH values.  Dry fuels are also in place - in part due to a
lack of recent rainfall and relatively dry antecedent conditions.
An elevated delineation is in place to address this scenario.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...

...Significant late week upslope/mountain snow possible in the
northern and central Rockies...

...A couple of winter weather events possible for the Mid-Atlantic
to Northeast late week and weekend...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather Highlights...

A large portion of the northern and central U.S. will remain under
the grip of an arctic air mass through much of the medium-range
period.  Global models continue to indicate that a polar vortex
centered in the Canadian prairies will remain the dominant
synoptic system.  The ECMWF and to some degree the CMC, agree that
the vortex will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the GFS tends to
grab the upper-level energy coming across the Pacific Northwest
and pull it around the south side of the polar vortex, resulting
in frontal wave development in the eastern U.S. during the
weekend.  The ECMWF/CMC solution is preferred given better
ensemble mean support as well as better agreement with WPC
continuity.  This setup favors a continuation of frigid conditions
over the northern Plains and upper Midwest as a couple of wintry
weather events are possible late this week and later in the
weekend from the Mid-Atlantic to Northeast.  The specifics are far
from certain at this point.

Over the northern and central Rockies into the Intermountain
region, models continue to signal for increasing amounts of
upslope/mountain snow under a tight pressure gradient behind the
arctic front late this week into the weekend.  Meanwhile, three
Pacific systems are forecast to move into the West Coast during
the medium range focusing across the Pacific Northwest and down
into northern California with reasonable model spread.

Along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf, models are in good
agreement for a period of enhanced rainfall to overspread the Gulf
Coast States likely inland focuses for the interior Southeast.

Temperature wise, the frigid air will continue over the Northern

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...

...Significant late week upslope/mountain snow possible in the
northern and central Rockies...

...A couple of winter weather events possible for the Mid-Atlantic
to Northeast late week and weekend...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather Highlights...

A large portion of the northern and central U.S. will remain under
the grip of an arctic air mass through much of the medium-range
period.  Global models continue to indicate that a polar vortex
centered in the Canadian prairies will remain the dominant
synoptic system.  The ECMWF and to some degree the CMC, agree that
the vortex will begin to weaken and slide eastward across the
Great Lakes by this weekend.  On the other hand, the GFS tends to
grab the upper-level energy coming across the Pacific Northwest
and pull it around the south side of the polar vortex, resulting
in frontal wave development in the eastern U.S. during the
weekend.  The ECMWF/CMC solution is preferred given better
ensemble mean support as well as better agreement with WPC
continuity.  This setup favors a continuation of frigid conditions
over the northern Plains and upper Midwest as a couple of wintry
weather events are possible late this week and later in the
weekend from the Mid-Atlantic to Northeast.  The specifics are far
from certain at this point.

Over the northern and central Rockies into the Intermountain
region, models continue to signal for increasing amounts of
upslope/mountain snow under a tight pressure gradient behind the
arctic front late this week into the weekend.  Meanwhile, three
Pacific systems are forecast to move into the West Coast during
the medium range focusing across the Pacific Northwest and down
into northern California with reasonable model spread.

Along a wavy/stationary boundary in the Gulf, models are in good
agreement for a period of enhanced rainfall to overspread the Gulf
Coast States likely inland focuses for the interior Southeast.

Temperature wise, the frigid air will continue over the Northern
Plains, Northern Rockies, and Upper Midwest for much of the period
where anomalies of 30-45F are forecast across the middle of the
country. This is expected to slowly overspread, but moderate
somewhat, across much of the country by the end of the forecast
period.

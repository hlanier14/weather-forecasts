Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1101 AM CST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

Across portions of central and eastern MT, very strong winds and dry
fuels are resulting in locally enhanced fire-weather conditions.
Despite higher RH (30-35%) across the region, strong winds and
ongoing fires support an Elevated delineation.

Elevated to brief Critical fire-weather conditions are anticipated
across portions of southern California today, with the best overlap
of low RH and breezy offshore surface winds developing by late this
morning and lasting through the afternoon. Current surface
observations across this area depict very poor overnight RH
recoveries (currently in the 10-20% range) primarily away from the
immediate coast and along the higher terrain. Further RH reductions
can be expected as the offshore pressure gradient strengthens over
the next several hours and clear skies foster enhanced diurnal
heating/mixing. Brief Critical conditions will also be possible,
particularly across terrain-favored areas of Ventura County -- where
high-resolution model guidance suggests wind gusts of 20-30 mph
(isolated 45 mph) will be possible amid the critically low RH.

Locally Elevated fire-weather conditions are possible across
portions of the central High Plains this afternoon as downslope
warming/drying results in RH values near 20% with modest westerly
surface winds (15 to 20 mph with higher gusts). However, the
anticipated short duration of wind/RH overlap and marginal wind
speeds cast some uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 12/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1236 AM CST Wed Dec 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly flow will remain in place across the CONUS as a
weak upper-level trough translates across the Midwest/East Coast
through the day. The upper-level cutoff low over Baja California is
forecast to meander closer to the southern CA coast over the next 24
hours. While this will help ease the offshore pressure gradient by
late this afternoon/evening, northeasterly downslope flow will
maintain a fire weather concern for coastal southern CA for at least
the first half of the day. Elsewhere, westerly downslope flow is
expected across the central High Plains and may result in localized
fire weather concerns.

...Southern California...
Early morning observations from the coastal foothills and mountains
show modest east/northeasterly flow, which is yielding poor
overnight RH recoveries. Humidity values in the upper teens and low
20s are forecast to fall into the upper single digits and low teens
by late morning/early afternoon as winds strengthen in response to a
tightening pressure gradient. Ensemble solutions suggest winds
between 15-25 mph are likely with gusts between 20-35 mph possible
(primarily within the higher terrain). Given antecedent dry
conditions across the region, elevated fire weather conditions are
expected and localized critical conditions are possible, especially
across Los Angeles/Ventura counties where both ensemble and
deterministic solutions continue to show the strongest wind signal.
A weakening pressure gradient this evening should begin to limit the
fire weather potential, though wind-prone locations may continue to
see elevated conditions into the overnight hours.

...Central High Plains...
Latest surface pressure observations and analyses show a surface low
deepening in the lee of the Canadian Rockies. This feature will
translate eastward across the Canadian Plains through the day,
establishing a broad pressure gradient across the northern and
central Plains. Resulting westerly winds across the greater CO/NE/KS
region are forecast to strengthen into the 15-20 mph range with
gusts up to 25 mph possible. Downslope effects off the central
Rockies may support areas of reduced RH into the 20-35% range and
periods of elevated fire weather conditions. However, confidence in
the coverage of RH near 20% remains too low to introduce a risk
area.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 04 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal upper flow expected to be in place to begin the
weekend across the northern tier states should amplify into a
broad mean trough thereafter as an upper ridge strengthens over
the eastern Pacific.  Within this pattern a weak leading
shortwave/surface system will reach the East Coast early in the
weekend, followed by two more significant storm systems--one
tracking from the northern Plains into southeastern
Canada/Northeast U.S. from the weekend through Monday and the
second tracking from the West through the Plains and into the Ohio
Valley/Mid-South Monday-Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The relatively greater proportion of uncertainty in the forecast
still seems to emanate from question marks within multiple streams
of an upper trough over the east-central Pacific.  Leading energy
reaching the Northwest by early Saturday and the associated
surface reflection have trended closer together in the past 24
hours, though the new 12Z GFS run is already a bit more amplified
than consensus at that time.  Then as this energy amplifies
downstream to produce a Plains into eastern U.S./Canada low and
frontal system, recent ECMWF/CMC trends have been more in the
direction of, though not completely to, the deep and northwest
GFS.  Over the past day the UKMET has been very inconsistent with
the 00Z run quite suppressed for a time versus 12Z runs that have
been more like some GFS runs.

The character of the next shortwave nearing the Northwest early
next week will depend on how much if any interaction there may be
between northern stream energy just south of Alaska and a separate
upper low farther south, with no clear consensus evident yet for
exactly what will happen.  Detail differences at this "decision
point" ultimately lead to meaningful amplitude and timing
differences as the energy drops into the broad mean trough over
the lower 48.  Additional weaker energy could drop down behind
this shortwave as well.  On the positive side the more extreme
solutions from some earlier model runs have moderated somewhat,
leading to somewhat better comparisons among the models and means
on average by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.  This tendency has also
improved consensus toward longer persistence of the upper low over
or near Baja California.

The first half of the forecast incorporated the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/CMC, with the UKMET excluded due to poor comparison to
other guidance for the system reaching the Plains during the
weekend.  A blend of the aforementioned models along with the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means represented the pattern well while accounting
for lower confidence detail specifics after early Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A weak leading system may brush parts of the upper Great Lakes and
Northeast with light precipitation (mostly snow) on Saturday.
Solutions are gradually coming closer together for the next
stronger system from the weekend into Monday, with some potential
for a band of meaningful snow from parts of North Dakota into the
upper Great Lakes.  Precipitation type and intensity over the
eastern Great lakes and New England will depend on the exact low
track.  Moisture increasing ahead of the cold front should yield
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep South to
the Ohio Valley over the weekend.  There could be some locally
moderate to heavy rain embedded within this area but with fairly
low confidence in exactly where at this time.  The shortwave and
cold front forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night
and through Monday should produce a period of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows over western Washington and Oregon,
with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies by
Tuesday.  Heavy snow will be possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.  Some
moisture will extend farther south over favored terrain in the
Great Basin and central Rockies.  By next Tuesday-Wednesday,
Plains into eastern U.S. low pressure and associated fronts are
likely to generate another episode of showers and some storms with
highest totals between the Ohio Valley and Lower Mississippi
Valley.  At least some precipitation should be in the form of snow
to the north of this rain area.

Expect temperatures to be above normal for early December across
most of the nation through early next week.  The greatest positive
anomalies should be over the north-central High Plains and
vicinity on Saturday with highs 15-20F or so above average,
followed by another episode of similar anomalies over parts of
Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday ahead of the next cold front.  On
the other end of the spectrum, cold weather will likely continue
across the Northeast U.S. with highs running up to 10 degrees
below normal through the weekend with a cold upper level trough
overhead.  Behind the Sunday-Monday storm system and north of the
next one, areas along the extreme northern tier from the Plains
into New England may see moderately below normal highs from Monday
into Wednesday.  No major arctic airmass intrusions are expected
during this forecast period though.

300 PM EST December 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to move across Alaska during
week-2, resulting in below normal temperatures across the western Mainland,
and
spreading eastward across the southern half of the state and the Panhandle =
by
the middle of the period. This feature is likely to result in enhanced Paci=
fic
flow across the Northwest contiguous U.S., bringing rounds of heavy
precipitation (coastal rain and high elevation snow) to parts of the Pacifi=
c
Northwest and Northern California. Downstream across the eastern U.S., the
pattern looks more tranquil with model guidance trending toward more expans=
ive
mid-level high pressure. The only concern is enhanced return flow and front=
al
activity over the east-central U.S., with the strongest signals in the midd=
le
of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Pacific Northwest an=
d
Northern California, Thu-Wed, Dec 9-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi Valley, and the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Sat-Mon, Dec 11-13.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Great Basin, Thu, Dec 9.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Cascades, Thu-Wed, Dec 9-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of extreme weste=
rn
Mainland Alaska, Thu-Wed, Dec 9-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across southern Mainland Alas=
ka,
the Alaska Peninsula, and the Alaska Panhandle, Sat-Wed, Dec 11-15.

Flooding possible across portions of northwest Washington.

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 09 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 15: An amplified pattern is
forecast across the North Pacific, with troughing initially forecast over t=
he
northern Bering Sea, ridging to the south of the Aleutians, and additional
troughing across the western CONUS and Canada. The ridging is forecast to
expand northward, causing the Bering Sea trough to shift eastward across
Alaska
early in the period. The evolution of anomalous cold across Alaska is
dependent
on the timing of the trough, as well as how strong the upstream ridging
becomes. Based on the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, parts of extreme
western
Mainland Alaska have at least a 20% chance of having temperatures fall belo=
w
the 15th climatological percentile each day of the period corresponding wit=
h a
slight risk for much below normal temperatures. As the trough moves further=
 to
the east, the largest negative temperature anomalies are forecast to expand
into the remainder of the southern Mainland, the Alaska Peninsula, and
eventually to the Panhandle by the end of the period, indicated by another
slight risk of much below normal temperatures for these areas from 12/11 to
12/15. Minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F are indicated by
the
uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF guidance over both hazard areas, with the
deterministic 0z and 6z GEFS solutions depicting interior portions of the
Mainland having temperatures fall below -20 deg F. The GEFS is more aggress=
ive
expanding the aforementioned ridge over western Alaska late in week-2, whic=
h
would result in a moderation of temperatures. However, the ECMWF ensemble i=
s
more amplified with the troughing compared to the GEFS, and continues to
persist elevated chances of below normal temperatures for a longer duration=
,
allowing both hazards to continue through the end of the period.



The orientation of the mid-level heights across the North Pacific supports
enhanced moisture flow over the northwestern CONUS during week-2, with the
GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles indicating elevated probabilities (40-60%) of integrate=
d
vapor transport exceeding 250 kg/m/s. The more amplified ECMWF ensemble
persists these enhanced probabilities throughout all of week-2. This would
favor enhanced chances of heavy precipitation across the Pacific Northwest =
and
northern California, and the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at le=
ast
a 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentil=
e
and 2 inches over parts of those areas throughout week-2, supporting a slig=
ht
risk for heavy precipitation. Ongoing river flooding across northwestern
Washington, combined with heavy rainfall forecast during week-1 (greater th=
an
3
inches), favors a continuation of the flooding threat during week-2, with a
flooding possible region highlighted in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs o=
utlook. Heavy rainfall is
anticipated for lower elevation areas, whereas higher elevation areas of th=
e
Cascades are likely to receive heavy snow (at least 12 inches in a 24-hour
period over parts of the highlighted region per deterministic GFS guidance)=
,
corresponding with an accompanying slight risk of heavy snow for all of
week-2.
Late in week-1, surface low development over the Rockies may increase chanc=
es
for heavy snow over the higher elevations of the Northern Great Basin and
Northern Rockies, and heavy snow may linger into day-8. Therefore, a slight
risk for heavy snow is indicated over these areas on 12/9.



Dynamical models continue to depict longwave troughing across north-central
Canada and the southern Arctic during week-2, associated with negative 500-=
hPa
height anomalies over most of Canada and extending through the North Atlant=
ic.
The ECMWF ensemble depicts a shortwave trough propagating through the Great
Lakes and Northeast late in week-1, bringing relatively cooler temperatures=
 to
these areas at the start of week-2. However, the GEFS is not as robust with
this shortwave, and both models have now trended toward more ridging and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies across the East, favoring above normal
temperatures for the period as a whole. Return southerly flow around surfac=
e
high pressure forecast near the East Coast, combined with shortwave energy
associated with cyclonic mid-level flow over the western CONUS, favors an
enhanced baroclinic zone setting up over the east-central CONUS. Both the G=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 PM CST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this outlook. Breezy west-northwesterly surface winds and
marginally low RH (upper 20s to upper 30s) will develop over
portions of central and eastern Montana on Thursday afternoon,
resulting in lingering fire-weather concerns. However, the overlap
of enhanced winds and low RH appears too marginal and brief to
introduce highlights at this time.

Across portions of South Carolina, brief Elevated fire-weather
conditions may develop during the afternoon hours as enhanced
northwesterly midlevel flow overspreads a dry antecedent airmass.
Efficient diurnal heating/mixing should result in RHs of 30-35
percent, with wind gusts up to 25 mph. Presently, the overall
fire-weather threat appears too localized for any delineations,
though trends will be monitored.

For details on the High Plains and Mid-Atlantic fire-weather
threats, please see the previous forecast below.

..Weinman/Bentley.. 12/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CST Wed Dec 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad long-wave ridging is expected to become entrenched across the
western two-thirds of the CONUS through D2/Thursday. This will help
maintain dry, but relatively calm, conditions across the West.
Further east, an upper-level trough translating across the Eastern
U.S. will bring scattered rain chances along with breezy winds to
parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

...Southern California...
The upper-level cutoff low currently along the coast of Baja
California is expected to linger just off the southern CA coast
through early Thursday. This may continue to support
east/northeasterly flow over the coastal mountains, resulting in
pockets of breezy downslope winds and elevated fire weather
conditions. In general, this threat appears too spatially limited to
warrant a risk area, but trends will continue to be monitored.

...Southern High Plains...
A weak lee trough developing across the central High Plains Thursday
afternoon should support breezy westerly winds off the southern
Rockies and into eastern NM. Downslope warming/drying may result in
RH reductions into the low 20s and teens. With dry fuels already in
place, elevated fire weather conditions are possible. However, most
solutions hint at a relatively localized threat confined mainly the
lee side of terrain in eastern NM. Ensemble probabilities support
this idea, which precludes highlights at this time. If guidance
trends towards windier solutions then highlights may be introduced
in subsequent updates.

...Mid-Atlantic...
An upper-level wave and attendant surface low are forecast to
translate across New England/southeast Canada through the day
Thursday. Westerly pressure gradient winds will likely increase to
10-15 mph with stronger winds possible in the immediate lee of the
Blue Ridge Mountains. Most guidance suggest RH values in the coastal
plain will be slightly dry compared to seasonal normals, but
downslope warming/drying in the lee of the terrain might support
local RH reductions close to 30%. If this occurs, dry fuels (10-hour
fuel moisture values between 5-10%) may support a fire weather
concern. However, the potential for scattered rain showers and cloud
cover casts some uncertainty into this scenario. Trends will
continue to be monitored.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed December 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 07 - 11 2021

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement on the predicted 500-h=
Pa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period.  In the mean mid-level height field, strong ridging near t=
he
southwestern Aleutians is forecast, leading to anticipated troughing
downstream
across Alaska. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are likely over most of
the
southern CONUS, while mean troughing with below normal 500-hPa heights is
predicted over the north-central CONUS. Due to recent model performance,
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height blend forecast give=
s equal weight to the GEFS
and
ECMWF ensemble means and less weight to the Canadian ensemble means.

Troughing over the north-central CONUS leads to increased chances of below
normal temperatures over parts of the Great Lakes region. Ridging and near =
to
above normal 500-hPa heights during the period favors near to above normal
temperatures over the remainder of the CONUS. Troughing forecast over much =
of
Alaska leads to increased chances of near to below normal temperatures acro=
ss
most of the state, consistent with the Auto Blend temperature forecast tool=
.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above normal
precipitation over much of the western CONUS and most of the Northern Plain=
s.
Near to above normal precipitation is also favored over most of the eastern
CONUS, based on a frontal passage. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored across parts of the Florida Peninsula, due to the storm track
remaining
northward of the Gulf Coast. Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lea=

to
increased chances of near to above normal precipitation across Alaska,
supported by the operational Autoblend and consolidation precipitation

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 09 - 15 2021

In the week-2 period,  strong ridging and associated positive 500-hPa heigh=
t
anomalies continue to be forecast near the southwestern Aleutians. Troughin=
g
over Alaska is likely to persist into week-2 and extend southward to the
northwestern CONUS. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights  are forecast over
most of the southern and eastern CONUS.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast in week-2 for
nearly all of Alaska as well as western Washington underneath predicted
troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Forecast near to above normal
500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above normal temperatures acro=
ss
the remainder of the CONUS. This is also consistent with the consolidation
temperature forecast tool.

Near to above normal precipitation is favored across most of the western
CONUS,
due to troughing and enhanced Pacific flow predicted across the Northwest
Coast. Near to below normal precipitation is favored over parts of the Grea=
t
Plains region and Florida due to the forecast above normal heights. Above
normal precipitation is favored over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes and Northeast due to forecast
frontal passages. Probabilities of near to above normal precipitation are
slightly elevated for Alaska, underneath mean cyclonic mid-level flow.

...Widespread record breaking temperatures likely from Northwest
into Great Plains through Thursday; Elevated Fire Weather Risk for
Southern California...

...Lingering rain over the Pacific Northwest...

...Light rain and snow showers over portions of the Great Lakes
and Northeast through midweek...

High pressure dominance in the West will contribute to record
breaking mild weather across the western half of the Lower 48.
Unseasonably warm temperatures 25-30 degrees above normal
(translating to highs in the 60's and 70's) will threaten high
temperature records this afternoon over the West and Central U.S.
as an anomalously strong upper-ridge over the Great Basin expands
toward the Rockies. Later today, many overnight low temperature
records could fall over the Northern Rockies, down through the
Front Range and into the Northern/Central Plains. Another shot of
record breaking warmth will expand into the Southern Plains
tomorrow, with some locations flirting with 80 degree highs as
height rises and warm southwesterly flow set in. Locations east of
the Mississippi River will miss out on record breaking warmth, but
will enter a general warming trend through Friday before the next
cold front moderates temperatures to around seasonal. The warm
weather working with strong winds may exasperate fire weather
conditions over portions of East-Central Montana and Southern
California, where the Storm Prediction Center highlights an
Elevated Fire Weather risk today. Fire aside, strong downslope
winds could produce hazardous wind gusts up to 90 mph along the
Rocky Mountain Front today in Montana, where High Wind Warning is
in effect.

Over Northwest Washington, the Atmospheric River event has largely
ended, and should completely subside by tomorrow. Meanwhile, a
strengthening Clipper system will produce another round of light
rain and snow for the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Central
Appalachians and Northeast over the next couple of days. In
general, most of the precipitation over the CONUS will remain
relegated to the northern third of the U.S. as the upper-level
troughing pattern is confined to southern Canada. However, rain
and snow totals will remain negligible over the next 48 hours,
with some local upslope enhancement possible over the Adirondacks
and Vermont/New Hampshire mountains. Some rain shower activity may
develop as far south as the Ohio Valley and the Central
Appalachians as a warm front lifts through the region this
afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
536 PM EST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 04 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal upper flow expected to be in place to begin the
weekend across the northern tier states should amplify into a
broad mean trough thereafter as an upper ridge strengthens over
the eastern Pacific.  Within this pattern a weak leading
shortwave/surface system will reach the East Coast early in the
weekend, followed by two more significant storm systems--one
tracking from the northern Plains into southeastern
Canada/Northeast U.S. from the weekend through Monday and the
second tracking from the West through the Plains and into the Ohio
Valley/Mid-South Monday-Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The relatively greater proportion of uncertainty in the forecast
still seems to emanate from question marks within multiple streams
of an upper trough over the east-central Pacific.  Leading energy
reaching the Northwest by early Saturday and the associated
surface reflection have trended closer together in the past 24
hours, though the new 12Z GFS run is already a bit more amplified
than consensus at that time.  Then as this energy amplifies
downstream to produce a Plains into eastern U.S./Canada low and
frontal system, recent ECMWF/CMC trends have been more in the
direction of, though not completely to, the deep and northwest
GFS.  Over the past day the UKMET has been very inconsistent with
the 00Z run quite suppressed for a time versus 12Z runs that have
been more like some GFS runs.

The character of the next shortwave nearing the Northwest early
next week will depend on how much if any interaction there may be
between northern stream energy just south of Alaska and a separate
upper low farther south, with no clear consensus evident yet for
exactly what will happen.  Detail differences at this "decision
point" ultimately lead to meaningful amplitude and timing
differences as the energy drops into the broad mean trough over
the lower 48.  Additional weaker energy could drop down behind
this shortwave as well.  On the positive side the more extreme
solutions from some earlier model runs have moderated somewhat,
leading to somewhat better comparisons among the models and means
on average by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.  This tendency has also
improved consensus toward longer persistence of the upper low over
or near Baja California.

The first half of the forecast incorporated the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/CMC, with the UKMET excluded due to poor comparison to
other guidance for the system reaching the Plains during the
weekend.  A blend of the aforementioned models along with the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means represented the pattern well while accounting
for lower confidence detail specifics after early Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A weak leading system may brush parts of the upper Great Lakes and
Northeast with light precipitation (mostly snow) on Saturday.
Solutions are gradually coming closer together for the next
stronger system from the weekend into Monday, with some potential
for a band of meaningful snow from parts of North Dakota into the
upper Great Lakes.  Precipitation type and intensity over the
eastern Great lakes and New England will depend on the exact low
track.  Moisture increasing ahead of the cold front should yield
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep South to
the Ohio Valley over the weekend.  There could be some locally
moderate to heavy rain embedded within this area but with fairly
low confidence in exactly where at this time.  The shortwave and
cold front forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night
and through Monday should produce a period of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows over western Washington and Oregon,
with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies by
Tuesday.  Heavy snow will be possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.  Some
moisture will extend farther south over favored terrain in the
Great Basin and central Rockies.  By next Tuesday-Wednesday,
Plains into eastern U.S. low pressure and associated fronts are
likely to generate another episode of showers and some storms with
highest totals between the Ohio Valley and Lower Mississippi
Valley.  At least some precipitation should be in the form of snow
to the north of this rain area.

Expect temperatures to be above normal for early December across
most of the nation through early next week.  The greatest positive
anomalies should be over the north-central High Plains and
vicinity on Saturday with highs 15-20F or so above average,
followed by another episode of similar anomalies over parts of
Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday ahead of the next cold front.  On
the other end of the spectrum, cold weather will likely continue
across the Northeast U.S. with highs running up to 10 degrees
below normal through the weekend with a cold upper level trough
overhead.  Behind the Sunday-Monday storm system and north of the
next one, areas along the extreme northern tier from the Plains
into New England may see moderately below normal highs from Monday
into Wednesday.  No major arctic airmass intrusions are expected
during this forecast period though.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
536 PM EST Wed Dec 01 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 04 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal upper flow expected to be in place to begin the
weekend across the northern tier states should amplify into a
broad mean trough thereafter as an upper ridge strengthens over
the eastern Pacific.  Within this pattern a weak leading
shortwave/surface system will reach the East Coast early in the
weekend, followed by two more significant storm systems--one
tracking from the northern Plains into southeastern
Canada/Northeast U.S. from the weekend through Monday and the
second tracking from the West through the Plains and into the Ohio
Valley/Mid-South Monday-Wednesday.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The relatively greater proportion of uncertainty in the forecast
still seems to emanate from question marks within multiple streams
of an upper trough over the east-central Pacific.  Leading energy
reaching the Northwest by early Saturday and the associated
surface reflection have trended closer together in the past 24
hours, though the new 12Z GFS run is already a bit more amplified
than consensus at that time.  Then as this energy amplifies
downstream to produce a Plains into eastern U.S./Canada low and
frontal system, recent ECMWF/CMC trends have been more in the
direction of, though not completely to, the deep and northwest
GFS.  Over the past day the UKMET has been very inconsistent with
the 00Z run quite suppressed for a time versus 12Z runs that have
been more like some GFS runs.

The character of the next shortwave nearing the Northwest early
next week will depend on how much if any interaction there may be
between northern stream energy just south of Alaska and a separate
upper low farther south, with no clear consensus evident yet for
exactly what will happen.  Detail differences at this "decision
point" ultimately lead to meaningful amplitude and timing
differences as the energy drops into the broad mean trough over
the lower 48.  Additional weaker energy could drop down behind
this shortwave as well.  On the positive side the more extreme
solutions from some earlier model runs have moderated somewhat,
leading to somewhat better comparisons among the models and means
on average by days 6-7 Tuesday-Wednesday.  This tendency has also
improved consensus toward longer persistence of the upper low over
or near Baja California.

The first half of the forecast incorporated the 00Z/06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/CMC, with the UKMET excluded due to poor comparison to
other guidance for the system reaching the Plains during the
weekend.  A blend of the aforementioned models along with the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means represented the pattern well while accounting
for lower confidence detail specifics after early Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A weak leading system may brush parts of the upper Great Lakes and
Northeast with light precipitation (mostly snow) on Saturday.
Solutions are gradually coming closer together for the next
stronger system from the weekend into Monday, with some potential
for a band of meaningful snow from parts of North Dakota into the
upper Great Lakes.  Precipitation type and intensity over the
eastern Great lakes and New England will depend on the exact low
track.  Moisture increasing ahead of the cold front should yield
scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep South to
the Ohio Valley over the weekend.  There could be some locally
moderate to heavy rain embedded within this area but with fairly
low confidence in exactly where at this time.  The shortwave and
cold front forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night
and through Monday should produce a period of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows over western Washington and Oregon,
with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies by
Tuesday.  Heavy snow will be possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.  Some
moisture will extend farther south over favored terrain in the
Great Basin and central Rockies.  By next Tuesday-Wednesday,
Plains into eastern U.S. low pressure and associated fronts are
likely to generate another episode of showers and some storms with
highest totals between the Ohio Valley and Lower Mississippi
Valley.  At least some precipitation should be in the form of snow
to the north of this rain area.

Expect temperatures to be above normal for early December across
most of the nation through early next week.  The greatest positive
anomalies should be over the north-central High Plains and
vicinity on Saturday with highs 15-20F or so above average,
followed by another episode of similar anomalies over parts of
Texas and Oklahoma on Tuesday ahead of the next cold front.  On
the other end of the spectrum, cold weather will likely continue
across the Northeast U.S. with highs running up to 10 degrees
below normal through the weekend with a cold upper level trough
overhead.  Behind the Sunday-Monday storm system and north of the
next one, areas along the extreme northern tier from the Plains
into New England may see moderately below normal highs from Monday
into Wednesday.  No major arctic airmass intrusions are expected
during this forecast period though.

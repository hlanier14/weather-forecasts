Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN AND CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO INTO THE SAN LUIS VALLEY...

Sunny skies prevail across the Southwest, promoting ample diurnal
heating/boundary-layer mixing to support Elevated to Critical
surface fire weather conditions, particularly across western into
central New Mexico northward to the San Luis Valley in south-central
Colorado. As such, the previous forecast (see below) remains on
track, with no changes or additions made.

..Squitieri.. 04/16/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and accompanying strong/deep west-southwesterly
flow will advance eastward across the Southwest today, while surface
low pressure develops across the Great Basin.

...Southwest into the Central and Southern Rockies...
Ahead of the approaching midlevel trough, deep boundary-layer mixing
will result in widespread minimum RH of 10-15 percent this
afternoon. At the same time, breezy west-southwesterly surface winds
of 20-25 mph (with higher gusts) will overspread modestly receptive
fuels. The best overlap of strong surface winds and critically low
RH is expected over parts of New Mexico into south-central Colorado,
where Critical highlights are in place. Very dry and breezy
conditions are also expected over Arizona, though fuels are not as
receptive to wildfire-spread at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 PM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR NORTHEAST COLORADO
INTO SOUTHWESTERN NEBRASKA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN COLORADO INTO
CENTRAL NEW MEXICO ALONG THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES...

The two Elevated delineations have been joined into a single area,
as the latest guidance consensus suggests dry downslope flow will
envelop much of the central and southern lee of the Rockies
tomorrow/Sunday. Within the broader Elevated, two separate regimes
exist where Critical fire weather conditions may occur. Across the
central Plains (especially western Nebraska and immediate adjacent
areas), a 75+ kt mid-level jet streak will overspread the Critical
area by afternoon peak heating. Downslope flow and downward momentum
transport in a dry boundary layer behind a surface cold front will
encourage 20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid 15-25
percent RH, atop fuels with forecast ERCs around the 90th
percentile. Critical conditions along the lee of the Rockies (from
southern Colorado into central New Mexico) will be driven primarily
by downslope flow, comprised of 20+ mph sustained westerly surface
winds coinciding with 10-15 percent RH. Forecast ERCs across
portions of the southern Critical delineation are also approaching
90 percent in spots, suggesting that fuels should be quite receptive
to fire spread.

..Squitieri.. 04/16/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong midlevel westerly flow will overspread the Rockies,
resulting in surface lee troughing and dry boundary-layer conditions
over the High Plains. Late in the period, a cold front will sweep
southward across the central High Plains, with breezy northerly
surface winds persisting in its wake.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Downslope warming/drying accompanying the enhanced midlevel westerly
flow will result in 20-25 percent minimum RH over the central High
Plains, where strong west-northwesterly surface winds of 20-25 mph
will be possible. The combination of dry/windy conditions and
critically dry fuels will support high-end elevated conditions. If
guidance trends any lower with RH across this region, Critical
highlights could be needed. Farther south, a drier airmass
characterized by 10-15 percent minimum RH will develop. However,
current indications are that breezy surface winds of 15-20 mph will
generally be brief in duration.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
243 PM EDT Sat Apr 16 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 19 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 23 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...
An active northern stream pattern over the CONUS likely culminates
in a large, closed low over the West Coast Thursday, perhaps into
Friday. Two lows/troughs track ahead of this low, one that lifts
north of New England on Wednesday and one that tracks from the
Northern Plains to New England by way of the northern Great Lakes
Tuesday night through Thursday night. Amplified ridging and above
normal temperatures occur between these three lows/troughs.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...
The overall synoptic depiction of the pattern is very strong in
deterministic guidance until Thursday when the 06Z GFS opens the
low off the Pacific Northwest, making it more progressive that
other guidance with a shortwave trough that reaches the northern
Plains by 12Z Saturday while the 00Z ECMWF/CMC keep a closed low
over the Desert SW through that time. The 12Z GFS is a bit slower,
but the trough still crosses the CO Rockies by 12Z Saturday.
Otherwise, the global deterministic guidance is in good agreement.
The WPC forecast was derived from a multi-deterministic blend
through Day 5/Wednesday night before favoring the ECMWF/CMC and
ensemble means from the GEFS/ECENS/CMCE.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...
Far northern CA into OR have precipitation in the forecast for
each of the four medium range days from back-to-back systems, the
second one stalling and potentially working south through much of
the rest of CA Friday into the weekend. This late season event
will deliver highly beneficial rainfall/mountain snow to
drought-stricken areas of California, with the potential for three
inches of liquid for most northern CA terrain with a few feet of
snow for the Sierra. Elsewhere across the continental U.S., the
deep low lifting from New England Tuesday night will allow
continued wrap around snow over Interior New England terrain into
Wednesday. The next wave to cross the northern Plains looks to
push most of its snow into the Canadian Prairies through midweek
while another round of organized showers and storms are likely to
develop across the central U.S. and extending northward to the
Great Lakes as Gulf moisture is advected northward ahead of the
organizing storm system. Heavy rain is possible, particularly over
the Ozarks to Mid-MS Valley Wednesday/Wednesday night.

Temperatures are expected to remain be below normal over the
northern Plains through next week, slowing the recovery/melt from
the recent blizzard as well as the expected snow tomorrow/Easter
Sunday. On the contrary, above normal temperatures are expected
across much of the interior western U.S. under ridging/south of
the midweek low passages over the northern Plains before shifting
east over the central/east-central portions of the CONUS into next
weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 16 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

...Heavy snow for the Northern Plains...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast and Southeast through
Sunday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies and the Central High Plains...

By Monday evening, low pressure over the Northern Rockies will
slowly move eastward to the Great Lakes. On Saturday evening, the
system will produce coastal/lower elevation rain and higher
elevation snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin,
and Northern Rockies. Overnight Saturday, the precipitation will
change over to mostly all snow over the Northern Rockies/Northern
High Plains, as snow starts over parts of the Northern/Central
Plains into parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley. On Sunday,
heavy snow will develop over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley while continuing over parts of the Northern
Rockies. Overnight Sunday, the snow will end over the Northern
Rockies as snow develops over parts of the Upper Great Lakes. On
Monday, the snow moves into the Lower Great Lakes and parts of the
Ohio Valley.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low over the Great Lakes will move off
the Northeast Coast by early Monday morning. The energy will aid
in producing lake-enhanced snow over parts of the Upper Great
Lakes overnight Saturday, moving to the Lower Great Lakes and
parts of Northern New England on Sunday. The snow and coastal rain
will continue over parts of Northern New England through Sunday
evening.

Additionally, the front extending from the Northeast across the
Central Appalachians over the Central Gulf Coast into the Southern
Plains moves off most of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday morning.
The boundary lingers over the Gulf Coast States into the Southern
Plains through Sunday evening. Rain will develop along the
boundary over parts of the Northeast to the Central Appalachians
through early Sunday morning. The front will also aid in
destabilizing the atmosphere over the Southern Plains to the
Southeast. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast
through Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. There will also be a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast.

On Sunday, a wave of low pressure will move along the front over
the Gulf Coast States that will continue to destabilize the
atmosphere over the region. Similarly, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Central Gulf Coast Sunday into Monday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. In addition,
the threat of excessive rainfall will move eastward over the
Southeast on Sunday while the showers and thunderstorms continue
over the region. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over the Southeast on Sunday into Monday
morning. The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams being the most vulnerable. Rain with embedded
thunderstorms will continue over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Monday.

Furthermore, late Sunday afternoon, a front over the Pacific will
begin to move onshore overnight Sunday, over the Pacific Northwest
into Monday. The system will produce coastal rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and Northern California
early Monday morning into Monday afternoon.

Moreover, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
the Southern Rockies through Sunday morning and over the Southern
Rockies into the Central High Plains on Sunday. The fire weather
hazard is due to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low humidity.

254 AM EDT Sun Apr 17 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Apr 20 2022 - 12Z Sun Apr 24 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...
The departure of the strong low pressure system from New England
will leave a surface high in its wake across the eastern U.S. on
Wednesday.  At the same time, an organizing storm system just
north of the Canadian border will bring a cold front eastward
across the north-central U.S. with a weakening low farther south
across the central Plains.  Attention then turns to the western
U.S. by Friday as an amplified upper level trough becomes
established over the Intermountain West, and this will support the
development of a potentially strong surface low over the
central/northern Plains in time for the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...
The 00Z model guidance suite appears to have above average
agreement on the main synoptic scale features through Thursday
night, with just some minor differences in cold front timing
across the Great Lakes and Midwest.  By Friday, the 18/00Z runs of
the GFS become more progressive with the axis of the main trough
axis across the western U.S., and this difference is even more
apparent going into Saturday across the High Plains.  Meanwhile,
the 00Z CMC and ECMWF are in close agreement and depict a closed
low evolving over the Desert Southwest by Friday night, and this
also has support from the 00Z UKMET.  The earlier 12Z run of the
CMC was much slower and on the edge of the ensemble spread.  This
trend continues through the weekend, and the model preference for
the later half of the forecast period is for a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS
blend as a starting point.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...
In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain active with a strong cold front and onshore flow
directed inland across the mountainous terrain of central and
northern California.  This late season event will deliver highly
beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken areas of California,
with the potential for up to three inches of rain in some areas
next week, and 1-3 feet of snow for the Sierra.  Elsewhere across
the continental U.S., improving weather can be expected for the
Northeast as the strong storm system moves out of the region.
Another round of organized showers and storms is expected to
develop across the central U.S. and extending northward to the
Great Lakes by mid-late week as Gulf moisture is advected
northward ahead of the organizing storm system over the central
Plains.  Additional moderate to heavy snow is also expected for
portions of the northern Rockies for Friday and into the weekend,
with some snow potentially affecting western portions of the
Dakotas by next weekend.

Temperatures are expected to remain rather chilly from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and Appalachians through about
Wednesday, and these below average readings may persist even
longer across North Dakota and northern Minnesota going through
the end of the week.  On the contrary, warm conditions are
currently expected across much of the interior western U.S. for
the majority of the forecast period ahead of the upper trough,
with well above normal readings probable across the western High
Plains by the end of the week and into Texas.  Temperatures should
also moderate for the Eastern U.S. by Thursday as the surface high
moves off the coast and warmer southerly flow commences.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS
AND SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES IN CO AND NM...

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude midlevel trough and accompanying strong
west-northwesterly flow will overspread the northern and central
Rockies, resulting in a deepening lee trough over the High Plains.
At the surface, low pressure will lift northeastward from western SD
into the Upper MS Valley, while an attendant cold front sweeps
southward across the central and southern High Plains.

...Central High Plains and southward along the lee of the Rockies in
CO and NM...
As the core of the strong/deep west-northwesterly flow impinges on
the central Rockies and adjacent High Plains, diurnal heating will
allow for the strong flow aloft to mix down to the surface. 20-30
mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts)
are expected from eastern WY into western NE and northeastern CO
behind the southward-advancing cold front. Here, a relatively cool
airmass could limit RH reductions to an extent, however, the
strong/gusty surface winds and very dry fuels will still result in
critical fire-weather conditions. Along the lee of the Rockies from
central CO into NM, downslope flow amid a warmer/drier antecedent
airmass will favor 10-15 percent minimum RH with 20-25 mph sustained
west-northwesterly surface winds.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post-frontal airmass will be in place across much of the
Mid-Atlantic (minimum RH of 20-30 percent), however, generally light
surface winds are expected where the lowest RH will develop.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Sun Apr 17 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge will build over the western CONUS, while modest
westerly midlevel flow persists over the Southwest. Farther east, a
strong midlevel trough will track eastward across the Middle MS
Valley, while breezy northwesterly surface winds develop across the
Middle MO Valley in its wake.

...Southwest into south-central CO...
Modest downslope flow will result in widespread 5-15 percent RH
during the afternoon, where sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds will approach 15 mph. The lack of a tighter surface pressure
gradient and modest midlevel flow should mitigate a higher-end
fire-weather threat, though elevated conditions are still expected.

...Middle MO Valley...
Sustained northwesterly surface winds near 15-25 mph will develop
amid 20-25 percent RH during peak heating. While these conditions
will be near-critical, light rainfall across the region casts
uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat. With that said, the
dry/breezy conditions combined with dry fuels should support at
least elevated conditions.

...March-like temperatures across the Northern Tier, heavy snow in
the Northern Plains & New England on Monday...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast and Southeast today and into
Monday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies and the Central High Plains...

A distinct divide in air-masses remains in place this Easter
Sunday with abnormally warm temperatures across the South and
unusually cold temperatures in the North. There are Hard Freeze
Warnings for parts of northern California with Freeze Warnings and
Frost Advisories in place across the Ohio Valley. A wave of low
pressure tracking through the northern Plains will deliver a round
of heavy snow to North Dakota and northern Minnesota today with
gusty winds also leading to reduced visibilities and drifting
snow. Winter Storm Warnings are in place over northern North
Dakota where snow accumulations could surpass 8 inches in spots.
In addition to the snow, Wind Advisories and High Wind Warnings
have been issued for parts of the Northern Plains and southeast
Wyoming. As the storm gradually weakens while tracking towards the
Great Lakes, light accumulations will be possible in the Great
Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley. Farther east, a deepening area
of low pressure in the Southeast will strengthen even further as
it tracks up the Eastern Seaboard on Monday. While there remains
some uncertainty regarding storm track and intensity, confidence
is growing on the likelihood of measurable snowfall in the
northern Appalachians on Monday. The latest WPC snowfall forecast
calls for a 3 to 6 inch snowstorm with locally higher totals
possible in the Catskills, Adirondacks, Berkshires, Green and
White mountains. Coastal areas of the Northeast can expect periods
of rain to envelope the Northeast coast, but gusty winds may also
contribute to terrible travel conditions and potentially downed
tree limbs.

Farther south, early summer-like temperatures will be most common
in the Southern High Plains and the Southwest where daytime highs
in the 80s and 90s are expected. In fact, portions of the Rio
Grande Valley in South Texas could soar as high as 100 degrees
today. In the Deep South, where a lingering frontal boundary will
act as a trigger for showers and thunderstorms, could lead to some
thunderstorms becoming severe. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC)
does have a Slight Risk  over the Lower Mississippi Valley but
there is also a a Threat for severe storms from the Rio Grande
Valley to the Georgia Coast. Given antecedent soil conditions
remain quite saturated, rainfall rates exceeding 1" per hour may
lead to areas of flash flooding later today.  By Monday, the cold
front associated with a deepening cyclone along the East Coast
means some light snowfall totals are also possible in the central
Appalachians. The heaviest rainfall amounts across the country are
likely to occur in the Southeast with rainfall amounts surpassing
2 inches in some parts of the Southeast. Drier air filtering
behind the cold front and a large dome of high pressure ushers in
a shot of cooler temperatures into the Deep South for the first
half of the upcoming week.

Elsewhere, the next Pacific storm system is set to usher in
another surge of Pacific moisture, leading to both heavy snow and
rain in some cases across the Pacific Northwest early in the day
on Monday. Snowfall accumulations exceeding a foot are possible,
especially in the higher elevations of the Cascades and at lower
snow levels in the Olympics. In the southern and central High
Plains, the combination of gusty winds, parched relative humidity
levels, and dry fuels have prompted the issuance of a Critical
Risk for Fire Weather this Easter Sunday. The threat for fire
weather conditions is not quite and concerning for Monday, but a
pair of Elevated Risk areas to remain in place for parts of the
Midwest and the Four Corners region.

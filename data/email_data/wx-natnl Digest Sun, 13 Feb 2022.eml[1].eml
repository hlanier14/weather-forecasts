Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CST Sat Feb 12 2022

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The overall forecast remains valid with no changes. Despite cool
surface temperatures and patchy snow cover, brief elevated fire
weather conditions may develop across portions of western NE and
eastern WY in response to gusty downslope winds. Uncertainty
regarding fuel availability and the temporal coverage of sustained
fire weather conditions suggests the threat will remain local in
nature. Elsewhere, elevated fire weather conditions remain likely
across portions of southern California and the southern Plains. See
below for additional details.

..Lyons.. 02/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CST Sat Feb 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
Regional fire weather concerns are expected again today as windy
conditions develop across the southern Plains and offshore winds
continue over coastal southern California.

...Southern Plains...
Morning surface observations show a cold front draped from the upper
OH River Valley into the southern Plains. This boundary will
continue to push south/southeast through the day and should reach
the northwestern Gulf by this afternoon. As this occurs, strong
gusty winds will develop along/behind the front amid strong
low-level cold advection. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph are
expected from southern TX to southern OK, and gusts up to 30-40 mph
will be possible. Drier air will continue to filter into the region
and may support RH reductions into the 20-30% range. Confidence in
elevated fire weather conditions remains highest across north TX and
southern OK where the probability of windy conditions overlapping
with sufficient dry air for at least 2-3 hours remains the highest.
While confidence is somewhat lower, elevated conditions may evolve
into southern TX late this afternoon, but fuel conditions are not as
receptive.

...Coastal Southern California...
Early-morning observations show elevated to critical wind/RH
conditions ongoing across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. These
conditions will persist through the morning to early afternoon hours
as the regional pressure gradient continues to strengthen. Latest
hi-res guidance suggests that the LAX-DAG pressure gradient will be
maximized between 12-18 UTC. While this doesn't align perfectly with
the diurnal cycle, persistent downslope flow will maintain 15-20% RH
values for much of the day. Wind gusts between 30-50 mph are likely
during this period and will support elevated to critical fire
weather conditions. Fire danger will be highest in areas that have
seen prolonged downslope flow and drier fine fuels, but a more
robust/widespread threat is not anticipated due to high live fuel
moisture.

...Central High Plains...
Elevated fire weather conditions may develop this afternoon across
southeast WY into adjacent areas of NE and CO. Downslope winds are
expected to increase to 15-25 mph across the central to northern
High Plains, and RH values are forecast to fall largely into the
25-35% range. A few locations over the central High Plains could
fall to near 20% where downslope flow may be stronger. However,
confidence in the coverage and duration of these conditions is low
and mainly depicted by more aggressive model solutions. Although
recent observations are in line with more modest ensemble means, RH
trends will be monitored given the relatively dry fuel conditions
across the region.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to east-central U.S. and
wintry weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be a sharp
upper trough likely centered from the northern Rockies through
California as of early Tuesday. This feature, possibly containing
an upper low for a brief time, will track eastward through midweek
and then become incorporated into a Plains/east-central U.S. mean
trough. This evolution aloft will lead to surface cyclogenesis and
strong frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable
precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into Friday.
Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and
wintry weather are likely on the northern and western side of the
precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.  By
Friday-Saturday expect a weaker clipper system tracking near the
Canadian border to bring a cold front into the northern tier while
a steadily weakening (but initially quite strong) eastern Pacific
upper ridge drifts toward the West Coast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and ensembles have been showing some incremental
adjustments for the upper system initially dropping into the West
and associated surface evolution through the week. To start the
period, guidance is keeping the western trough a little more open
and by early day 4 Wednesday gives mixed signals for whether there
will be a closed low--though still with majority support to favor
showing one in a single deterministic forecast. Either way the
recent trends have been for a more open feature as it ejects into
the Plains, leading to a somewhat weaker and faster surface system
from the Plains through Midwest and Great Lakes. Low pressure does
eventually strengthen farther northeastward as northern stream
dynamics increasingly influence the system. Latest CMC runs stray
southwest of other solutions with the western upper system and
then shear it out more dramatically farther east, resulting in a
weaker surface pattern. An average of GFS/ECMWF/UKMET runs from
the 00Z/06Z cycles provided a measured adjustment from continuity.
It will be interesting to see if persistence of a weaker scenario
in the CMC foreshadows additional weakening/progression in other
solutions, such as seen in the new 12Z ECMWF. Beyond the early
period detail differences, the combination of upstream energy
diving into/through the West from Wednesday onward and northern
stream troughing that reaches the Plains/Mississippi Valley still
contribute to some of the uncertainty in forecasts of this system
over the course of the period. Lingering southern tier shortwave
energy, with fairly low predictability for specifics, may have an
effect on frontal waviness and precipitation toward the end of the
period.

Elsewhere, continuity is fairly good in principle for the system
forecast to track near the Canadian border/Upper Great Lakes
around Friday-Saturday while typical differences exist for precise
timing of the trailing front. Models vary for a weak and
small-scale shortwave rounding the Pacific upper ridge and then
dropping into the West late in the period. Confidence is currently
minimal for specifics of this feature. However there is decent
agreement on an upstream shortwave/cold front approaching the
Pacific Northwest later next Saturday.

Preferences for the system over the West and continuing eastward
favored starting the forecast with the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and 00Z
UKMET for about the first half of the period. Then the blend
incorporated some of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means by days 6-7
Friday-Saturday given decreasing confidence in some details.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Underneath the upper low/trough over the West Tuesday into
Wednesday, expect light to moderate precipitation in the form of
lower elevation rain and mountain snow to spread from California
and Great Basin/Northern Rockies into the Central Rockies. Showers
and thunderstorms will become more widespread over the central
U.S. by Wednesday into Thursday as surface low pressure
consolidates in the High Plains and advects substantial moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Plains,
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and eventually the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms are possible,
with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe
threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi
and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and Thursday.
There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy rainfall
occurs, possibly in similar regions and into the Southern
Appalachians. Continue to monitor forecasts as uncertain details
of these potential threats become better refined. At the same
time, expect a band of snow in the colder air on the northwestern
periphery of the system. The best potential for meaningful
accumulations currently extends from central parts of the Plains
and Midwest/Middle Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes region
and interior New England, while mixed precipitation/ice cannot be
ruled out in the transition zone between the snow and rain.
Totals/location of any snow will be very sensitive to precise
strength and track of the system, and wintry weather could be
within a fairly narrow band. Strong winds may be possible in the
gradient between the surface low and high pressure to the
northwest, and then possibly along parts of the East Coast within
the southerly flow ahead of the system. Recent trends toward low
pressure being weaker and faster, at least from the Plains through
Ohio Valley/Great Lakes, could temper snowfall and wind speeds
somewhat.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system. By Friday or Saturday the system along the Canadian
border may bring some snow into the Upper Great Lakes while a
little light precipitation may reach the northern Pacific
Northwest/Rockies. Some moisture may linger over the far
Southeast/Florida but with low confidence in coverage and
intensity of rainfall at this time.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward through the workweek ahead of
the trough/frontal system and cooler temperatures spread behind
the cold front. Highs of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F
above normal will be shunted from the Plains on Tuesday into the
Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys (while persisting in the Southern
Plains) on Wednesday, then into the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday.
Some lows in the East could challenge daily records for warmth if
they hold for the calendar day. On the backside of the front,
temperatures should flip to near or below average, first over the
West and spreading to the Rockies, Plains, and Midwest Wednesday
and Thursday before tracking into the eastern third of the country
for the latter part of the week while moderating. Best potential
for temperatures 10-20F below average will be over the southern
half of the Rockies/High Plains and Upper Midwest into the Great
Lakes. An increasing portion of the West and eventually the Plains
should warm up to above average once again by the end of the week.
Parts of the Great Basin and vicinity could see highs at least 10F
above normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 PM CST Sat Feb 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Portions of the Southeast...
An upper-level trough and attendant cold front are forecast to move
through the Southeast early D2/Sunday. Behind the front, a drier
airmass with RH of 30-35% is forecast to develop from the Carolinas
into southern GA and the FL panhandle. Bolstered by the strong winds
aloft and the frontal passage, northwesterly surface flow of 10-15
mph is expected through the early afternoon. While hi-res ensemble
guidance is relatively limited in the extent of the fire weather
threat, the most aggressive members do show a few hours of overlap
between the lower humidity, gusty winds and drying fuels. This may
support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with no changes. See
the prior discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 02/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CST Sat Feb 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist for parts of coastal southern
California, but weak winds over the central CONUS will limit fire
weather potential despite dry conditions.

...Southern California...
Although the regional pressure gradient will slacken over the next
36-48 hours, offshore flow will likely persist into Sunday. The
LAX-DAG gradient is expected to linger between -2 to -5 mb, which
should support wind gusts between 20-30 mph within the higher
terrain. With no onshore flow expected through the period, relative
humidities will remain depressed between 15-20% in the lee of higher
terrain. This will support another day of elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions. The fire weather potential will be
more prevalent for areas that have seen several days of downslope
flow and drying of fine fuels, but higher live fuel moisture across
the broader area will limit a more robust threat.

...Central to Southern Plains...
Surface high pressure over the Plains will gradually give way to lee
troughing through the day. This will result in generally weak winds
near 15 mph, but a few areas may see winds increase to near 20 mph.
Furthermore, little to no moisture return into the region will yield
widespread RH values in the 25-35% range. A few locations may see
periods of elevated conditions where reduced RH and breezy winds can
overlap. Ensemble guidance hints that this is most likely across
eastern WY in the lee of the Rockies, but notable spread limits
confidence in the fire weather potential.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 12 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Light snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into Southern New
England...

...Light snow for the Upper Midwest and lake effect snow downwind
from the Great Lakes...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees below average over the
Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, the Tennessee Valley, and
Western/Central Gulf Coast; Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees
above average for parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast...

A front extending from the Northeast Coast to the Central Gulf
Coast will move eastward off most of the East Coast by Sunday
morning. The system will produce showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the Western/Central Gulf Coast on Saturday evening.
Overnight Saturday, upper-level energy will aid in creating light
snow from the northern Mid-Atlantic to parts of New England and
light rain over parts of the southern Mid-Atlantic through late
Sunday night/early Monday morning.

In the front's wake, temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees below
average over the Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic/Northeast, the
Tennessee Valley, and Western/Central Gulf Coast for Sunday. In
contrast, ahead of the front, the temperatures will be 10 to 15
degrees above average for parts of the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on
Sunday morning. In addition, lake effect snow will develop
downwind from the Great Lakes through Sunday evening.
Additionally, over Southern California, temperatures will be in
the low 90s for Sunday, which has prompted Heat Advisories.

Meanwhile, a wave of low pressure moving southeastward across the
Northern/Central Plains will move to South Carolina by Sunday
evening. The system will produce light snow over parts of the
Upper Midwest on Saturday evening, moving into the Middle
Mississippi Valley by Sunday morning. The associated upper-level
energy will produce light snow over parts of the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley for Sunday evening. Snow showers will move into the
Northern/Central Appalachians by Monday morning.
Furthermore, on Sunday evening, another wave of low pressure will
move over parts of the Upper Midwest, moving southeastward to the
Middle Mississippi Valley by Monday morning before moving
northeastward to Eastern Ontario, Canada, by Monday evening. The
fast-moving system will produce light snow over parts of the Upper
Midwest on Sunday afternoon and into parts of the Upper Great
Lakes and Western Ohio Valley by Monday evening.

Moreover, a front will move onshore over parts of the Pacific
Northwest on early Monday morning, moving to the Northern
Rockies/Great Basin by Monday evening. The storm will produce
coastal rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest,
with snow expanding into the Northern Rockies by Monday evening.

...Light snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic into southern New

...Light snow for the Upper Midwest and lake-effect snow downwind
from the Great Lakes...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees below average over the
Great Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, the Tennessee Valley, and
Western/Central Gulf Coast...

...Record-setting heat and a concern for wildfire activity
continues for parts of California...

A front extending from the Northeast Coast to the Central Gulf
Coast will move eastward off most of the East Coast by Sunday
morning. This front will produce showers and thunderstorms over
parts of the Western/Central Gulf Coast this evening. However, as
upper-level energy interacts with the front overnight, there will
be a weak wave of low pressure developing along it over the
Southeast that will result in a developing swath of light snow
from the northern Mid-Atlantic to southern New England Sunday
morning. Locally a few inches of accumulation are expected before
the system quickly exits offshore of the East Coast by midday.
Much colder air temperatures will be arriving, and temperatures
will be as much as 15 to 20 degrees below average over the Great
Lakes, Mid-Atlantic, Northeast, the Tennessee Valley, and
Western/Central Gulf Coast on Sunday. The colder air filtering
over the Great Lakes region will also be responsible for some
accumulating lake-effect snowfall.

Elsewhere, a weak wave of low pressure moving southeastward across
the Northern Plains will move to South Carolina by Sunday evening.
The system will produce light snow over parts of the Upper Midwest
this evening, and into the Middle Mississippi Valley by Sunday
morning. Upper-level energy associated with this will produce
light snow over parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley by Sunday
evening and the Central Appalachians Sunday night. By late Sunday,
there will also be another wave of low pressure moving over parts
of the Upper Midwest, which will move southeastward to the Middle
Mississippi Valley Monday morning before moving northeastward to
eastern Ontario by Monday evening. Some light snow will also be
produced by this system over the Upper Midwest and Upper Great
Lakes late Sunday into Monday.

Meanwhile, across the West, a ridge of high pressure continues to
persist overhead which is bringing widespread above average
temperatures and very dry weather. This will maintain
record-breaking warmth to areas of California to round out the
weekend. Highs on Sunday should reach well into the 70s and 80s
and will have the potential to break several daily records. For
parts of southern California and the interior deserts of the
Southwest, it will be hot with some areas likely reaching the low
90s. Heat advisories are in effect here through Sunday evening as
a result. This heat combined with low relative humidity and gusty
winds will also maintain an elevated threat of wildfire activity
across the region. This latest stretch of abnormally warm weather
is forecast to finally diminish by Monday as an approaching cold
front enters the Pacific Northwest. This front will bring rain and
higher elevation snowfall to the Pacific Northwest, northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies by late Monday.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to eastern U.S. and wintry
weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be an upper
trough/low likely centered near the Four Corners early Wednesday,
which will track eastward and phase with a Plains/east-central
U.S. mean trough. This evolution aloft will lead to surface
cyclogenesis and strong frontal systems in the central U.S.,
drawing moisture northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing
notable precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday and
Thursday. Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while
snow and wintry weather are likely on the northern and western
side of the precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains
and through the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.  By
Friday-Saturday expect a weaker clipper system tracking near the
Canadian border to bring a cold front into the northern tier while
a steadily weakening (but initially quite strong) eastern Pacific
upper ridge drifts toward the West Coast, before additional
troughing enters the Pacific Northwest by Sunday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance continues to show fairly good agreement with the
overall pattern described above, but with detail differences that
could be impactful to the sensible weather. The bulk of guidance
still shows evidence to maintain the closed low within the western
U.S. trough to start the period early Wednesday, then quickly join
with northern stream troughing in the central U.S. by Thursday.
Over the past day or so, guidance has trended toward a somewhat
weaker and faster surface system from the Plains through Midwest
and Great Lakes. Low pressure does eventually strengthen farther
northeastward as northern stream dynamics increasingly influence
the system. The 12Z CMC continued its position southwest of other
solutions with the western upper system and then shear it out more
dramatically farther east, resulting in a weaker surface pattern.
The newer 00Z CMC is in somewhat better alignment with its upper
level pattern but its surface low may be displaced south of a
preferred position. An average of GFS/ECMWF/UKMET runs from the
12Z/18Z cycles once again served to reflect these model trends
toward a slightly faster front and initially weaker low but also
maintain a measure of continuity from the previous forecast.
Beyond the early period detail differences, the combination of
upstream energy diving into/through the West from Wednesday onward
and northern stream troughing that reaches the Plains/Mississippi
Valley still contribute to some of the uncertainty in forecasts of
this system over the course of the period. Lingering southern tier
shortwave energy, with fairly low predictability for specifics,
may have an effect on frontal waviness and precipitation toward
the end of the period.

Elsewhere, continuity is fairly good in principle for the system
forecast to track near the Canadian border/Upper Great Lakes
around Friday-Saturday while typical differences exist for precise
timing of the trailing front. Models vary for a weak and
small-scale shortwave rounding the Pacific upper ridge and then
dropping into the West by late in the week, with GFS runs
strongest and ECMWF runs weakest with this feature, and confidence
remains minimal with the specifics. However there is decent
agreement on an upstream shortwave/cold front approaching the
Pacific Northwest over the weekend.

Preferences for the system over the West and continuing eastward
favored starting the forecast with the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF
and UKMET for about the first half of the period. Then the blend
incorporated some of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by the weekend
given decreasing confidence in some details.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms will become widespread over the central
U.S. on Wednesday into Thursday as surface low pressure
consolidates in the High Plains and advects substantial moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Plains,
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and eventually the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms are possible,
with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe
threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi
and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and Thursday.
There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy rainfall
occurs, possibly in similar regions and spreading toward much of
the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Thursday night. Current
forecasts show the Southern Appalachians could see particularly
high rainfall totals given terrain enhancement there. Continue to
monitor forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats
become better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in
the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The
best potential for meaningful accumulations currently extends from
central parts of the Plains and Midwest/Middle Mississippi Valley
into the Great Lakes region and interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain. Totals/location of any snow will be
very sensitive to precise strength and track of the system given
that wintry weather could be within a fairly narrow band, and a
faster forecast low/front track may temper snowfall amounts. Gusty
winds are possible with the system as well, and at this point
appear most likely near the Northeast coast on Thursday night in
strong southerly flow ahead of the quickly strengthening surface
low.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system. By Friday or Saturday the system along the Canadian
border may bring some snow into the Upper Great Lakes while light
precipitation may reach the northern Pacific Northwest/Rockies by
Friday, which could increase in amounts by Saturday. Some moisture
may linger over the far Southeast/Florida but with low confidence
in coverage and intensity of rainfall at this time.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward ahead of the trough/frontal
system and cooler temperatures spread behind the cold front. Highs
of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F above normal will be
shunted from the southern half of the Plains into the Mississippi
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys Wednesday into the Eastern Seaboard on
Thursday. Daily records could be set for some locations,
especially for warm lows in the East on Thursday, while a few
record high maxima could be challenged as well. On the backside of
the front, temperatures should flip to near or below average,
shown in the Great Basin/Rockies and north-central U.S. on
Wednesday and Thursday before tracking into the eastern third of
the country for the latter part of the week while moderating. Best
potential for temperatures 10-20F below average will be over the
southern half of the Rockies/High Plains and Upper Midwest into
the Great Lakes. An increasing portion of the West and eventually
the Plains should warm up to above average once again by the end
of the week. Parts of the Great Basin and vicinity could see highs
at least 10F above normal, while central parts of the Plains could
even reach 20F above average with temperatures in the 60s by
Sunday.

Beyond the early period detail differences, the combination of
upstream energy diving into/through the West from Wednesday onward
and northern stream troughing that reaches the Plains/Mississippi
Valley still contribute to some of the uncertainty in forecasts of
this system over the course of the period. Lingering southern tier
shortwave energy, with fairly low predictability for specifics,
may have an effect on frontal waviness and precipitation toward
the end of the period.

Elsewhere, continuity is fairly good in principle for the system
forecast to track near the Canadian border/Upper Great Lakes
around Friday-Saturday while typical differences exist for precise
timing of the trailing front. Models vary for a weak and
small-scale shortwave rounding the Pacific upper ridge and then
dropping into the West by late in the week, with GFS runs
strongest and ECMWF runs weakest with this feature, and confidence
remains minimal with the specifics. However there is decent
agreement on an upstream shortwave/cold front approaching the
Pacific Northwest over the weekend.

Preferences for the system over the West and continuing eastward
favored starting the forecast with the 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z ECMWF
and UKMET for about the first half of the period. Then the blend
incorporated some of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by the weekend
given decreasing confidence in some details.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms will become widespread over the central
U.S. on Wednesday into Thursday as surface low pressure
consolidates in the High Plains and advects substantial moisture
from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Plains,
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and eventually the
Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms are possible,
with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing some severe
threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi
and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and Thursday.
There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy rainfall
occurs, possibly in similar regions and spreading toward much of
the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday and Thursday night. Current
forecasts show the Southern Appalachians could see particularly
high rainfall totals given terrain enhancement there. Continue to
monitor forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats
become better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in
the colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The
best potential for meaningful accumulations currently extends from
central parts of the Plains and Midwest/Middle Mississippi Valley
into the Great Lakes region and interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain. Totals/location of any snow will be
very sensitive to precise strength and track of the system given
that wintry weather could be within a fairly narrow band, and a
faster forecast low/front track may temper snowfall amounts. Gusty
winds are possible with the system as well, and at this point
appear most likely near the Northeast coast on Thursday night in
strong southerly flow ahead of the quickly strengthening surface
low.

Dry conditions should prevail over much of the lower 48 behind
this system. By Friday or Saturday the system along the Canadian
border may bring some snow into the Upper Great Lakes while light
precipitation may reach the northern Pacific Northwest/Rockies by
Friday, which could increase in amounts by Saturday. Some moisture
may linger over the far Southeast/Florida but with low confidence
in coverage and intensity of rainfall at this time.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward ahead of the trough/frontal
system and cooler temperatures spread behind the cold front. Highs
of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F above normal will be
shunted from the southern half of the Plains into the Mississippi
and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys Wednesday into the Eastern Seaboard on
Thursday. Daily records could be set for some locations,
especially for warm lows in the East on Thursday, while a few
record high maxima could be challenged as well. On the backside of
the front, temperatures should flip to near or below average,
shown in the Great Basin/Rockies and north-central U.S. on
Wednesday and Thursday before tracking into the eastern third of
the country for the latter part of the week while moderating. Best
potential for temperatures 10-20F below average will be over the
southern half of the Rockies/High Plains and Upper Midwest into
the Great Lakes. An increasing portion of the West and eventually
the Plains should warm up to above average once again by the end
of the week. Parts of the Great Basin and vicinity could see highs
at least 10F above normal, while central parts of the Plains could
even reach 20F above average with temperatures in the 60s by
Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 AM CST Sun Feb 13 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will linger across portions of coastal
southern California, and will likely develop across parts of the
central Plains. Elevated conditions are possible across parts of the
Southeast, but modest fuels will limit the overall threat.
Elsewhere, cool conditions and recent precipitation will mitigate
additional fire weather concerns.

...Southern California...
Winds across the higher terrain of coastal southern CA have been
diminishing over the past 12-24 hours, and this trend is expected to
continue for today as the regional pressure gradient weakens.
However, wind gusts into the 20-30 mph range are being reported this
morning and will likely continue into the early afternoon -
especially for wind prone locations along the southern CA coast. As
winds become more easterly through mid day, stronger downslope winds
will primarily become focused across Orange and San Diego counties.
Persistent downslope flow and record warm temperatures over the past
few days has maintained low RH in the teens/low 20s and helped dry
fine fuels. Despite the slowly diminishing winds, areas of elevated
conditions appear likely for the first half of the day.

...Central High Plains...
Lee troughing is forecast to persist through the day along the
northern to central High Plains. Winds are forecast to increase into
the 15-25 mph range, and gusts up to 30-40 mph are possible. Morning
dewpoint observations show a pocket of drier conditions across
central WY, and this air mass will likely shift into the central
High Plains this afternoon. RH reductions into the low 20s are
possible given the downslope trajectories, and fuels across much of
this region are unseasonably dry outside of areas with recent
snowfall. As such, fire weather conditions appear probable for at
least a few hours this afternoon.

...Southeast...
Dry post-frontal winds are expected to increase to around 15 mph
this afternoon across southeast AL into central GA. Mostly clear
skies and modest boundary-layer mixing should allow RH values to
fall into the 25-35% range for a few hours this afternoon. While
elevated fire weather conditions are possible, recent 10 and
100-hour fuel moisture analyses suggest fuels are not overly
supportive of fire spread, which precludes a risk highlight.

...Light snowfall to impact parts of the Mid-Atlantic and southern
New England today...

...Light snow enters Upper Midwest this evening as lake-effect
snow showers continue downwind from the Great Lakes...

...Above average and record-breaking temperatures likely
throughout California before cooler air arrives by Tuesday...

...Unsettled weather to enter the Northwest and Northern Rockies
by the beginning of the workweek...

Following the passage of a strong cold front, a strengthening
upper-level jet streak over the Northeast has led to an area of
light-to-moderate snow that extends from the central Appalachians
to the Northeast this morning. With temperatures starting near or
above freezing, most locations will initially experience snow only
accumulating to grassy and elevated surfaces. However, areas
slightly higher in elevation northwest of the I-95 corridor will
have the greatest potential for slick roadways into the late
morning hours. Snowfall totals are generally expected to remain
under 4 inches, with locally higher totals possible in the
Shenandoah region of Virginia. As an area of low pressure begins
to strengthen off the East Coast today, it will slowly draw the
band of snow eastward and eventually exit the region early Sunday
night. Portions of southern New England, more specifically Cape
Cod and eastern Massachusetts, could see snow linger into Sunday
night. This will also allow for slightly higher snowfall amounts
and the potential for totals to near 6 inches.

Elsewhere, a few weak and moisture-starved areas of low pressure
are forecast to swing across the Midwest over the next couple of
days. The first system is set to move from the Central Plains into
the Mid-Mississippi Valley today, with a swath of light snow
possible to the north from central Illinois to southern Indiana.
The next area of low pressure is expected to enter North Dakota by
tonight and spread light snow throughout the Upper Midwest into
early Monday. Snowfall totals from these two systems are
anticipated to remain under 2 inches, with the greatest amounts
most likely found throughout northern Minnesota and northeast
North Dakota. Simultaneously, continues cold air advection over
the Great Lakes will lead to scattered lake effect snow showers
over the region. Locally heavier snow is possible downwind of Lake
Michigan, with amounts potentially exceeding 4 inches throughout
far southwest Michigan.

The frigid airmass located over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes this
morning is expected to moderate by Monday, while below average
temperatures expand across much of the eastern United States
through the beginning of the week. Wind Chill Advisories remain in
effect across parts of the Dakotas and northern Minnesota, where
wind chills could drop as low as 30 below zero. Farther west, an
early taste of spring continues for much of California as highs
soar into the 70s and 80s. High temperatures into the low 90s are
possible for southern California, which has prompted Heat
Advisories to remain in effect. These warm temperatures will also
have the potential to break several daily record highs.
Additionally, the combination of low relative humidity and gusty
winds may also lead to elevated fire weather in this region. The
persistent upper-level ridge responsible for the record-breaking
warmth is finally forecast to break down on Valentine's Day as a
strong storm system enters the Pacific Northwest. Coastal/lower
elevation rain showers and mountain snow is likely to spread over
the Northwest, Northern Great Basin, and Northern Rockies through
Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CST Sun Feb 13 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Increasing zonal flow across the northern Rockies will augment a lee
trough draped along the northern to central High Plains. As a
result, southerly winds will increase through the Plains and advect
warmer temperatures northward. Regional elevated fire weather
concerns may develop in the lee of the central Rockies as well as
across parts of the southern Plains, but will remain low across the
rest of the CONUS.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Westerly downslope winds are expected again Monday afternoon on the
western periphery of the surface trough. Winds will likely be weaker
Monday afternoon as compared to Sunday, but should be sustained
between 15-20 mph for many locations. The weaker downslope flow will
also limit the potential for widespread RH reductions into the
20-25% range. A few locations may see elevated fire weather
conditions, but this threat appears too spatially limited for
highlights at this time.

...Southern Plains...
Despite increasing southerly flow across TX and OK, moisture return
will be limited into the southern Plains thanks to the recent
frontal intrusion into the northwestern Gulf. This will maintain dry
conditions for Monday afternoon, and RH values may fall into the low
to mid 20s. With stronger surface pressure falls/mass response
displaced to the north, winds will generally be between 10-15 mph
for much of the day. This may support patchy elevated fire weather
conditions from central TX to far southern OK - especially where
winds can occasionally gust up to 20 mph.

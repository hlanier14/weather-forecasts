Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1022 AM CST Thu Mar 03 2022

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

High-end Elevated conditions are still expected across parts of the
southern High Plains, where single-digit RH have already been
observed and where fuels are approaching record-dry status. Surface
westerly winds may approach the 10-15 mph range by afternoon peak
heating, promoting favorable conditions for wildfire spread. The
previous forecast (see below) for the rest of the CONUS remains on
track, with no changes made.

..Squitieri.. 03/03/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Thu Mar 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will gradually breakdown across the
Intermountain West, as increasing cyclonic flow overspreads the
western CONUS ahead of an approaching large-scale trough. Farther
east, a belt of strong flow aloft within the base of a midlevel
trough will move eastward across the northeastern states. At the
surface, lee troughing and a weak surface low will develop over
portions of the High Plains, while a cold front moves eastward off
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast.

...Southern High Plains...
In response to the lee troughing and weak surface low development
over southeastern CO, southerly surface winds will strengthen
across the southern High Plains during the afternoon. Here, a very
dry antecedent airmass is in place, with current surface
observations (as of 12AM CT) showing RH in the lower teens to lower
20s. During the afternoon hours, RH will fall into the 5-15 percent
range amid 15-20 mph sustained southerly surface winds. This will
result in widespread high-end elevated conditions, exacerbated by
very dry fuels. Spotty critical conditions are also expected across
portions of southeastern CO and far northeastern NM, however,
confidence in any more that spotty critical conditions is too
limited for Critical highlights.

...Southwest...
Ahead of the approaching large-scale trough, breezy southerly
surface winds will overlap critically low RH during the afternoon
and early evening, though these conditions appear too marginal for
this area to introduce highlights at this time.

...Mid-Atlantic and Southeast...
A dry post-frontal airmass will be in place across the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast, where minimum RH of 20-30 percent will develop during
the afternoon. Across the Southeast, sustained westerly surface
winds of 10 mph or less should generally temper the fire-weather
threat. For the Mid-Atlantic, sustained northwesterly surface winds
of 10-15 mph could overlap 25-30 percent RH over parts of NJ, MD,
and DE. With that said, the localized nature of these conditions
casts uncertainty on the fire-weather threat -- precluding Elevated
highlights at this time.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Critical conditions are still expected across eastern New Mexico
into far southwestern Kansas tomorrow/Friday afternoon. By afternoon
peak heating, RH is expected to drop to 15 percent across several
locales amid widespread 20-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds. While RH is still expected to be locally higher across
portions of southeast Colorado into southwestern Kansas, 20+ mph
sustained winds atop record dry fuels warrants the maintenance of
Critical highlights. Critical highlights have also been withheld in
western/central New Mexico (along and west of the Rockies) since
fuels appear relatively less receptive to wildfire spread.
Nonetheless, fuels are dry enough given 15 percent RH and 20 mph
surface wind speeds tomorrow afternoon to warrant Elevated
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/03/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Thu Mar 03 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale midlevel trough will move eastward across the
Southwest, with accompanying strong/deep southwesterly flow
overspreading parts of the Southwest, southern Rockies, and adjacent
High Plains. At the surface, low pressure will gradually deepen over
parts of eastern Colorado, with a dryline extending southward from
the surface low into the TX Trans Pecos region.

...Southern High Plains and Southwest...
Behind the quasi-stationary dryline, widespread RH reductions of
15-20 percent are expected, where a swath of strong sustained
southwesterly surface winds of 20-25 mph will develop. As the
boundary layer diurnally deepens during the afternoon, 30-40 mph
winds in the 1-3 km layer may mix down to the surface across the
Critical area. While there is some uncertainty regarding minimum RH
reductions reaching 15 percent across the northern portion of the
Critical area owing to increased cloud coverage, very strong winds
across the area combined with very dry fuels should compensate for
the somewhat marginal RH.

...Southeast...
A dry airmass will remain in place across the southeastern states,
though generally light surface winds should mitigate the
fire-weather threat. One exception may be over the western portion
of the Florida Peninsula, where breezy easterly surface winds may
coincide with near-critical RH during the afternoon hours. High
uncertainty regarding the overlap of the breezy surface winds and
low RH precludes the introduction of highlights at this time, though
trends will be monitored closely.

...Heavy rain potential across the Mid-Mississippi Valley into
Ohio Valley Sunday into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a shortwave and
surface low pressure system over the Great Lakes, bringing
lingering snow there, but more significantly a chance for heavy to
excessive rainfall along its associated cold front, spreading from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley for the early part
of the week. Farther west, persistent troughing will be in place
in between a ridge in the East Pacific and a subtropical high
initially in the Gulf of Mexico. Broad troughing should spread
eastward across the lower 48 as the week progresses as the
subtropical high gets pushed south into the Caribbean Sea.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance begins the medium range period in rather
good agreement for the large scale pattern and even with placement
of initial shortwaves, including the impactful one in the Great
Lakes and a likely closed low in the Four Corners embedded in the
West trough. At the surface, good consensus exists that the
surface low in the Great Lakes Sunday morning will track quickly
northeastward, while a secondary low forms along the trailing cold
front by Monday. There have been more model variations with the
placement of this wave within an elongated area of low pressure,
but models seem to be coming to a consensus over the Ohio Valley
Monday morning, though GFS runs have been farther southwest, but
perhaps is indicating two lows especially in the new 12Z run.
There is also some spread with that feature's track northeastward
Tuesday, which is dependent on low predictability shortwaves
aloft, as the southern stream low that was closed Sunday morning
lifts northeastward, opens up, and interacts with northern stream
flow. No particular outliers were seen in the 00Z/06Z cycle with
this, but confidence is not high either.

Farther west, energy diving south into the U.S. Sunday-Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
The EC and especially the CMC have shown a slower movement of the
energy (which it shows as a closed low) eastward out of the Four
Corners late Tuesday into Wednesday compared to the GFS suite
through 06Z. Given typical model biases, leaned a bit more toward
the slower solution, and fortunately the 12Z GFS indicates a
slower solution much like the 00Z ECMWF
with the shortwave in the southern half of the Plains early
Wednesday. However, the new 12Z ECMWF trended a bit faster, but
hopefully the run to run swings are lessening. Additional energy
is likely to come through the Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, but
overall confidence in the details of northern stream flow there
and timing and placement of clipper systems in the East is medium
to low.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 00Z/06Z deterministic
guidance favoring the ECMWF and GFS given good agreement early in
the period. Phased in the ensemble means for the middle to later
part of the period with the increasing model differences, favoring
the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic models. This led to good
continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the central/eastern U.S. early next
week. Severe weather is possible from southeastern portions of the
Plains into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Sunday into
Sunday night per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Meanwhile the axis of the heaviest rain is forecast from
southeastern Oklahoma into northern Arkansas/Missouri and the Ohio
Valley, spreading into the Central Appalachians/northern
Mid-Atlantic by Monday. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and . A swath of wintry
precipitation could develop on the north side, with light to
moderate amounts possible from the central Plains/Mid-Mississippi
Valley into the Great Lakes and interior Northeast late Sunday
into Tuesday. Then by the middle of next week, Gulf moisture could
return to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, but
uncertainty remains with the amounts of rainfall onshore,
depending on where a front and low stall.

In the West, snow is likely in higher elevations of the Central
Rockies in particular on Sunday. Then after a quick break in
precipitation, snow chances (with some rain possible in lower
elevations) will increase again by Tuesday and beyond for the
Pacific Northwest and especially across the Northern Rockies,
eventually into the Central Rockies as well. There is more
uncertainty for the potential for snow in the Northern Plains with
this system at this point.

Temperatures will be quite mild for the south-central to eastern
part of the U.S. early in the week ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures could be set.
Temperatures should moderate to near normal after the frontal
passage. The West and parts of the central U.S. will generally be
cooler than average underneath persistent troughing. Particularly
cool spots will be the central High Plains Sunday and Monday, with
highs 15 to 25 degrees below normal, and across the northern High
Plains Wednesday and spreading south and east Thursday.

northern stream flow. No particular outliers were seen in the
00Z/06Z cycle with this, but confidence is not high either.

Farther west, energy diving south into the U.S. Sunday-Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
The EC and especially the CMC have shown a slower movement of the
energy (which it shows as a closed low) eastward out of the Four
Corners late Tuesday into Wednesday compared to the GFS suite
through the 06Z run. Given typical model biases, leaned a bit more
toward the slower solution, and fortunately the 12Z GFS indicates
a slower solution much like the 00Z ECMWF with the shortwave in
the southern half of the Plains early Wednesday. However, the new
12Z ECMWF trended a bit faster, but hopefully the run to run
swings are lessening. Additional energy is likely to come through
the Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, but overall confidence in the
details of northern stream flow there and timing and placement of
clipper systems in the East is medium to low.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 00Z/06Z deterministic
guidance favoring the ECMWF and GFS given good agreement early in
the period. Phased in the ensemble means for the middle to later
part of the period with the increasing model differences, favoring
the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic models. This led to good
continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the central/eastern U.S. early next
week. Severe weather is possible from southeastern portions of the
Plains into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Sunday into
Sunday night per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Meanwhile the axis of the heaviest rain is forecast from
southeastern Oklahoma into northern Arkansas/Missouri and the Ohio
Valley, spreading into the Central Appalachians/northern
Mid-Atlantic by Monday. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall are in place for days 4 and 5. A swath
of wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with
light to moderate amounts possible from the central
Plains/Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast late Sunday into Tuesday. Then by the middle of next
week, Gulf moisture could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley
and Southeast, but uncertainty remains with the amounts of
rainfall onshore, depending on where a front and low stall.

In the West, snow is likely in higher elevations of the Central
Rockies in particular on Sunday. Then after a quick break in
precipitation, snow chances (with some rain possible in lower
elevations) will increase again by Tuesday and beyond for the
Pacific Northwest and especially across the Northern Rockies,
eventually into the Central Rockies as well. There is more
uncertainty for the potential for snow in the Northern Plains with
this system at this point.

Temperatures will be quite mild for the south-central to eastern
part of the U.S. early in the week ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures could be set.
Temperatures should moderate to near normal after the frontal
passage. The West and parts of the central U.S. will generally be
cooler than average underneath persistent troughing. Particularly
cool spots will be the central High Plains Sunday and Monday, with
highs 15 to 25 degrees below normal, and across the northern High
Plains Wednesday and spreading south and east Thursday.

Extended Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Sun Mar 06 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 10 2022

...Heavy rain potential across the Mid-Mississippi Valley into
Ohio Valley Sunday into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a shortwave and
surface low pressure system over the Great Lakes, bringing
lingering snow there, but more significantly a chance for heavy to
excessive rainfall along its associated cold front, spreading from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley for the early part
of the week. Farther west, persistent troughing will be in place
in between a ridge in the East Pacific and a subtropical high
initially in the Gulf of Mexico. Broad troughing should spread
eastward across the lower 48 as the week progresses as the
subtropical high gets pushed south into the Caribbean Sea.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance begins the medium range period in rather
good agreement for the large scale pattern and even with placement
of initial shortwaves, including the impactful one in the Great
Lakes and a likely closed low in the Four Corners embedded in the
West trough. At the surface, good consensus exists that the
surface low in the Great Lakes Sunday morning will track quickly
northeastward, while a secondary low forms along the trailing cold
front by Monday. There have been more model variations with the
placement of this latter wave within an elongated area of low
pressure, but models seem to be coming to a consensus over the
Ohio Valley Monday morning, though GFS runs have been farther
southwest, but perhaps is indicating two lows especially in the
new 12Z run. There is also some spread with that feature's track
northeastward Tuesday, which is dependent on low predictability
shortwaves aloft, as the southern stream low that was closed
Sunday morning lifts northeastward, opens up, and interacts with
northern stream flow. No particular outliers were seen in the
00Z/06Z cycle with this, but confidence is not high either.

Farther west, energy diving south into the U.S. Sunday-Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
The EC and especially the CMC have shown a slower movement of the
energy (which it shows as a closed low) eastward out of the Four
Corners late Tuesday into Wednesday compared to the GFS suite
through the 06Z run. Given typical model biases, leaned a bit more
toward the slower solution, and fortunately the 12Z GFS indicates
a slower solution much like the 00Z ECMWF with the shortwave in
the southern half of the Plains early Wednesday. However, the new
12Z ECMWF trended a bit faster, but hopefully the run to run
swings are lessening. Additional energy is likely to come through
the Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, but overall confidence in the
details of northern stream flow there and timing and placement of
clipper systems in the East is medium to low.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 00Z/06Z deterministic
guidance favoring the ECMWF and GFS given good agreement early in
the period. Phased in the ensemble means for the middle to later
part of the period with the increasing model differences, favoring
the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic models. This led to good
continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the central/eastern U.S. early next
week. Severe weather is possible from southeastern portions of the
Plains into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Sunday into
Sunday night per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Meanwhile the axis of the heaviest rain is forecast from
southeastern Oklahoma into northern Arkansas/Missouri and the Ohio
Valley, spreading into the Central Appalachians/northern
Mid-Atlantic by Monday. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall are in place for days 4 and 5. A swath
of wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with
light to moderate amounts possible from the central
Plains/Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast late Sunday into Tuesday. Then by the middle of next
week, Gulf moisture could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley
and Southeast, but uncertainty remains with the amounts of
rainfall onshore, depending on where a front and low stall.

In the West, snow is likely in higher elevations of the Central
Rockies in particular on Sunday. Then after a quick break in
precipitation, snow chances (with some rain possible in lower
elevations) will increase again by Tuesday and beyond for the
Pacific Northwest and especially across the Northern Rockies,
eventually into the Central Rockies as well. There is more
uncertainty for the potential for snow in the Northern Plains with
this system at this point.

Temperatures will be quite mild for the south-central to eastern
part of the U.S. early in the week ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures could be set.
Temperatures should moderate to near normal after the frontal
passage. The West and parts of the central U.S. will generally be
cooler than average underneath persistent troughing. Particularly
cool spots will be the central High Plains Sunday and Monday, with
highs 15 to 25 degrees below normal, and across the northern High
Plains Wednesday and spreading south and east Thursday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu March 03 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 09 - 13 2022

A highly amplified 500-hPa trough, initially centered over the west-central
CONUS, is forecast to progress eastward during mid-March. Compared to
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook, the coverage of enhanced pro=
babilities of below normal
temperatures expanded east to the Appalachians. Large probabilities (more t=
han
80 percent) for below normal temperatures are forecast across the Northern =
to
Central Great Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. Arctic high pressure is
forecast to shift south from Canada on day 6 with daily temperature anomali=
es
of -10 to -25 degrees F through the 5-day period. Near normal temperatures =
are
favored for most of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic due to a variable
temperature pattern, while anomalous warmth persists for the coastal Southe=
ast
and much of Florida. Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the
southern Great Plains and Southwest but are expected to moderate by day 10.

A frontal passage during this 5-day period slightly elevates probabilities =
for
above normal precipitation across the eastern CONUS. Near to above normal
precipitation remains favored for the Midwest and Great Lakes as there coul=
d
be
a wave of low pressure along the Arctic front. Shortwave troughs and upslop=
e
surface flow support enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities acro=
ss
the northern to central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. As the 500-hPa
trough
axis shifts eastward, favored dryness is forecast to expand eastward from
California and the Southwest to the southern Great Plains.

Mean 500-hPa ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights favors near to above
normal temperatures for much of Alaska although nearby Arctic high pressure
slightly elevates probabilities for below normal temperatures across the
Alaska
Panhandle. A relatively dry pattern is favored throughout Alaska with
southwestern Alaska and the Aleutians most likely to experience
wetter-than-normal conditions.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement and continuity among model solutions with a high amplitude
pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 11 - 17 2022

Ensemble means are in better agreement today with an eastward shift in the
high
amplitude trough axis, but there remains differences with the evolving ridg=
e
near the West Coast. The ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means continue to brea=
k
down the full-latitude ridge over the Northeast Pacific and Alaska, while t=
he
GEFS maintains it for a longer time. The Canadian ensemble mean is preferre=
d
today given its good continuity and its slightly better 500-hPa height anom=
aly
correlation score during the past 60 days. Despite the model differences
upstream, there is good agreement on an anomalous 500-hPa trough with its a=
xis
extending from Hudson Bay southward to the central CONUS. Negative height
departures of more than -120 meters are predicted across the upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley. This longwave pattern continues to support large probabilities (mor=
e
than 70 percent) of below normal temperatures across the north-central CONU=
S.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures taper off south of the 40th
parallel as a moderating trend is expected later in week-2, especially acro=
ss
the south-central CONUS. Recent model guidance, including the 12Z runs,
continue to feature a faster transition to anomalous cold across the Northe=
ast
and Mid-Atlantic. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across the
Southwest and California based on increasing 500-hPa heights. Above normal
temperatures are favored for the Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

Due to the more eastward placement of the longwave trough axis, model guida=
nce
features a notable drying trend during the past few days across the central
CONUS. A cold frontal passage at the beginning of week-2 favors near to abo=
ve
normal precipitation from the Mississippi River to the East Coast. Shortwav=
e
troughs along upslope flow, especially early in week-2, enhance above norma=
l
precipitation probabilities across the Northern to Central Rockies and
adjacent
High Plains. This favored wetness extends west to the coastal Pacific
Northwest, as onshore flow is expected to increase during week-2. A develop=
ing
500-hPa ridge favors below normal precipitation across much of California a=
nd
the Southwest with an expansion eastward to include the Central to Southern
Great Plains.

Above normal 500-hPa heights favor near to above normal temperatures for
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Arctic high pressure, centered over west=
ern
Canada early in week-2, elevates probabilities for below normal temperature=
s
across the Alaska Panhandle. Near to below normal precipitation is favored
throughout Alaska although there are signs of increasing onshore flow
affecting
the southern Panhandle later in week-2.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model continuity offset by differences among the ensemble means on a 500-hP=
a
ridge near the West Coast.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Heavy rain potential across the Mid-Mississippi Valley into
Ohio Valley Sunday into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with a shortwave and
surface low pressure system over the Great Lakes, bringing
lingering snow there, but more significantly a chance for heavy to
excessive rainfall along its associated cold front, spreading from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley for the early part
of the week. Farther west, persistent troughing will be in place
in between a ridge in the East Pacific and a subtropical high
initially in the Gulf of Mexico. Broad troughing should spread
eastward across the lower 48 as the week progresses as the
subtropical high gets pushed south into the Caribbean Sea.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance begins the medium range period in rather
good agreement for the large scale pattern and even with placement
of initial shortwaves, including the impactful one in the Great
Lakes and a likely closed low in the Four Corners embedded in the
West trough. At the surface, good consensus exists that the
surface low in the Great Lakes Sunday morning will track quickly
northeastward, while a secondary low forms along the trailing cold
front by Monday. There have been more model variations with the
placement of this latter wave within an elongated area of low
pressure, but models seem to be coming to a consensus over the
Ohio Valley Monday morning, though GFS runs have been farther
southwest, but perhaps is indicating two lows especially in the
new 12Z run. There is also some spread with that feature's track
northeastward Tuesday, which is dependent on low predictability
shortwaves aloft, as the southern stream low that was closed
Sunday morning lifts northeastward, opens up, and interacts with
northern stream flow. No particular outliers were seen in the
00Z/06Z cycle with this, but confidence is not high either.

Farther west, energy diving south into the U.S. Sunday-Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
The EC and especially the CMC have shown a slower movement of the
energy (which it shows as a closed low) eastward out of the Four
Corners late Tuesday into Wednesday compared to the GFS suite
through the 06Z run. Given typical model biases, leaned a bit more
toward the slower solution, and fortunately the 12Z GFS indicates
a slower solution much like the 00Z ECMWF with the shortwave in
the southern half of the Plains early Wednesday. However, the new
12Z ECMWF trended a bit faster, but hopefully the run to run
swings are lessening. Additional energy is likely to come through
the Northwest by Wednesday-Thursday, but overall confidence in the
details of northern stream flow there and timing and placement of
clipper systems in the East is medium to low.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 00Z/06Z deterministic
guidance favoring the ECMWF and GFS given good agreement early in
the period. Phased in the ensemble means for the middle to later
part of the period with the increasing model differences, favoring
the ECMWF in terms of the deterministic models. This led to good
continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the central/eastern U.S. early next
week. Severe weather is possible from southeastern portions of the
Plains into the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Sunday into
Sunday night per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Meanwhile the axis of the heaviest rain is forecast from
southeastern Oklahoma into northern Arkansas/Missouri and the Ohio
Valley, spreading into the Central Appalachians/northern
Mid-Atlantic by Monday. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall are in place for days 4 and 5. A swath
of wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with
light to moderate amounts possible from the central
Plains/Mid-Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast late Sunday into Tuesday. Then by the middle of next
week, Gulf moisture could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley
and Southeast, but uncertainty remains with the amounts of
rainfall onshore, depending on where a front and low stall.

In the West, snow is likely in higher elevations of the Central
Rockies in particular on Sunday. Then after a quick break in
precipitation, snow chances (with some rain possible in lower
elevations) will increase again by Tuesday and beyond for the
Pacific Northwest and especially across the Northern Rockies,
eventually into the Central Rockies as well. There is more
uncertainty for the potential for snow in the Northern Plains with
this system at this point.

Temperatures will be quite mild for the south-central to eastern
part of the U.S. early in the week ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures could be set.
Temperatures should moderate to near normal after the frontal
passage. The West and parts of the central U.S. will generally be
cooler than average underneath persistent troughing. Particularly
cool spots will be the central High Plains Sunday and Monday, with
highs 15 to 25 degrees below normal, and across the northern High
Plains Wednesday and spreading south and east Thursday.

...Warm weather continues over the Great Basin to the Southeast,
with fire weather conditions worsening in the Southwest/Plains...

...Cooler temperatures, lower elevation rain, and mountain snow
move into California, the Southwest, and Great Basin tonight...

Fairly quiet weather remains over the Lower 48 this afternoon.
High pressure is nestled over the Northern Plains with a cool
continental airmass overhead the upper half of the CONUS, in
contrast to the widespread warmth of yesterday. However,
Spring-like temperatures will make a quick return over areas north
of the front in the central and eastern U.S. as the cool airmass
moderates and warm southerly flow gets re-established today. By
this weekend, well above average daytime highs in the 70's-80's
should be commonplace from the Mid-Atlantic into the Southern
Plains, which could threaten some daily high temperature records
Friday and Saturday over the Central Plains and Southeast. The
period of warm weather will also support favorable fire weather
conditions over the Plains and Southwest today into this weekend,
where SPC highlights an Elevated (level 1/3) and Critical (level
2/3) risk of fire weather conditions today and tomorrow,
respectively.

Meanwhile, west of the Rockies, a cool Pacific airmass is forecast
to descend south and east over the Great Basin this weekend, in
turn supporting mild high temperatures in the 40's-high 50's
alongside unsettled weather. By Saturday, up to a foot of snow is
possible over mountain peaks in the Sierra, with a rain in the
lower elevations. The unsettled conditions will migrate east
Saturday and snow will pickup intensity across the Rockies before
the associated surface wave deepens and spreads into the Front
Range, Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Snow will remain modest
for the Plains and Upper Midwest, with totals likely to range
between 3-6 inches on Saturday. Parts of northern Wisconsin and
Michigan's Upper Peninsula may experience freezing rain up to a
tenth of an inch during this period so at least some weekend
travel impacts are likely. In the warm sector of the developing
surface low, strong moisture return ahead of an approaching front
and dryline will support showers and thunderstorms over the
Midwest/Central Mississippi Valley, some of which may be severe on
Saturday per SPC. Some localized heavy rainfall totals are
possible with any thunderstorms that form, although no widespread
excessive rainfall threat is expected as of now.

SYNOPSIS: There is better agreement among today's dynamical models in regar=
ds
to the strength and evolution of broad mid-level low pressure centered over
the
central contiguous U.S. (CONUS) throughout week-2. This mid-level low press=
ure
is anticipated to shift eastward with time before transitioning to a less
amplified pattern by the end of the period. This pattern is conducive to
elevated chances of much below normal temperatures across much of the lower=
 48
at the beginning of week-2, shifting eastward with time. There is multi-mod=
el
depiction of frontal activity ahead of the amplified mid-level low pressure
over the central CONUS at the beginning of the period, with surface low
anticipated to develop over the Southern Plains at the beginning of the
period,
tracking northeastward to the Northeast. The anticipated surface low and
associated front may support increased risk for high winds across portions =
of
the Central and Southern Plains followed by the northeastern lower 48.
Additionally, there may be lingering potential for heavy precipitation acro=
ss
the southeastern CONUS associated with frontal activity across the region a=
nd
strong onshore moist flow. Prevailing mid-level high pressure forecast for
much
of the western U.S. and Alaska is favored to bring tranquil conditions duri=
ng
week-2.

HAZARDS

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 11 - THURSDAY MARCH 17: There is increased agreement among
today's ensemble means (0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian) regarding full latitu=
de
coverage of negative height departures extending from Canada to northern
Mexico
initially over the Interior West at the beginning of the period shifting
eastward over time. This translates to better consensus between the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF reforecast indicating broad regions with enhanced risk for much below
normal temperatures shifting eastward during week-2, before a transition to=
 a
weaker mid-level pattern by day 14 (Mar 17). A broad area is highlighted wi=
th
a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the CONUS
excluding the West Coast, Mar 11 to 16, where there is good agreement among
the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 0 Deg F across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest and 40 Deg F across the Deep South. This
risk
is anticipated to shift eastward throughout the identified hazard period. A=
n
embedded moderate risk area (>40% chance) of much below normal temperatures=
 is
expanded to cover much of the Northern and Central Rockies, Great Plains, a=
nd
Mississippi Valley, Mar 11 to 12, and a high risk (>60% chance) is introduc=
ed
across portions of the Great Plains and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley=
,
Mar 11, due to the strengthened cold signal and agreement among model guida=
nce
and tools. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile, compared to the 30-year
climatology.



There is lingering potential for heavy precipitation across the southeaster=
n
CONUS associated with frontal activity in the region and strong onshore flo=
w
from the Gulf of Mexico at the beginning of the period. Recent ECMWF
deterministic and ensemble mean solutions favor much of the heavier
precipitation falling on day 7, prior to the outset of week-2, however the
GFS/GEFS counterparts favor day 8 (Mar 11) for the heaviest amounts. Due to
uncertainty in the timing of this feature, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation
is maintained across portions of the southeastern quadrant, primarily based=
 on
the uncalibrated GEFS ensemble mean and the GEFS reforecast tool, which
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch, with the expectation that much of it would occur o=
n
day 8.



Frontal activity is anticipated ahead of the amplified mid-level trough,
stretching from the Great Lakes to Southern Plains at the beginning of the
period. Surface low is predicted to form over the Southern Plains associate=
d
with this front at the beginning of the period, tracking northeastward to t=
he
Northeast, increasing chances for related hazards. A slight risk of high wi=
nds
is designated initially across parts of the Central and Southern Plains, Ma=
r
11, followed by the eastern Great Lakes region, Northeast, Central
Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic, Mar 12 to 13. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at leas=
t a
20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph over the
Central and Southern Plains, whereas the GEFS reforecast tool does not show
this high wind signal. There is, however, good agreement among recent GFS a=
nd
ECMWF deterministic runs indicating high wind potential, with localized win=
d
speeds possibly exceeding 35 mph. Over the northeastern quadrant of the CON=
US
there is better agreement between the reforecast tools, with both indicatin=
g
at
least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the aforementioned thresholds.
There still exists the increased potential for heavy snow across parts of t=
he
Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes on the backside of =
the
surface low. The experimental GEFS snow reforecast tool indicates at least =
a
20% chance of snow water equivalent (SWE) exceeding the 85th percentile acr=
oss
these areas during the 8 to 10 day period. Due to the ECMWF ensemble and
deterministic solutions favoring lower precipitation totals, a related snow
hazard is not posted at this time.



Further upstream, surface high pressure across the Northern Plains combined
with possible surface low formation across the Northern Rockies may support
localized heavy upslope snow over the Northern and Central Rockies and
Northern
Plains at the beginning of the period. The experimental GEFS snow reforecas=
t
tool indicates at least a 20% chance of accumulated 3-day SWE exceeding the
85th percentile in this region. Due to significant model uncertainty in the
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble tool and deterministic ECMWF, a snow hazard is =
not
posted.



Over Alaska, amplified mid-level ridging forecast over much of the northern
Pacific and the Bering Sea is expected to lead to unseasonably warm
temperatures. No hazards are anticipated for Alaska at this time. However, =
the
persistence of above normal temperatures over Alaska bears monitoring as th=
e
state approaches the river ice breakup season later this spring.

SYNOPSIS: There is better agreement among today's dynamical models in regar=
ds
to the strength and evolution of broad mid-level low pressure centered over
the
central contiguous U.S. (CONUS) throughout week-2. This mid-level low press=
ure
is anticipated to shift eastward with time before transitioning to a less
amplified pattern by the end of the period. This pattern is conducive to
elevated chances of much below normal temperatures across much of the lower=
 48
at the beginning of week-2, shifting eastward with time. There is multi-mod=
el
depiction of frontal activity ahead of the amplified mid-level low pressure
over the central CONUS at the beginning of the period, with surface low
anticipated to develop over the Southern Plains at the beginning of the
period,
tracking northeastward to the Northeast. The anticipated surface low and
associated front may support increased risk for high winds across portions =
of
the Central and Southern Plains followed by the northeastern lower 48.
Additionally, there may be lingering potential for heavy precipitation acro=
ss
the southeastern CONUS associated with frontal activity across the region a=
nd
strong onshore moist flow. Prevailing mid-level high pressure forecast for
much
of the western U.S. and Alaska is favored to bring tranquil conditions duri=
ng
week-2.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Great Plain=
s
and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Fri, Mar 11.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for across much of the
Northern
and Central Rockies, Great Plains, and Mississippi Valley, Fri-Sat, Mar 11-=
12.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures shifting eastward with time
across much of the CONUS excluding the West Coast, Fri-Wed, Mar 11-16.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the southeastern quadran=
t
of
the CONUS, Fri, Mar 11.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Central and Southern Plains,
Fri,
Mar 11.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the eastern Great Lakes region,
Northeast, Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic, Sat-Sun, Mar 12-13.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MARCH 06 - THURSDAY MARCH 10:

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 11 - THURSDAY MARCH 17: There is increased agreement among
today's ensemble means (0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian) regarding full latitu=
de
coverage of negative height departures extending from Canada to northern
Mexico
initially over the Interior West at the beginning of the period shifting
eastward over time. This translates to better consensus between the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF reforecast indicating broad regions with enhanced risk for much below
normal temperatures shifting eastward during week-2, before a transition to=
 a
weaker mid-level pattern by day 14 (Mar 17). A broad area is highlighted wi=
th
a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the CONUS
excluding the West Coast, Mar 11 to 16, where there is good agreement among
the
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 0 Deg F across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest and 40 Deg F across the Deep South. This
risk
is anticipated to shift eastward throughout the identified hazard period. A=
n
embedded moderate risk area (>40% chance) of much below normal temperatures=
 is
expanded to cover much of the Northern and Central Rockies, Great Plains, a=
nd
Mississippi Valley, Mar 11 to 12, and a high risk (>60% chance) is introduc=
ed
across portions of the Great Plains and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley=
,
Mar 11, due to the strengthened cold signal and agreement among model guida=
nce
and tools. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 5th percentile, compared to the 30-year
climatology, across portions of the highlighted moderate risk area.



There is lingering potential for heavy precipitation across the southeaster=
n
CONUS associated with frontal activity in the region and strong onshore flo=
w
from the Gulf of Mexico at the beginning of the period. Recent ECMWF
deterministic and ensemble mean solutions favor much of the heavier
precipitation falling on day 7, prior to the outset of week-2, however the
GFS/GEFS counterparts favor day 8 (Mar 11) for the heaviest amounts. Due to
uncertainty in the timing of this feature, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation
is maintained across portions of the southeastern quadrant, primarily based=
 on
the uncalibrated GEFS ensemble mean and the GEFS reforecast tool, which
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch, with the expectation that much of it would occur o=
n
day 8.



Frontal activity is anticipated ahead of the amplified mid-level trough,

nds
is designated initially across parts of the Central and Southern Plains, Ma=
r
11, followed by the eastern Great Lakes region, Northeast, Central
Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic, Mar 12 to 13. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at leas=
t a
20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph over the
Central and Southern Plains, whereas the GEFS reforecast tool does not show
this high wind signal. There is, however, good agreement among recent GFS a=

There still exists the increased potential for heavy snow across parts of t=
he
Middle Mississippi Valley, Ohio Valley, and Great Lakes on the backside of =
the
surface low. The experimental GEFS snow reforecast tool indicates at least =
a
20% chance of snow water equivalent (SWE) exceeding the 85th percentile acr=
oss
these areas during the 8 to 10 day period. Due to the ECMWF ensemble and
deterministic solutions favoring lower precipitation totals, a related snow
hazard is not posted at this time.



Further upstream, surface high pressure across the Northern Plains combined
with possible surface low formation across the Northern Rockies may support
localized heavy upslope snow over the Northern and Central Rockies and
Northern
Plains at the beginning of the period. The experimental GEFS snow reforecas=
t
tool indicates at least a 20% chance of accumulated 3-day SWE exceeding the
85th percentile in this region. Due to significant model uncertainty in the
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble tool and deterministic ECMWF, a snow hazard is =
not
posted.



Over Alaska, amplified mid-level ridging forecast over much of the northern
Pacific and the Bering Sea is expected to lead to unseasonably warm
temperatures. No hazards are anticipated for Alaska at this time. However, =
the
persistence of above normal temperatures over Alaska bears monitoring as th=
e

...Heavy rain potential across the Ohio Valley into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with broad troughing (with
embedded shortwaves) across the central U.S. pushing a cold front
into the East. This setup brings a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall across the Ohio Valley, with snow to the north.
Shortwaves should weaken in the flow as they progress downstream
as heights begin to rise over the East Coast. Out West, a strong
ridge over the east Pacific should allow for shortwaves to keep
reinforced troughing over the Rockies, which eventually should
press east into the Plains by late next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance continues to show good agreement in the
large scale pattern through much of the period, with mostly
typical timing and detail differences needing to be worked out.
Good consensus exists that a surface wave (or two) will develop
along the cold front over the Ohio Valley on Monday, progressing
into the Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday. There continues to be some
subtle timing differences with this low, which stems from
differences aloft in the shortwave. The CMC and UKMET are a hair
faster than the GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means, but a general blend
of the guidance does offer a good starting point on position.

Farther west, energy diving south along the West Coast on Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
Before the new 00z runs this morning, the CMC appeared to be an
outlier with a slower/more amplified solution closing off a low
over the Southwest on Tuesday and the remainder of the guidance
more open/faster (to varying degrees). However, the new 00z
guidance arriving this morning from the GFS, the ECMWF, and the
UKMET has also trended towards the CMC with a closed low. The WPC
forecast for overnight leaned more on the faster side of the
envelope given the CMC seemed an outlier, but with the new 00z
runs (which were not available at forecast issuance), even the WPC
forecast may now be too fast mid week and beyond with the energy
as it moves into the central Plains. In other words, this remains
a very low confidence forecast.

The next shortwave arrives into the Pacific Northwest around
Wednesday-Thursday which should help to reinforce broad troughing
over the Rockies which eventually pushes into the Central U.S. by
the end of the week. There are some timing differences regarding
both the trough axis and the associated surface front. The 18z/Mar
3 GFS was faster than the ECMWF with the ensemble means also maybe
more in like with the slower ECMWF. The WPC forecast leaned
heavily on the ensemble means for this system given the late
period/low predictability with some inclusion of the deterministic
runs for a little added system definition.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the Eastern U.S. early next week. The
axis of the heaviest rain by Monday is forecast from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall remain in place for day 4. A swath of
wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with light
to moderate amounts possible from into the Great Lakes and
interior Northeast. Then by the middle of next week, Gulf moisture
could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, but
uncertainty remains with respect to rainfall totals, all dependent
on a stalling boundary and possible waves of low pressure.

The West should see a break in the precipitation on Monday, but
mountains snows return by Tuesday and beyond for the Pacific
Northwest and especially the Rockies. There remains some
potential, but low confidence, on snowfall into the northern
Plains/upper Midwest late week as low pressure tries to develop
over the central states.

Temperatures should feel very mild for the south-central to
eastern part of the U.S. on Monday ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures possible.
Temperatures should moderate back to near normal after the frontal
passage on Tuesday. The West and parts of the central U.S. will
generally be cooler than average underneath persistent troughing
through much of the period. Although with more substantial
troughing into the region mid to late next week, temperatures
should trend cooler with anomalies 10 to 30 degrees below normal
possible across the northern and central Plains, and as far south
as Texas and Oklahoma.

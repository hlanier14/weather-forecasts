Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CST Fri Feb 11 2022

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...Central/Southern Appalachians...
Southeast of an intensifying mid-level jet across the Ohio valley,
dry and breezy surface conditions are expected to develop across
much of the central and southern Appalachians, especially through
parts of central and eastern Kentucky. Model soundings show dry and
warm surface conditions will likely support strong vertical mixing
and drying through peak heating. With increasing flow aloft
impinging from the northwest, surface winds of 10-15 mph with
occasional higher gusts appear plausible. As surface RH falls below
35% through the diurnal cycle, a few hours of locally elevated fire
weather conditions are possible within areas of recently drying
fuels across eastern Kentucky. Elsewhere, fuels remain generally
unfavorable for significant fire spread suggesting a limited fire
weather threat. Fire weather concerns will quickly diminish
overnight as a cold front and much cooler airmass arrive from the
north and west.

...Southern California...
Offshore winds are forecast to continue through much of the day
today albeit with a brief pause in intensity. Despite the slight
weakening, very warm and dry conditions will persist, supporting
locally elevated fire weather potential within areas of dead fuels
across coastal southern California. A resurgence in the offshore
flow is forecast to develop late tonight and into D2/Saturday, as
high pressure begins to intensify over the eastern Great Basin.
Coincident with continuing poor overnight humidity recoveries around
20%, the increase in offshore winds may support more sustained fire
weather potential through early D2/Saturday.

...Southern Plains...
Morning observations show drier surface conditions generally lagging
behind the surface front and stronger northerly winds moving across
parts of KS, OK and TX. While clear skies appear likely to support
additional drying over the next few hours, latest hi-res guidance
suggests surface RH below 30% will be limited across much of the
southern Plains. While elevated fire weather conditions still appear
plausible, the lack of drier surface conditions and poor overlap
with the strongest winds should keep any critical conditions local
in nature. See the prior discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 02/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1232 AM CST Fri Feb 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected across parts of the
Plains today as winds increase behind a southward-surging cold
front. Fire weather concerns are also possible for parts of coastal
southern California where temperatures will remain well above
normal.

...Central Plains...
A cold front is noted across central NE in early-morning
observations. Most model solutions place this front through central
OK and into north TX by mid-day with only a modest post-frontal
temperature reduction. However, cold air advection just off the
surface combined with diurnal heating should support downward mixing
of 30-40 mph winds to the surface by mid/late afternoon from
southern NE into northern TX. Sustained winds near 20 mph and 20-30%
RH appear likely, but confidence remains somewhat low on the
propensity for sub-20% across the plains - mainly due to the
potential for low to mid-level clouds. Latest ensemble guidance and
drier solutions hint at the best potential for RH in the teens and
critical fire weather conditions across southwest KS into northwest
OK where cloud cover may be more limited. A Critical risk area may
be needed for this area if RH begins to trend towards the drier
solutions.

...Coastal Southern California...
Despite a weakening in the regional pressure gradient over the past
12 hours, offshore winds continue early Friday with 20-40 mph gusts
noted in the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. RH
values remain in the teens due to persistent downslope flow and
should remain depressed through the day along the southern CA coast.
Although winds will abate slightly, the continued offshore flow
coupled with near record temperatures will support at least a
low-end fire weather concern - especially in drier pockets with
reduced fine fuel moisture.

...Southern Plains into Central Texas...
Behind a fast-moving cold front passing through early in the
forecast period, dry surface conditions are forecast to develop
across portions of the southern Plains and central TX. While
temperatures will likely be cooler, daytime heating and continued
downsloping of an already dry low-level airmass should result in
surface humidity values below 30% for much of the day. Surface winds
are forecast to be strongest near the front as it continues to move
south across central and south TX, but widespread winds of 10-20 mph
appear possible across much of the southern Plains through the first
half of the day. The combination of modestly dry fuels, strong winds
and lower humidity will likely support a few hours of elevated fire
weather potential before winds weaken later in the afternoon and
into the evening. An elevated area has been added across portions of
central TX and southern OK.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow should intensify through the early morning hours
peaking by mid to late morning. Throughout the higher terrain, winds
of 30-50 mph and humidity of 6-12% will support widespread elevated
and critical meteorological conditions. Overall live fuel moisture
remains high casting some uncertainty on the threat. However
elevated highlights will be retained given the favorable
meteorological conditions for fire spread. See the previous
discussion for more information.

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will increase for portions of coastal
southern California Saturday amid strengthening offshore winds.
Elsewhere, low-end fire weather conditions are likely across parts
of southern Texas and the northern High Plains, but the fire weather
threat will be dependent on fuel conditions.

...Southern California...
Short and medium range ensemble guidance is in relatively good
agreement in the strengthening of the regional pressure gradient
across southern CA late Friday into Saturday. Increasing
northeasterly mid-level winds will support wind gusts between 30-50
mph within the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura counties
and possibly southward into the San Diego area. Persistent offshore
flow over the next 48 hours will maintain reduced RH in the teens
and temperatures are forecast to remain near record highs through
the weekend, so elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
appear likely. Fire weather concerns will be maximized in areas that
have seen persistent downslope winds and drier fine fuels.

...Southern Texas...
The cold front that is forecast to push through OK and north TX
Friday will progress through south TX on Saturday. Strong cold
advection behind the front will support wind gusts between 20-40
mph, and modest boundary-layer mixing will help RH fall into the
20-35% range. Confidence in the RH forecast is low due to notable
spread in guidance and low ensemble probabilities, though the best
potential for sustained elevated conditions will most likely be
along and west of I-35 south of San Antonio. Fuel conditions across
southern TX are modestly receptive per latest fuel guidance. ERCs
are currently only slightly above seasonal average and are forecast
to increase to the in the 50-80th percentiles over the weekend. An
Elevated risk area may be needed in subsequent outlooks if fuels
continue to dry and confidence in low RH increases.

...Northern High Plains...
A surface low is expected to deepen over the northern Plains through
the day Saturday as an upper-level wave moves over the region.
Northwest downslope winds off the northern Rockies will support
warming/drying across the northern High Plains from MT into eastern
WY. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph and RH reductions into the
20-30% range are likely. This fire weather concern will be
conditional on fuel status by Saturday. ERCs are generally in the
50-75th percentile and many locations are receiving light snowfall
as of early Friday morning. Trends in fuel status will continue to
be monitored.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain from the
south-central to east-central U.S. and wintry weather from the
Midwest through Great Lakes and interior Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be on a
potent upper low forecast to enter the Pacific Northwest on
Monday. This feature should drop southeastward along the West
Coast early in the workweek, cross the Southwest around late
Tuesday/Wednesday, and become incorporated into a
Plains/east-central U.S. mean trough by the latter half of the
week. This evolution aloft will lead to surface cyclogenesis and
strong frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable
precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into Friday.
Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and
wintry weather are likely on the northern and western side of the
precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

00Z/06Z guidance remains more agreeable and consistent than
average for the days 3-5 Monday-Wednesday part of the forecast.
Consensus shows a strong East Pacific ridge supporting a
southeastward track for the upper low of interest, from the
Pacific Northwest during the day Monday and reaching the Southwest
by late Tuesday-early Wednesday. Meanwhile upper troughing lifts
away from the East and an initial western U.S. ridge broadens as
it continues eastward. A blend of the GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET from
each model's latest available cycle represented the prevailing
themes of the forecast well. New 12Z runs are similar except for
the CMC that strays weaker/slower with the upper system Tuesday
onward, affecting its forecast farther east through the rest of
the week.

Uncertainty and guidance spread/run-to-run variability increase
somewhat during the latter half of the period. Contributors to the
differences include upstream shortwave energy forecast to drop
into and through the West during mid-late week as well as
important specifics of northern stream flow that may interact with
the leading upper low as it ejects beyond the Rockies/Plains.
These issues will affect the timing, strength, and track of low
pressure as it progresses from near the south-central Plains
northeastward after midweek. In recent runs the GFS has tended to
be a bit on the deeper side of the operational model spread (and
within the deeper part of the GEFS envelope) at some valid times
but has been trending weaker since the 00Z run. The CMC has been
on the weaker/sheared side. For early next Thursday the 12Z UKMET
has come in halfway between the 12Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF for depth.
Meanwhile the ECMWF has trended faster over the past couple days
and the new 12Z run is a bit weaker and farther east versus the
00Z run. Transitioning the 00Z/06Z model blend to include some 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input by days 6-7 Thursday-Friday accounted
for the gradual increase of uncertainty and provided good
continuity in principle. The forecast yielded a modestly stronger
system tracking northeast from the Plains, with additional room
for refinement if confidence increases.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper low/trough dropping into the West early in the week will
spread an area of precipitation across the region, but totals of
coastal/lower elevation rain and mountain snow should remain light
to moderate. However, widespread showers and thunderstorms are
likely to develop over the central U.S. by Wednesday into Thursday
as surface low pressure consolidates in the High Plains and
advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Plains, Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and
eventually the Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms could be possible,
with the current days 6-7 Storm Prediction Center outlook showing
some severe threat from parts of the southern Plains into
Tennessee Valley and vicinity. There will also be flash flooding
concerns where heavy rainfall occurs. Continue to monitor
forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats become
better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in the
colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The best
potential for meaningful accumulations currently extends from
central parts of the Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest/Great Lakes region into interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain. Totals/location of any snow will be
very sensitive to precise strength and track of the system. Strong
winds may be possible in the gradient between the surface low and
high pressure to the northwest, and then possibly along parts of
the East Coast within the southerly flow ahead of the storm.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week. Warmer than average
temperatures across the Central Great Basin and Southwest Monday
will moderate to near normal or slightly below Tuesday and
Wednesday underneath the incoming upper trough/low. West Coast
states should see readings rebound to moderately above normal for
the latter half of the week. Meanwhile a warming trend over the
central U.S. should peak around Tuesday-Wednesday as high
temperatures reach 10-20F above normal both days with lows 15-25F
above normal Wednesday. The system/cold front emerging from the
West will then quickly drop temperatures to 5-15F or so below
normal for Thursday-Friday. Meanwhile the midweek warmth over the
Plains will move into the East for Thursday-Friday with one or two
days of highs up to 10-20F above normal and lows exceeding 20F
above normal over some areas. This will represent a significant
warming trend for the Eastern Seaboard which can expect to start
the week with temperatures 10-20F below normal.

During the latter half of week-2 mid-level low pressure is forecast to buil=
d
across the southwestern lower 48, which may lead to high winds over parts o=
f
the Central and Southern High Plains and Four Corners. Over Alaska, the
prevailing mid-level height pattern supports the potential for much
below-normal temperatures across the Southwest Mainland through much of
week-2,
with heavy precipitation, high elevation snow, and high winds possible acro=
ss
the Southeast Mainland and the Panhandle in the first half of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for southwestern Mainland Ala=
ska
and the Alaska Peninsula, Sat-Thu, Feb 19-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of southeastern Mainland
Alaska
and the Panhandle, Sat-Mon, Feb 19-21.

Slight risk of heavy snow for high-elevation areas of southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the Panhandle, Sat-Mon, Feb 19-21.

Slight risk of high winds for the Central and Southern High Plains and
portions
of the Four Corners, Wed-Thu, Feb 23-24.

Slight risk of high winds for coastal areas of southern Mainland Alaska and

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY FEBRUARY 14 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 18:

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 19 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 25: Today's GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian mean 500-hPa height forecasts continue to favor strong mid-level
ridging over the Northeast Pacific, with mean troughing over the west-centr=
al
CONUS tied to a transient short-wave disturbance during the latter half of
week-2. Downstream, surface high pressure is expected to build across the
eastern CONUS in the wake of a strong storm system that will exit the Easte=
rn
Seaboard at the end of week-1, which will likely moderate temperatures acro=
ss
the eastern two-thirds of the lower 48 throughout the period. However, ther=
e
is
increased disagreement among the model guidance with respect to the evoluti=
on
of the long-wave pattern during the latter half of week-2, with the GEFS mo=
del
favoring a more progressive pattern.



A slight risk of high winds is issued for portions of the Central and South=
ern
High Plains and Four Corners region, Feb 23-24, associated with the
development
of surface low pressure over the southwestern CONUS ahead of a mid-level
trough. Additionally, the ECMWF ensemble reforecast tool indicates at least=
 a
20% chance for wind speeds to exceed the 85th percentile and 25 mph for
several
locations, with some areas having at least a 30% chance of exceeding the 85=
th
percentile. However, there is some uncertainty in the timing of this slight
risk of high winds due to the GEFS favoring a more progressive long-wave
pattern than the ECMWF ensemble, with the Canadian ensemble falling somewhe=
re
in between.



Over Alaska, there is some increased disagreement between today=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and
ECMWF ensemble model guidance with respect to the forecast temperature fiel=
ds,
with the ECMWF ensemble favoring weaker anomalous cold signals over much of
the
Mainland throughout week-2. However, both models do indicate generally weak=
er
anomalous cold signals when compared to their respective solutions for
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 outlook. Therefore, the slight=
 risk for much below normal
minimum temperatures is reduced in coverage over Mainland Alaska, relative =
to
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs slight risk area, with the hazardous =
cold forecast to end Feb
24.
Despite the weak signal in the ECMWF reforecast tool, the GEFS reforecast
still
indicates at least a 20% that minimum temperatures will fall below the 15th
percentile through much of the period.



Across southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, increased onshore fl=
ow
ahead of mean surface low pressure is expected to promote above-normal
precipitation over the region during the first three days of the period, Fe=
b
19-21. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools indicate at least =
a
20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile, wit=
h
the potential for some locations to receive in excess of two inches,
supporting
the continuation of the slight risk areas for heavy precipitation and
high-elevation heavy snow across the Alaska Panhandle. Additionally,
reforecast
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile and 40 mph along the immediate coast of the Southeast Mainland a=
nd
Panhandle, warranting the continuation of the slight risk for high winds
during
the 3-day period. However, it should be noted that there is a slight trimmi=
ng
of the northwest extent of the slight risks for heavy precipitation and hea=
vy
snow, as the models have shifted the largest precipitation totals slightly
southward in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs solutions.



Due to antecedent wet conditions in southeastern Alaska, where some locatio=
ns
have experienced more than twice their normal precipitation for the year, t=
he
continuation of above-normal precipitation during week-2 is expected to
adversely affect the highlighted region and raises the concern for landslid=
es
in the lower elevations. The increased risk for high winds may also exacerb=
ate
landslide potential.

...Breezy wind and light snow over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes...

...Light snow for the Central/Southern Rockies...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees below average over the
Great Lakes, parts of the Mississippi Valley, and Southern Plains;
Temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average over most of
the East Coast...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes to the Southern High
Plains will move eastward of the Northeast Coast by Saturday
evening and off the rest of the coast by Sunday. The system will
produce breezy wind and light snow over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes and light rain over parts of
the Ohio Valley for Friday evening. Overnight Friday, snow will
end over the Upper Mississippi Valley and enter the Lower Great
Lakes as light rain moves into parts of the Northeast to the
Central Appalachians. The rain will mainly end by Saturday
afternoon with light snow over parts of the Northeast.

In the front's wake, temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees below
average over the Great Lakes, parts of the Mississippi Valley, and
Southern Plains. In contrast, ahead of the front, the temperatures
along the East Coast will be 10 to 15 degrees above average. In
addition, lake effect snow will develop downwind from the Great
Lakes through Sunday evening.

Meanwhile, upslope flow and upper-level energy will aid in
producing light snow over parts of the Northern High Plains,
moving into the Central/Southern Rockies by Saturday. As the
upper-level energy moves over the Southern Plains, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southern
Plains/Western Gulf Coast on Saturday. Furthermore, a wave of low
pressure moving southeastward out of Western Canada will move
southeastward across the Northern Plains to South Carolina by
Sunday evening. The system will produce light snow over parts of
the Upper Midwest on Saturday evening, moving into the Ohio Valley
by Sunday afternoon. Overnight Saturday, upper-level energy will
produce light snow over parts of the Mid-Atlantic, ending by
Sunday evening.

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain from the
south-central to east-central U.S. and wintry weather from the
Midwest through Great Lakes and interior Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be on a
potent upper low forecast to enter the Pacific Northwest on
Monday. This feature should drop southeastward along the West
Coast early in the workweek, cross the Southwest around late
Tuesday/Wednesday, and become incorporated into a
Plains/east-central U.S. mean trough by the latter half of the
week. This evolution aloft will lead to surface cyclogenesis and
strong frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable
precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into Friday.
Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and
wintry weather are likely on the northern and western side of the
precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

00Z/06Z guidance remains more agreeable and consistent than
average for the days 3-5 Monday-Wednesday part of the forecast.
Consensus shows a strong East Pacific ridge supporting a
southeastward track for the upper low of interest, from the
Pacific Northwest during the day Monday and reaching the Southwest
by late Tuesday-early Wednesday. Meanwhile upper troughing lifts
away from the East and an initial western U.S. ridge broadens as
it continues eastward. A blend of the GFS/ECMWF/CMC/UKMET from
each model's latest available cycle represented the prevailing
themes of the forecast well. New 12Z runs are similar except for
the CMC that strays weaker/slower with the upper system Tuesday
onward, affecting its forecast farther east through the rest of
the week.

Uncertainty and guidance spread/run-to-run variability increase
somewhat during the latter half of the period. Contributors to the
differences include upstream shortwave energy forecast to drop
into and through the West during mid-late week as well as
important specifics of northern stream flow that may interact with
the leading upper low as it ejects beyond the Rockies/Plains.
These issues will affect the timing, strength, and track of low
pressure as it progresses from near the south-central Plains
northeastward after midweek. In recent runs the GFS has tended to
be a bit on the deeper side of the operational model spread (and
within the deeper part of the GEFS envelope) at some valid times
but has been trending weaker since the 00Z run. The CMC has been
on the weaker/sheared side. For early next Thursday the 12Z UKMET
has come in halfway between the 12Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF for depth.
Meanwhile the ECMWF has trended faster over the past couple days
and the new 12Z run is a bit weaker and farther east versus the
00Z run. Transitioning the 00Z/06Z model blend to include some 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input by days 6-7 Thursday-Friday accounted
for the gradual increase of uncertainty and provided good
continuity in principle. The forecast yielded a modestly stronger
system tracking northeast from the Plains, with additional room
for refinement if confidence increases.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper low/trough dropping into the West early in the week will
spread an area of precipitation across the region, but totals of
coastal/lower elevation rain and mountain snow should remain light
to moderate. However, widespread showers and thunderstorms are
likely to develop over the central U.S. by Wednesday into Thursday
as surface low pressure consolidates in the High Plains and
advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Plains, Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and
eventually the Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms could be possible,
with the current days 6-7 Storm Prediction Center outlook showing
some severe threat from parts of the southern Plains into
Tennessee Valley and vicinity. There will also be flash flooding
concerns where heavy rainfall occurs. Continue to monitor
forecasts as uncertain details of these potential threats become
better refined. At the same time, expect a band of snow in the
colder air on the northwestern periphery of the system. The best
potential for meaningful accumulations currently extends from
central parts of the Plains into the Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest/Great Lakes region into interior New England, while mixed
precipitation/ice cannot be ruled out in the transition zone
between the snow and rain. Totals/location of any snow will be
very sensitive to precise strength and track of the system. Strong
winds may be possible in the gradient between the surface low and
high pressure to the northwest, and then possibly along parts of
the East Coast within the southerly flow ahead of the storm.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week. Warmer than average
temperatures across the Central Great Basin and Southwest Monday
will moderate to near normal or slightly below Tuesday and
Wednesday underneath the incoming upper trough/low. West Coast
states should see readings rebound to moderately above normal for
the latter half of the week. Meanwhile a warming trend over the
central U.S. should peak around Tuesday-Wednesday as high
temperatures reach 10-20F above normal both days with lows 15-25F
above normal Wednesday. The system/cold front emerging from the
West will then quickly drop temperatures to 5-15F or so below
normal for Thursday-Friday. Meanwhile the midweek warmth over the
Plains will move into the East for Thursday-Friday with one or two
days of highs up to 10-20F above normal and lows exceeding 20F
above normal over some areas. This will represent a significant
warming trend for the Eastern Seaboard which can expect to start
the week with temperatures 10-20F below normal.

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the 500-hPa flow pattern
across most of the forecast domain. All models predict a ridge over the
Northeast Pacific associated with positive height anomalies near or into
southern Alaska, southwestern Canada, and over the western CONUS, similar t=
o a
compromise between yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasted 6-10 da=
y and week-2 mean 500-hPa
height forecasts. Below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast to cover centra=
l
and northern Alaska, moreso in the European and Canadian ensemble means tha=
n
the GEFS, which pushes the Northeast Pacific ridge a little farther north.
Today's models also forecast a trough trailing from eastern Canada into the
north-central and southwestern CONUS downstream from the ridge. All models
have
two separate negative height anomaly centers; one near central Canada that
extends into the northern Plains, and a smaller negative anomaly in the
south-central or southwestern CONUS. The European ensemble mean and the GEF=
S
are slightly deeper with the southern CONUS feature than the Canadian ensem=
ble
mean. The operational European model, which brought above normal 500-hPa
heights across the northern tier of states yesterday, has backed away from
this
outlier solution. Further downstream, all models point to ridging over the
eastern CONUS with positive 500-hPa anomalies stretching across most of the
mid-latitudes of the North Atlantic. Today's manual 500-hPa blend favors th=
e
ECMWF ensemble mean solution, which is relatively consistent with
teleconnections based on the positive height anomaly centered in the
northeastern Pacific, and with its earlier runs. The weights used in the
forecast consolidation tool indicate that the ECMWF ensemble temperature an=
d
precipitation forecasts have been more skillful during this season last yea=
r
and in the recent past.

Above normal temperatures are favored along the west coast of the CONUS and
over much of the eastern CONUS underneath positive 500-hPa height anomalies=
.
Meanwhile, odds favor below normal temperatures over the south-central and
southwestern CONUS near the secondary negative 500-hPa height anomaly. Abov=
e
normal temperatures are favored from parts of the northern and central Plai=
ns
towards the central Mississippi Valley. Southerly low level winds forecast =
for
the Alaska Panhandle and southern portions of the Mainland increase chances=
 of
above normal temperatures there while cold surface high pressure favors bel=
ow
normal temperatures for much of western and northern Mainland Alaska, very
similar to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast.

East of the predicted Pacific ridge, below normal precipitation is favored =
for
much of the West. Meanwhile, a storm system is expected to move through the
eastern CONUS, favoring above normal precipitation in most locations east o=
f
the Mississippi River, and across the middle Mississippi Valley.  In the wa=
ke
of this system, near to below normal precipitation is favored for much of t=
he
Plains. One or more storm systems are predicted to cross over Alaska during
the
period, favoring near to above normal precipitation for much of the state.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Slightly above average, 3 out =
of
5, due to fairly good agreement between model forecasts on the mean
circulation
pattern over most of the domain, which has also been consistent from run to
run. This is offset by the disagreements among the temperature tools for th=
e
central and western CONUS, and uncertainty in the timing of the storm syste=
m
moving through the eastern CONUS early in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 19 - 25 2022

During the week-2 period, models depict more zonal flow, though with a
slightly
more amplified mean ridge-trough couplet from the interior West through the
eastern CONUS than indicated yesterday - a slight retrogression of the 6-10
day
pattern. This is due in part to a slight retrograde of the Most models have
less run-to-run consistency than yesterday, particularly with the location =
of
the maximum positive 500-hPa height anomalies from the easern CONUS into th=
e
North Atlantic. The 0z European ensemble mean puts the maximum anomaly over
the
Middle Atlantic States while other models place the maximum anomaly as far
east
as the central North Atlantic. However, all model ensemble means have trend=
ed
westward over the past day, lending some credence to the more westward
solution
of the European ensemble mean. Meanwhile, there is some model variability i=
n
the shape of the North Pacific ridge and the height pattern across Alaska. =
The
European ensemble mean has a flat ridge in the North Pacific, and a
significant
trough farther north that has substantial negative 500-hPa height anomalies
across Alaska. The Canadian ensemble mean and the GEFS are less amplified w=
ith
the troughing across Alaska, but are trending toward the more consistent
European ensemble mean, which argues for favoring the European ensemble mea=
n
once again. In a mild shift away from yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs=
 solutions, none of the
models
put significantly above normal 500-hPa heights across the entire northern
CONUS, instead keeping a weak trough and near or slightly below normal heig=
hts
across the interior West and the Plains. This is consistent with a slightly
more amplified solution across most of the CONUS than yesterday. Finally, a=
ll
models trended toward slightly below normal 500-hPa heights in the
southwestern
CONUS, compared with little or no indication of this feature yesterday. Aga=
in,
this is consistent with a slightly more amplified pattern and is favored by
all
model trends. The ECMWF ensemble mean is favored in the week-2 period for t=
he
same reasons it's favored in the 6-10 day period.

Increasing heights predicted over most of the CONUS leads to increased chan=
ces
of near to above normal temperatures for the entire CONUS. This also agrees
with expected MJO activity. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are
highest east of the Rockies and Great Basin due to predicted downloping low
level winds, and for the Eastern Seaboard due to persistent positive height
anomalies and southerly low level flow. Odds for above normal temperatures =
are
reduced from yesterday across the western CONUS with the slight model shift
toward lower 500-hPa heights there. Consistent with the week-2 consolidatio=
n
forecast, increased odds for above normal temperatures have been extended i=
nto
southeastern Mainland Alaska, but below normal temperatures are favored in =
the
Aleutians and most of Mainland Alaska in conjunction with below normal 500h=
Pa
heights.

There is a lot of diversity among the precipitation tools despite fair
agreement in the mean week-2 pattern. The European ensemble mean has drier =
air
pushing into the eastern CONUS as compared to the other models, but this
solution is favored along with other aspects of the European ensemble mean.
Meanwhile, the evolution of the weak western CONUS trough is uncertain. The
European ensemble mean brings in elevated chances for above normal
precipitation to the east of the mean trough position, but the weak nature =
of
the mean feature and the uncertainty in the progressiveness of the trough
abets
only slight deviations from an equal-chances forecast. Below normal
precipitation is slightly favored across California and adjacent areas
upstream
from the mean trough position, but as with areas to the east, too many
uncertainties exist to allow for significant deviations from an equal-chanc=
es
forecast. Near to above normal precipitation is slightly favored for Alaska=
,
but the relatively zonal pattern keeps increased odds for wetter than norma=
l
weather low, and out of northeastern Mainland Alaska.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 25% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
relatively good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern, offset by disagreement among the temperature tools and on the
evolution of individual features, which introduces significant differences
among the precipitation tools, none of which shows significant departures f=
rom
normal in any case.

FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Extended Forecast Discussion

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to east-central U.S. and
wintry weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be on a
potent upper low/trough likely centered over northern
California/Nevada to begin the period Tuesday, which will track
eastward as the week progresses and become incorporated into a
Plains/east-central U.S. mean trough by the latter half of the
week. This evolution aloft will lead to surface cyclogenesis and
strong frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable
precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into Friday.
Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and
wintry weather are likely on the northern and western side of the
precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part, recent guidance remains more agreeable and
consistent than average for the medium range period, especially
for the early part of the forecast. Consensus has been steady in
showing the upper low moving southeastward over the southwest
quadrant of the U.S. Tuesday and Wednesday, while downstream, low
amplitude ridging broadens and shifts from the central to eastern
U.S. The CMC was the main outlier among the deterministic guidance
for the 12/18Z cycle, with a weaker and slower upper low system
indicated by Wednesday that then affects its forecast downstream
for the latter part of the week. This has persisted in the new 00Z
cycle for the CMC; it may be notable that the new 00Z ECMWF shows
a bit of a pull to the southwest with the center of the upper low
early Wednesday as well, but not to the extent of the CMC runs.
But for the early part of the WPC forecast, a blend of the 12/18Z
GFS, 12Z ECMWF, and 12Z UKMET represented the prevailing themes of
the forecast well.

Uncertainty and guidance spread/run-to-run variability increase
somewhat during the latter half of the period. Contributors to the
differences include upstream shortwave energy forecast to drop
into and through the West during mid-late week as well as
important specifics of northern stream flow that may interact with
the leading upper low as it ejects beyond the Rockies/Plains, with
some phasing differences. These issues will affect the timing,
strength, and track of low pressure as it progresses from near the
south-central Plains northeastward after midweek. However, ECMWF
and GFS runs have matched fairly well particularly in the upper
levels considering it is a day 5-7 forecast. 12/18Z GFS runs were
a bit northwest of the preferred solution of the ECMWF and
ensemble means with the surface low track Thursday-Friday, but the
00Z run appears to have come into better agreement with the low
track. Including some GEFS and EC ensemble mean input by days 6-7
Friday-Saturday accounted for the gradual increase of uncertainty
and provided good continuity from the previous forecast, with
perhaps just a slightly faster track of the main cold front and
precipitation forecast and a slightly stronger low indicated over
the Northeast early Friday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Underneath the upper low/trough over the West early in the week,
some light to moderate precipitation in the form of lower
elevation rain and mountain snow is expected for California into
the Great Basin and into the Northern Rockies, increasing in the
Central Rockies on Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will
become more widespread over the central U.S. by Wednesday into
Thursday as surface low pressure consolidates in the High Plains
and advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Plains, Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and
eventually the Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms
are possible, with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing
some severe threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and
Thursday. There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy
rainfall occurs, possibly in similar regions and into the Southern
Appalachians. Continue to monitor forecasts as uncertain details
of these potential threats become better refined. At the same
time, expect a band of snow in the colder air on the northwestern
periphery of the system. The best potential for meaningful
accumulations currently extends from central parts of the Plains
into the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest/Great Lakes region
into interior New England, while mixed precipitation/ice cannot be
ruled out in the transition zone between the snow and rain.
Totals/location of any snow will be very sensitive to precise
strength and track of the system. Strong winds may be possible in
the gradient between the surface low and high pressure to the
northwest, and then possibly along parts of the East Coast within
the southerly flow ahead of the storm.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward through the workweek ahead of
the trough/frontal system and cooler temperatures spread behind
the cold front. Highs of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F
above normal will be shunted from the Plains on Tuesday into the
Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys (while persisting in the Southern
Plains) on Wednesday, then into the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday.
On the backside of the front, temperatures should flip to near to
below average, first over the West and spreading to the Rockies,
Plains, and Midwest Wednesday and Thursday before tracking into
the eastern third of the country for the latter part of the week
while moderating. Parts of the West and into the Plains are
expected to warm up above average once again by the end of the
week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
205 AM EST Sat Feb 12 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Feb 15 2022 - 12Z Sat Feb 19 2022

...Mid-late week system to bring potential for heavy rain and
severe weather from the south-central to east-central U.S. and
wintry weather from the Midwest through Great Lakes and interior
Northeast...

...Overview...

The dominant focus of the medium range forecast will be on a
potent upper low/trough likely centered over northern
California/Nevada to begin the period Tuesday, which will track
eastward as the week progresses and become incorporated into a
Plains/east-central U.S. mean trough by the latter half of the
week. This evolution aloft will lead to surface cyclogenesis and
strong frontal systems in the central U.S., drawing moisture
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and producing notable
precipitation from the Plains eastward next Wednesday into Friday.
Expect rain and thunderstorms in southern areas, while snow and
wintry weather are likely on the northern and western side of the
precipitation shield across the central Rockies/Plains and through
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and interior Northeast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part, recent guidance remains more agreeable and
consistent than average for the medium range period, especially
for the early part of the forecast. Consensus has been steady in
showing the upper low moving southeastward over the southwest
quadrant of the U.S. Tuesday and Wednesday, while downstream, low
amplitude ridging broadens and shifts from the central to eastern
U.S. The CMC was the main outlier among the deterministic guidance
for the 12/18Z cycle, with a weaker and slower upper low system
indicated by Wednesday that then affects its forecast downstream
for the latter part of the week. This has persisted in the new 00Z
cycle for the CMC; it may be notable that the new 00Z ECMWF shows
a bit of a pull to the southwest with the center of the upper low
early Wednesday as well, but not to the extent of the CMC runs.
But for the early part of the WPC forecast, a blend of the 12/18Z
GFS, 12Z ECMWF, and 12Z UKMET represented the prevailing themes of
the forecast well.

Uncertainty and guidance spread/run-to-run variability increase
somewhat during the latter half of the period. Contributors to the
differences include upstream shortwave energy forecast to drop
into and through the West during mid-late week as well as
important specifics of northern stream flow that may interact with
the leading upper low as it ejects beyond the Rockies/Plains, with
some phasing differences. These issues will affect the timing,
strength, and track of low pressure as it progresses from near the
south-central Plains northeastward after midweek. However, ECMWF
and GFS runs have matched fairly well particularly in the upper
levels considering it is a day 5-7 forecast. 12/18Z GFS runs were
a bit northwest of the preferred solution of the ECMWF and
ensemble means with the surface low track Thursday-Friday, but the
00Z run appears to have come into better agreement with the low
track. Including some GEFS and EC ensemble mean input by days 6-7
Friday-Saturday accounted for the gradual increase of uncertainty
and provided good continuity from the previous forecast, with
perhaps just a slightly faster track of the main cold front and
precipitation forecast and a slightly stronger low indicated over
the Northeast early Friday.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Underneath the upper low/trough over the West early in the week,
some light to moderate precipitation in the form of lower
elevation rain and mountain snow is expected for California into
the Great Basin and into the Northern Rockies, increasing in the
Central Rockies on Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will
become more widespread over the central U.S. by Wednesday into
Thursday as surface low pressure consolidates in the High Plains
and advects substantial moisture from the Gulf of Mexico northward
into the Plains, Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys, and
eventually the Appalachians and Eastern Seaboard. Strong storms
are possible, with the Storm Prediction Center outlook showing
some severe threat for parts of the southern Plains into the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and vicinity on Wednesday and
Thursday. There could also be flash flooding concerns where heavy
rainfall occurs, possibly in similar regions and into the Southern
Appalachians. Continue to monitor forecasts as uncertain details
of these potential threats become better refined. At the same
time, expect a band of snow in the colder air on the northwestern
periphery of the system. The best potential for meaningful
accumulations currently extends from central parts of the Plains
into the Middle Mississippi Valley and Midwest/Great Lakes region
into interior New England, while mixed precipitation/ice cannot be
ruled out in the transition zone between the snow and rain.
Totals/location of any snow will be very sensitive to precise
strength and track of the system. Strong winds may be possible in
the gradient between the surface low and high pressure to the
northwest, and then possibly along parts of the East Coast within
the southerly flow ahead of the storm.

The change and progression of the overall pattern will be evident
in temperatures over the course of next week, as warmer than
average temperatures push eastward through the workweek ahead of
the trough/frontal system and cooler temperatures spread behind
the cold front. Highs of 10-20F above average and lows 15-30F
above normal will be shunted from the Plains on Tuesday into the
Mid-Mississippi and Ohio Valleys (while persisting in the Southern
Plains) on Wednesday, then into the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday.
On the backside of the front, temperatures should flip to near to
below average, first over the West and spreading to the Rockies,
Plains, and Midwest Wednesday and Thursday before tracking into
the eastern third of the country for the latter part of the week
while moderating. Parts of the West and into the Plains are
expected to warm up above average once again by the end of the
week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 AM CST Sat Feb 12 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Regional fire weather concerns are expected again today as windy
conditions develop across the southern Plains and offshore winds
continue over coastal southern California.

...Southern Plains...
Morning surface observations show a cold front draped from the upper
OH River Valley into the southern Plains. This boundary will
continue to push south/southeast through the day and should reach
the northwestern Gulf by this afternoon. As this occurs, strong
gusty winds will develop along/behind the front amid strong
low-level cold advection. Sustained winds between 15-25 mph are
expected from southern TX to southern OK, and gusts up to 30-40 mph
will be possible. Drier air will continue to filter into the region
and may support RH reductions into the 20-30% range. Confidence in
elevated fire weather conditions remains highest across north TX and
southern OK where the probability of windy conditions overlapping
with sufficient dry air for at least 2-3 hours remains the highest.
While confidence is somewhat lower, elevated conditions may evolve
into southern TX late this afternoon, but fuel conditions are not as
receptive.

...Coastal Southern California...
Early-morning observations show elevated to critical wind/RH
conditions ongoing across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. These
conditions will persist through the morning to early afternoon hours
as the regional pressure gradient continues to strengthen. Latest
hi-res guidance suggests that the LAX-DAG pressure gradient will be
maximized between 12-18 UTC. While this doesn't align perfectly with
the diurnal cycle, persistent downslope flow will maintain 15-20% RH
values for much of the day. Wind gusts between 30-50 mph are likely
during this period and will support elevated to critical fire
weather conditions. Fire danger will be highest in areas that have
seen prolonged downslope flow and drier fine fuels, but a more
robust/widespread threat is not anticipated due to high live fuel
moisture.

...Central High Plains...
Elevated fire weather conditions may develop this afternoon across
southeast WY into adjacent areas of NE and CO. Downslope winds are
expected to increase to 15-25 mph across the central to northern
High Plains, and RH values are forecast to fall largely into the
25-35% range. A few locations over the central High Plains could
fall to near 20% where downslope flow may be stronger. However,
confidence in the coverage and duration of these conditions is low
and mainly depicted by more aggressive model solutions. Although
recent observations are in line with more modest ensemble means, RH
trends will be monitored given the relatively dry fuel conditions
across the region.

...Light snowfall possible across parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Sunday...

...Bitter cold temperatures located over the Midwest and Great
Lakes while record breaking warmth continues through the end of
the weekend across California...

Overall, only light precipitation is expected across most of the
Nation over the next few days as a strong cold front pushes into
the Gulf of Mexico today and off the East Coast by Sunday. This
will allow for a relatively dry airmass to dominate the Lower 48.
Additionally, weak and moisture-starved low pressure systems are
forecast to dive into the north-central U.S. during this time
frame. Farther east, a strengthening upper-level jet streak over
the Northeast will support a blossoming area of light snow late
Saturday night over the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic. As
temperatures drastically cool during the nighttime hours and
behind the advancing cold front, snow is expected to accumulate
into Sunday morning from Virginia to southern New England.
Snowfall totals are generally expected to remain below 4 inches,
with the greatest potential for locally higher amounts found in
the Shenandoah region of Virginia. Snow showers should come to an
end throughout most areas by Sunday afternoon, with lingering
wintry weather found along the immediate Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
coastline and southern New England into Sunday night.

Elsewhere, continued cold air advection over the Great Lakes will
produce lake effect snow showers through the beginning of the
week. Maximum snowfall amounts of 6 to 8 inches are possible
across far southwest Michigan, where Winter Weather Advisories are
in effect. Scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms are
possible today across southeast Texas as the aforementioned cold
front pushes southward. For the same reason, rain chances are also
expected to increase on Sunday across Florida.

After one last afternoon of springlike warmth along the East Coast
today, a bitter cold airmass located over the Midwest and Great
Lakes is poised to surge into the region by Sunday. This will lead
to much of the Eastern U.S. experiencing below average
temperatures through Valentine's Day. The core of the cold air,
with subzero high temperatures, is forecast to remain over the
Upper Midwest. Wind Chill Warnings are in effect across the
Minnesota Arrowhead, while Wind Chill Advisories extend into
eastern North Dakota, northeast South Dakota, much of Minnesota,
and far northern Iowa. Residents in these regions are urged to
take proper precautions while outdoors, as dangerously cold wind
chills could cause frostbite on exposed skin in as little as 10
minutes.

Meanwhile, record breaking warmth is once again in the forecast
over parts of California today thanks to a stagnant upper-level
ridge in place. Highs into the 70s and 80s will have the potential
to break several daily records. For Southern California, highs
into the low 90s are possible both today and Sunday, which has
prompted Heat Advisories to be issued. The combination of low
relative humidity and gusty winds has also led to the potential
for elevated fire weather across the region. This stretch of
abnormally warm weather is forecast to finally diminish by Monday
as an approaching frontal system enters the Pacific Northwest.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CST Sat Feb 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist for parts of coastal southern
California, but weak winds over the central CONUS will limit fire
weather potential despite dry conditions.

...Southern California...
Although the regional pressure gradient will slacken over the next
36-48 hours, offshore flow will likely persist into Sunday. The
LAX-DAG gradient is expected to linger between -2 to -5 mb, which
should support wind gusts between 20-30 mph within the higher
terrain. With no onshore flow expected through the period, relative
humidities will remain depressed between 15-20% in the lee of higher
terrain. This will support another day of elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions. The fire weather potential will be
more prevalent for areas that have seen several days of downslope
flow and drying of fine fuels, but higher live fuel moisture across
the broader area will limit a more robust threat.

...Central to Southern Plains...
Surface high pressure over the Plains will gradually give way to lee
troughing through the day. This will result in generally weak winds
near 15 mph, but a few areas may see winds increase to near 20 mph.
Furthermore, little to no moisture return into the region will yield
widespread RH values in the 25-35% range. A few locations may see
periods of elevated conditions where reduced RH and breezy winds can
overlap. Ensemble guidance hints that this is most likely across
eastern WY in the lee of the Rockies, but notable spread limits
confidence in the fire weather potential.

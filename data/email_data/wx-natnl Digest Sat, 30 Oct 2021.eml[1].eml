Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1112 AM CDT Fri Oct 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Based on current observations and recent guidance, areas within the
Texas Panhandle and South Plains seem less likely to observe
sustained elevated conditions today. Locally elevated conditions
remain possible, however, as fine fuels are dry. Gusty winds with
lowered RH appear likely from western Oklahoma into parts of central
Texas. The greatest relative risk will exist in southwest Oklahoma
into western North Texas where RH could near 15%. Fuels in both
these regions remain marginally dry due to recent rainfall, but
locally elevated conditions are possible where fine fuels can dry
out. The forecast remains unchanged in the Edwards Plateau and South
Texas.

..Wendt.. 10/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Fri Oct 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large upper low, currently over the Tennessee Valley, will move
northeast into the Ohio Valley through the day today. A surface low
will also accompany this upper low and follow a similar path. On the
western periphery of this broad cyclone, dry and windy northerly
winds are expected across portions of the southern Plains. This is
forecast to occur as a result of a strong surface pressure gradient
as well as deep mixing. This will lead to strengthening surface
winds across much of western and central Oklahoma into a large
portion of northern/central and southern Texas. However, much of
this area has seen significant rainfall recently. Therefore, the
elevated outline has been confined to western portions of this area
where little to no recent rainfall has fallen and fuels are drier.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: An end to the growing season is becoming more likely by the
beginning
of week-2 over a large portion of the eastern half of the contiguous U.S.
Surface high pressure is favored to expand over the region resulting in
anomalously cold temperatures across the region early in the period, with m=
any
interior locations possibly experiencing subfreezing temperatures overnight=
.
After a predicted lull in precipitation along the West Coast from this week=
end
into early next week, above-normal precipitation is expected to return to t=
he
Pacific Northwest and northern California during week-2. As the storm track
shifts south over the North Pacific, the risk for hazardous weather across
Alaska is expected to diminish.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Souther=
n
Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys,
Appalachians, and the interior mid-Atlantic, Sat, Nov 6.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the central and
eastern U.S., Sat-Mon, Nov 6-8.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and northern
California, Sat-Fri, Nov 6-12.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Cascades and the northern portions of the
Great Basin and Rockies, Sat-Fri, Nov 6-12.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the northwestern U.S., Sat-Fri, Nov
6-12.

FOR SATURDAY NOVEMBER 06 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 12: The coldest temperatures so =
far
this fall season are likely to occur across the central U.S. at the beginni=
ng
of November, with this relatively cold air mass expected to overspread the
remainder of the central and eastern U.S. during week-1 and persist into th=
e
early part of week-2. The predicted overnight temperatures, while certainly
colder than those in recent weeks, are not considered too unusual for early
November, with anomalies generally in the -5 to -10 deg F range. The ECMWF
reforecast tool remains the most bullish with probabilities exceeding 60
percent that minimum temperatures fall into the lowest 15th percentile over
much of the eastern half of the CONUS on 11/6 and 11/7. The GEFS reforecast
tool maintains lower probabilities for minimum temperatures reaching this
threshold (20-30 percent) compared to the ECMWF reforecast tool, with most
areas having probabilities drop below 20 percent after 11/7. A moderate ris=
k
for much below normal temperatures continues on 11/6 across portions of the
Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys,
Appalachians, and the interior mid-Atlantic where a frost or freeze is more
likely (at least a 40% chance in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools).
The
slight risk for much below normal temperatures extends closer to the Gulf
Coast
and includes areas where temperature tools depict at least a 20 percent cha=
nce
of minimum temperatures falling below 40 deg F, supporting the potential fo=
r
frost. Due to the increasing differences between the GEFS and ECMWF
temperature
reforecast tools later in the period, the slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is discontinued after 11/8. While overnight temperatures in th=
e
30s deg F are still possible across the northern half of the CONUS througho=
ut
week-2, these temperatures begin to fall more in line with climatology, and
less agricultural impacts are expected after the initial first frost/freeze=
.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in good agreement that an amplified
500-hPa trough develops over the northeast Pacific with enhanced Pacific fl=
ow
returning to western North America during week-2. However, both models have
trended toward more ridging over the western CONUS, which would place the
greatest moisture flow further to the north compared to yesterday. While an
atmospheric river event is still likely, probabilities for  heavy
precipitation
have trended downward since yesterday, particularly in the 6z GEFS. Therefo=
re,
the moderate risks for heavy precipitation and snow are discontinued. A sli=
ght
risk of heavy precipitation remains posted for all of week-2 for northern
California and the Pacific Northwest where there is at least a 20 percent
chance for 3-day precipitation totals greater than the 85th percentile and =
1.5
inches over most areas in the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast guidance. Most of t=
he
coastal Pacific Northwest and northern California has received more than 10
inches of liquid equivalent precipitation during the past month. Due to the
antecedent wetness, additional heavy rain could trigger flooding. Also, hea=
vy
rain may lead to mudslides and debris flows in burn scar areas. A slight ri=
sk
of heavy snow (6 inches or more in 24-hours) is also highlighted across the
Cascades as well as northern portions of the Rockies and Great Basin for al=
l
of
week-2, given the anticipated inland propagation of the moisture flow,
combined
with cold air in place at the higher elevations. The heavy snow hazard is
removed over the Sierra Nevadas due to the higher mid-level heights forecas=
t
across California, although some snow still cannot be ruled out at some poi=
nt
during the period should the moisture flow progress far enough to the south=
.
The amplified 500-hPa trough also supports a slight risk of high winds for
much
of the northwestern CONUS throughout week-2.



Both the 0z and 6z deterministic GFS, as well as the 0z ECMWF depict a
deepening surface low in the eastern CONUS around the middle portion of
week-2.
Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict some areas of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast with at least a 20 percent chance for 3-da=
y
rainfall totals above the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inch related=
 to
frontal activity and return flow around surface high pressure. However, the
uncalibrated ensemble guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF generally depict
precipitation amounts of less than a half inch in a 24-hour period, with th=
e
mean trough axis placement too far east in the ensemble means to support
surface low pressure in the eastern U.S. For this reason, no related hazard=
s
are highlighted at this time.



No hazards are highlighted for Alaska, with the mean mid-level moisture flo=
w
forecast to be mainly south of the state. Although some episodes of heavy
precipitation are possible in the Panhandle, especially further south,
precipitation totals are forecast to remain below hazards thresholds. The
anomalous troughing over the northeastern Pacific predicted during week-2
favors increased chances for near to below normal temperatures over Alaska.
However, minimum temperatures are not expected to be cold enough to warrant
any
related hazards.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 PM EDT Fri Oct 29 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 01 2021 - 12Z Fri Nov 05 2021

...Overview...

Expect a fairly persistent upper-level pattern during the medium
range period. A strong mean ridge will be over western Canada with
a more modest ridge over the western U.S., leading to a mean
trough extending from the eastern half of Canada into the central
and eastern U.S. The overall ridge-trough pattern should drift a
bit eastward by Thursday-Friday. At least a couple Pacific
shortwaves will reach the West Coast with some of the energy
deflected northward by the Canadian ridge and the rest passing
through the West. After midweek the Pacific energy may either
temporarily dampen the western U.S. ridge or push it eastward into
the Rockies/Plains. These impulses and associated frontal systems
will produce rounds of precipitation over the West. Farther
eastward, chilly surface high pressure behind a cold front will
promote below normal temperatures across the central U.S. and
increasingly more of the East. Waviness along the front may
enhance rainfall over the Southern Plains and possibly into the
Lower Mississippi Valley around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance offers some similarities for the large scale pattern
but there are a number of important detail differences that
generally do not appear to have great predictability at longer
time ranges. With respect to the Pacific shortwaves, the GFS is on
the faster side of the spread of the leading feature that reaches
the Pacific Northwest and vicinity during the first part of the
week. Historical biases, as well as a recent tendency for any
solution that eroded the Canadian upper ridge more than consensus
to revert back eventually, would support less weight on the GFS
scenario. Meanwhile the GFS becomes stronger and slower with the
portion of the leading shortwave that continues along in the
southern stream--leading to a stronger/slower southern tier wave
by Thursday-Friday. Recent GFS runs have also been on the
strong/fast side with what energy reaches the northwestern
U.S./western Canada after midweek while being weaker than recent
ECMWF runs and 00Z CMC with the southern part of the overall
shortwave. Tendencies again favor a more robust Canadian ridge
than in the GFS (12Z run trended stronger than the 06Z run) but
otherwise the wide spread seen in ensemble spaghetti plots by late
next week plus unsurprising changes in the 12Z runs leave little
confidence in any specific solution. Due in part to these eastern
Pacific/western North American differences, guidance continues to
have difficulty in resolving the specifics of the central-eastern
U.S. upper trough. Aforementioned traits of the GFS have led it to
become weaker than consensus with the eastern trough. Other
GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs have displayed either an open trough or an
embedded closed low anywhere from southern Canada or the Great
Lakes into the Midwest/Ohio Valley. Thus far no model has been
very consistent. Recent trends have been toward enough eastern
troughing aloft to keep the surface pattern suppressed over the
eastern states (which the ensemble means have been more steady
with over recent days), shifting the most likely surface low track
into the western Atlantic by Friday. At that time the latest
GEFS/ECMWF means depict a wave reaching offshore the New England
coast. The 00Z ECMWF/CMC were closest to that idea while the new
00Z CMC is slower.

Based on the above considerations, the 00Z/06Z operational model
blend used in the first half of the period gave somewhat less
weight to the GFS than might typically be the case. Then the
forecast quickly adjusted to a blend incorporating 40-60 percent
total weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means with the remaining
input from the 00Z ECMWF/CMC.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The frontal systems and shortwaves coming into the West will cause
periods of enhanced precipitation--first on Monday and then
Wednesday into Friday. Northern California and far southwestern
Oregon should see the heaviest precipitation, with some spreading
into the Pacific Northwest (especially during the latter period)
and lesser totals eastward into the Intermountain West and
Rockies, with normal terrain enhancements and higher elevation
snow. Some snow/rain may extend into the central High Plains on
Monday into Tuesday but amounts remaining uncertain (most likely
light to locally moderate). Then the combination of moisture and
southern stream shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system
across the south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the Southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the Central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow but with low confidence in the specifics.

Behind the cold front and underneath high pressure, well below
normal temperatures are likely across the central and eastern U.S.
This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across more Mississippi Valley and
eastern U.S. Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as
Kansas and Iowa, more moderate minus 5-10F anomalies that would
still bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so. Expect
above normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft but
periods of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal
over California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 04 - 08 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model solutions a=
re in agreement with
respect
to the mean 500-hPa height pattern over Alaska, but large uncertainty remai=
ns
in the mid-level height pattern over much of the CONUS during the 6-10 day
period. The most notable difference is depicted in the strength and locatio=
n
of
the largest negative mid-level height anomalies over the eastern CONUS.
Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
manual 500-hPa height blend favors near- to above-normal mid-level heights
from
the southwestern CONUS to the Northern High Plains, and eastward to the
western
Great Lakes. Negative height anomalies are the most likely outcome in the
Pacific Northwest, ahead of a mean trough over the Northeast Pacific. A mea=
n,
positively-tilted trough over the eastern CONUS favors below-normal mid-lev=
el
heights for the Central and Southern Plains, and most of the eastern CONUS
east
of the Mississippi River. Over Alaska, negative 500-hPa height anomalies ar=
e
favored across much of the Panhandle, southern Mainland coast, and across t=
he
southwest Mainland and eastern Aleutians, with near- to above-normal height=
s
predicted elsewhere across the state.

Mean surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska favors predominantly
southerly flow and elevated odds of above-normal temperatures across easter=
n
Alaska. To the northwest of this surface low pressure, easterly and norther=
ly
winds increase probabilities of near- to below-normal temperatures across
western Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Near-normal temperature
probabilities are favored across the West Coast of the CONUS, as models dep=
ict
varying intensities of mid-level height anomalies over the region. In
addition,
below-normal sea surface temperatures and warm, southwesterly mean flow wil=
l
act to offset one another. A moderation of temperatures is predicted across
much of the interior West, leading to above-normal temperature probabilitie=
s
from the Four Corners region northward. The timing of this moderation sligh=
tly
differs between the ECMWF ensemble and GEFS model guidance, indicated by a
large coverage of near-normal and weak above-normal probabilities across th=
e
Northern Plains and central Rockies, respectively. Over most of the eastern
two-thirds of the CONUS, an amplified mean trough leads to enhanced chances=
 of
below-normal temperatures east of the Rockies.

Underneath predominantly southerly surface flow, with some influence from w=
eak
onshore flow from the Beaufort Sea, above-normal precipitation is favored
across northeastern Mainland Alaska. Below-normal precipitation is weakly
favored across southwestern Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians, to t=
he
northwest of mean surface low pressure over the Northeast Pacific.
Probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the western CONUS are
enhanced as a mean mid-level trough increases onshore flow in the West. Due=
 to
large differences in the strength and location of surface high pressure ove=
r
the eastern CONUS among the models, there is great uncertainty in the
resulting
precipitation fields across the central CONUS, with the GEFS favoring
wetter-than-normal conditions and the ECMWF ensemble favoring drier
conditions,
leading to near-normal precipitation being favored across much of the Centr=
al
and High Plains. In the Southwest and across the north-central CONUS,
below-normal precipitation is favored, underneath predominantly positive
mid-level height anomalies. Along and ahead of the mean trough axis in the
eastern CONUS, above-normal precipitation is favored.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=

due to poor agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF and GEF=
S ensemble model solutions
in
the predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern across much of the CONUS, and the
resulting temperature and precipitation fields across the central CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 06 - 12 2021

The week-2 mean 500-hPa height pattern depicts positive heights stretching
from
the southwestern CONUS northeastward to the Upper Midwest. Below-normal
mid-level heights are predicted over the Pacific Northwest, ahead of a mean
trough over the Northeast Pacific. Eastward progression of the mean trough
from
the 6-10 day period is expected to continue across the eastern CONUS, but
heights are favored to remain below-normal for the week-2 period. Over Alas=
ka,
uncertainty is increased, relative to the 6-10 day period, with respect to
mean
500-hPa heights over much of the northern Mainland, indicated by weak heigh=
t
anomalies. However, much of southern Alaska from the Southwest Mainland to =
the
Panhandle is likely to experience an increased influence from amplified
troughing over the Northeast Pacific, leading to below-normal mid-level
heights. Amplified ridging over the western Bering Sea favors positive 500-=
hPa
height anomalies over the central and western Aleutians.

The slight eastward progression of the mean trough over the Northeast Pacif=
ic
increases easterly surface flow to the north across Alaska, leading to
enhanced
below-normal temperature probabilities across the western Mainland, extendi=
ng
eastward along the southern Mainland coast and into the Panhandle. Farther =
to
the south, above-normal temperatures are favored for much of the west-centr=
al
CONUS, and eastward across the Northern Tier to the Great Lakes, as near- t=
o
above-normal mid-level heights are favored across these areas. Despite
increased uncertainty with respect to the strength of the negative mid-leve=
l
height anomalies across the eastern CONUS, below-normal temperatures are
favored during week-2. However, temperatures are likely to moderate toward =
the
end of the period as surface high pressure progresses eastward.

With continued eastward progression of the mean mid-level trough over the
Northeast Pacific, increased easterly and northeasterly flow favors near- t=
o
below-normal precipitation across most of Alaska. The eastward progression =
of
this trough also favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitatio=
n
across much of the northwestern CONUS due to increased onshore flow.
Uncertainty in the strength and location of surface high pressure over the
eastern CONUS, and the timing of its eastward progression, lead to large
uncertainties in the timing and strength of potential return flow on the
feature=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs western periphery during week-2. As suc=
h, near-normal
precipitation
is favored across much of the Great Plains. Statistical and dynamical model
guidance agrees well with elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities
across the Southeast, extending northward along the East Coast, along and
ahead
of a mean mid-level trough. Behind this trough, below-normal precipitation =
is
favored across the Great Lakes. In the southwestern CONUS, predominantly
anticyclonic mid-level flow favors below-normal precipitation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Much below average, 1 out of 5=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of New
England Saturday into Sunday morning...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Plains through Saturday morning...

A deep area of low pressure over parts of the Ohio
Valley/Mid-Atlantic will move northward into Eastern Canada on
Sunday. The system will produce rain, heavy at times, over parts
of the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic southward to the
Central Gulf Coast/Southeast that will move into the Northeast
overnight.  Accordingly, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic through
Saturday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most.  On Saturday, the threat of excessive
rainfall moves northward to parts of New England, with the WPC
issuing a Slight Risk on Saturday into Sunday morning.  On Sunday,
the system produces rain over parts of the Northeast,  the Lower
Great Lakes, and the Central Appalachians.

Meanwhile, a cold front extending from the Northern High Plains to
Northern California will move to the Upper Great Lakes to the
Southern Plains and westward to the Central Rockies by Sunday. The
system will produce mainly light rain over parts of the Pacific
Northwest portions of Northern California into the Northern
Rockies. Overnight, light snow will develop over parts of the
Northern Rockies, ending by Saturday evening.  Light rain will
continue over parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern California
through Sunday.  Furthermore, as the cold front moves into the
Great Lakes, light rain will develop over the region on Sunday
afternoon into Sunday evening.

Elsewhere, dry conditions and breezy northwesterly surface winds
will develop over parts of the Southern Plains, producing an area
favorable for fire weather through Saturday morning; hence regions
of Elevated Risk of fire weather exists over parts of the Southern
Plains through Saturday morning. Moreover, there is a Frost
Advisory over parts of eastern Kansas from late Friday night into
Saturday morning.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
453 PM EDT Fri Oct 29 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 1 2021 - 12Z Fri Nov 5 2021

...Overview...

Expect a fairly persistent upper-level pattern during the medium
range period. A strong mean ridge will be over western Canada with
a more modest ridge over the western U.S., leading to a mean
trough extending from the eastern half of Canada into the central
and eastern U.S. The overall ridge-trough pattern should drift a
bit eastward by Thursday-Friday. At least a couple Pacific
shortwaves will reach the West Coast with some of the energy
deflected northward by the Canadian ridge and the rest passing
through the West. After midweek the Pacific energy may either
temporarily dampen the western U.S. ridge or push it eastward into
the Rockies/Plains. These impulses and associated frontal systems
will produce rounds of precipitation over the West. Farther
eastward, chilly surface high pressure behind a cold front will
promote below normal temperatures across the central U.S. and
increasingly more of the East. Waviness along the front may
enhance rainfall over the Southern Plains and possibly into the
Lower Mississippi Valley around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Most guidance offers some similarities for the large scale pattern
but there are a number of important detail differences that
generally do not appear to have great predictability at longer
time ranges. With respect to the Pacific shortwaves, the GFS is on
the faster side of the spread of the leading feature that reaches
the Pacific Northwest and vicinity during the first part of the
week. Historical biases, as well as a recent tendency for any
solution that eroded the Canadian upper ridge more than consensus
to revert back eventually, would support less weight on the GFS
scenario. Meanwhile the GFS becomes stronger and slower with the
portion of the leading shortwave that continues along in the
southern stream--leading to a stronger/slower southern tier wave
by Thursday-Friday. Recent GFS runs have also been on the
strong/fast side with what energy reaches the northwestern
U.S./western Canada after midweek while being weaker than recent
ECMWF runs and 00Z CMC with the southern part of the overall
shortwave. Tendencies again favor a more robust Canadian ridge
than in the GFS (12Z run trended stronger than the 06Z run) but
otherwise the wide spread seen in ensemble spaghetti plots by late
next week plus unsurprising changes in the 12Z runs leave little
confidence in any specific solution. Due in part to these eastern
Pacific/western North American differences, guidance continues to
have difficulty in resolving the specifics of the central-eastern
U.S. upper trough. Aforementioned traits of the GFS have led it to
become weaker than consensus with the eastern trough. Other
GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs have displayed either an open trough or an
embedded closed low anywhere from southern Canada or the Great
Lakes into the Midwest/Ohio Valley. Thus far no model has been
very consistent. Recent trends have been toward enough eastern
troughing aloft to keep the surface pattern suppressed over the
eastern states (which the ensemble means have been more steady
with over recent days), shifting the most likely surface low track
into the western Atlantic by Friday. At that time the latest
GEFS/ECMWF means depict a wave reaching offshore the New England
coast. The 00Z ECMWF/CMC were closest to that idea while the new
00Z CMC is slower.

Based on the above considerations, the 00Z/06Z operational model
blend used in the first half of the period gave somewhat less
weight to the GFS than might typically be the case. Then the
forecast quickly adjusted to a blend incorporating 40-60 percent
total weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means with the remaining
input from the 00Z ECMWF/CMC.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The frontal systems and shortwaves coming into the West will cause
periods of enhanced precipitation--first on Monday and then
Wednesday into Friday. Northern California and far southwestern
Oregon should see the heaviest precipitation, with some spreading
into the Pacific Northwest (especially during the latter period)
and lesser totals eastward into the Intermountain West and
Rockies, with normal terrain enhancements and higher elevation
snow. Some snow/rain may extend into the central High Plains on
Monday into Tuesday but amounts remaining uncertain (most likely
light to locally moderate). Then the combination of moisture and
southern stream shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system
across the south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the Southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the Central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow but with low confidence in the specifics.

Behind the cold front and underneath high pressure, well below
normal temperatures are likely across the central and eastern U.S.
This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across more Mississippi Valley and
eastern U.S. Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as
Kansas and Iowa, more moderate minus 5-10F anomalies that would
still bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so. Expect
above normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft but
periods of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal
over California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Sat Oct 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Gusty north winds are expected in the central High Plains today in
the wake of a cold front which will move south through the region.
Some areas will have relative humidity in the 15 to 25 percent
range. However, most of the areas where dry and windy conditions are
expected to overlap has seen recent rainfall. Therefore, the overall
fire weather threat is expected to be mostly limited due to high
fuel moisture. Elsewhere, cool and moist conditions are expected
which will keep fire weather concerns minimal.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Cool/moist conditions are expected across the majority of the CONUS
on Sunday. Some dry and occasionally breezy conditions may occur
across portions of the Southwest and Great Basin. Increased winds
may occur as a result of a deeply mixed boundary layer and
moderately strong mid-level westerly flow aloft. However, relative
humidity is not expected to be that dry (20 to 30 percent) and fuels
in the area are not critically dry.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Sat Oct 30 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Nov 02 2021 - 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021

...Overview...

An established strong ridge over western Canada and troughing
across the eastern half of Canada stretching into the
north-central and northeastern parts of the U.S. will be
persistent during the medium range period, while shifting a bit
eastward during the latter part of the week. At least a couple
Pacific shortwaves will reach the West Coast with some of the
energy deflected northward by the Canadian ridge and the rest
passing through the West, which may dampen any ridging that
expands into the western U.S. as well as causing rounds of
precipitation there. Farther eastward, chilly surface high
pressure behind a cold front will promote below normal
temperatures across the central U.S. and increasingly more of the
East. Enhanced rainfall is likely over the Southern Plains and
into the Lower Mississippi Valley around midweek in the vicinity
of that front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

12/18Z model guidance offers some similarities for the large scale
pattern, but there are a number of important detail differences
that generally do not appear to have great predictability at
longer time ranges. Differences arise as early as
Tuesday-Wednesday with a southern stream shortwave moving across
the Four Corners, with the 12Z CMC the weakest deterministic model
with this feature, as well as shortwave energy coming to the
Northwest, where the 12Z CMC is somewhat aggressive in this energy
digging into the Northern Rockies compared to other guidance. For
the most part a multi-model deterministic blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET with less emphasis on the CMC served as a
compromise to minimize individual model differences with these
features.

Meanwhile, shortwave differences also appear within the eastern
trough. The ECMWF has shown run-to-run discontinuities in its
solutions with the strength of energy digging through the western
side of the trough, and the 12Z ECMWF shows a compact low closing
off for a time as it drops through the Plains around Thursday,
while the new 00Z run spins up a closed low in the Ohio Valley by
Friday. GFS runs have shown less propensity for digging energy
causing such a pattern and could be too weak, while the 12Z CMC is
stronger but takes a different approach with handling it,
separating a closed low more from the northern stream trough by
Friday as it moves over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. The new 00Z
CMC backs off from this solution though the new 00Z ECMWF is
actually not too different from the 12Z CMC. The eventual
evolution of this eastern trough will also determine how a low
pressure and frontal system ends up evolving likely offshore of
the East Coast in the western Atlantic. Overall confidence is low
in these specifics given the differences in the deterministic
guidance as well as a broad range of solutions shown in ensemble
spaghetti plots. The WPC model blend for Thursday onward utilized
the ECMWF/GFS/EC mean/GEFS mean, but favored an increasing
proportion of the 12Z EC ensemble mean over the operational EC and
GEFS, as it had some hint of digging energy on the western side of
the trough without going overboard.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The frontal systems and shortwaves approaching the West will cause
periods of enhanced precipitation during the second half of the
week. Northern California and far southwestern Oregon should see
the heaviest precipitation, with some spreading into the Pacific
Northwest and lesser totals eastward into the Intermountain West
and Rockies, with normal terrain enhancements and higher elevation
snow. Some snow/rain may extend into the central High Plains on
Tuesday and Wednesday, but amounts remain uncertain (most likely
light to locally moderate). Then the combination of moisture and
southern stream shortwave energy interacting with a frontal system
across the south-central U.S. will increase rainfall chances
Tuesday-Wednesday for the Southern Plains and possibly into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley, with some heavy rain possible.
Some precipitation could spread east/northeast during the latter
part of the week, with the higher elevations of the Central
Appalachians and the interior Northeast seeing some possibility
for snow, but with low confidence in the specifics.

Behind the cold front and underneath high pressure, well below
normal temperatures are likely across the central and eastern U.S.
This will especially be the case for highs which should be 10-20F
below average from the central and eventually southern parts of
the Plains and spreading across the Mississippi Valley and eastern
U.S. Chilly lows in the 20s may reach as far south as Kansas and
Iowa, which would only be minus 5-10F anomalies but would still
bring the first freeze around next Tuesday or so. Expect above
normal low temperatures under the western ridge aloft, but periods
of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat below normal over
California on most days and near normal elsewhere.

...Strong storm system will continue to bring heavy rain, gusty
winds, and coastal flooding to the East Coast...

...Scattered rain and snow showers likely from the Pacific
Northwest to the High Plains...

...Cold front to bring cooler weather to much of the Plains by
Sunday...


A powerful storm system moving through the eastern half of the
country that brought heavy rains and coastal flooding to the
Mid-Atlantic on Friday will continue northeastward through the
weekend. An anomalously strong area of low pressure in the Ohio
Valley will meander northeastward with an occluded front arching
around back to the south over the Atlantic Ocean. Onshore flow
from the Atlantic ahead of the front will continue to funnel
moisture westward across the Northeast and around the the system,
fueling widespread showers and heavy rain. The focus for flooding
concerns will be on New England Saturday, where a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for portions of southern Maine.
Rainfall totals of 2-4 inches are forecast. A broader Marginal
Risk is out for the region with widespread totals of 1-2 inches
likely. Gusty winds will also continue and Gale Warnings are in
effect along the Atlantic Coast. Coastal flooding will remain a
concern for the Mid-Atlantic as well with warnings in place for
both the coast and the Chesapeake Bay into early Sunday. More
widespread, lighter showers will continue across the Midwest, Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys, and southern Appalachians on Saturday
around the expansive storm system. Most of the showers will move
out by Sunday night. Additionally, temperatures behind the front
in the South will be rather cool for this time of year, with highs
from the mid-50s across portions of Tennessee, Alabama, and
Georgia to the mid-60s along the central Gulf Coast. A gradual
warm-up is expected Sunday into Monday.

To the west, a cold front will continue to move southward through
the Plains while stalling across the Rockies and Great Basin.
Scattered rain and snow showers are likely in the Northern Rockies
on Saturday, with some showers and thunderstorms also forecast for
parts of northern California and southern Oregon. The showers will
spread into the Central Rockies and High Plains throughout the day
Sunday as the cold front continues southward. Snow showers are
likely not only for the higher elevations in the Rockies and Black
Hills, but also for the High Plains into Sunday night.
Accumulations are expected to generally remain light with this
system.  After a frost this morning across portions of the Central
and Southern Plains, temperatures will rapidly warm into the upper
60s to mid-70s, with some mid-80s possible for the Southern High
Plains. However, colder temperatures will spread southward on
Sunday, with highs in the 40s for the Northern Plains, 50s in the
Central Plains, and lower to mid-60s reaching portions of the
Southern Plains.

Elsewhere, generally dry and seasonable conditions are expected
for most of California and the Southwest, stretching east into
southern Texas. Some showers are possible across the Florida
Peninsula. A storm system in the Pacific will approach the coast
of the Pacific Northwest and northern California on Sunday night
with increasing rain chances.

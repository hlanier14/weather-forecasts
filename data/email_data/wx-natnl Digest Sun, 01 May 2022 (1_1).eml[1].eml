Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 301700Z - 011200Z

...Southern High Plains...
Morning surface observations show strong gradient winds across
western KS into eastern CO with 20-30 mph sustained winds gusting
above 40 mph at times. While RH values remain above critical
thresholds, a drying trend is noted over the past couple of hours as
diurnal heating increases. Winds will gradually diminish through the
day, but will likely remain strong enough for a few hours of
elevated conditions. Further south across west TX, ongoing elevated
conditions are expected to diminish by early afternoon as surface
high pressure builds over the region. Areas of elevated conditions
remain likely for portions of central/northeastern NM as winds
increase on the western periphery of the surface high this
afternoon.

...Southern Nevada...
Although winds are currently benign across the region, latest
guidance has trended towards higher probability for sustained
elevated conditions this afternoon/evening across southern NV.
Downslope winds off the southern Sierra Nevada will increase ahead
of a weak surface low and attendant cold front. Winds near 15 mph
may gust to 30 mph and will likely be coincident with RH reductions
into the low teens. Given the recently drying fuels, an Elevated
risk area is introduced.

..Moore.. 04/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CDT Sat Apr 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
Shortwave ridging aloft will build into central and southern Rockies
today. To the west, the next shortwave trough will move into the
northern Great Basin by early Sunday morning. At the surface, the
overall pressure pattern will be relatively weak in the High Plains
region. With the trough approaching, a surface low will likely
develop in the southern Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
Marginally elevated conditions may develop within the broader
region. At present, the most likely areas for this to occur are
southeast Colorado into parts of the Panhandles and parts of
central/eastern New Mexico. Dry flow around the surface ridge will
support RH into the 5-20% range. Winds will mostly remain light, but
15-20 mph for a couple of hours is possible in the highlighted
regions.

...Southern Nevada...
As fuels are now starting to become critically dry, locally elevated
conditions are possible as winds increase toward the late afternoon.
While 5-20% RH is possible, winds of 15-20 mph are not expected to
be more than brief given the weak surface pattern and mid-level
winds displaced to the west.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO NEW
MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on recent fuel guidance and trends in latest model
solutions. Confidence in widespread critical fire weather conditions
remains high across northern AZ into western and central NM.
Localized critical conditions may extend as far north as northeast
UT/northwest CO into far southwest WY, but marginal fuel status as
well as clouds and scattered precipitation reduce confidence in the
northern extent of the fire weather threat. See the previous
discussion below for additional details.

..Moore.. 04/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CDT Sat Apr 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move through the southern Great Basin and
into the Southwest and Sunday. A surface low will deepen within the
Colorado Plateau and eventually in the lee of the southern Rockies.
Strong winds and dry surface conditions are expected between a
Pacific cold front in the Great Basin and a dryline in eastern New
Mexico.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
With the mid-level jet moving across northern Arizona and northern
New Mexico, surface winds of 25-35 mph are possible within these
areas. Outside of this more favorable region, surface winds of 15-25
mph are expected. Minimum RH values of 5-15% will be common. Broadly
Critical fire weather is likely across much of New Mexico into
northern Arizona. Locally extremely critical conditions are possible
in north of the Mogollon Rim into northwest New Mexico. However,
these conditions will either be brief or occur where fuel loading is
typically quite low.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Sat Apr 30 2022


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MAY 2022

The update to the May 2022 temperature and precipitation outlook is primarily
driven by dynamical model guidance at varying time scales including the short-
and medium-range. Latest information from more slowly varying boundary
conditions such as soil moisture anomalies and melting snowpack also played a
role. The organization and strength of the MJO continues to vary considerably
as it has over the last several months and current indications from
observations and model predictions of the RMM index continue to highlight the
uncertainty in more organized, long lived MJO activity and so continue lower
confidence in impacts - especially for this part of the seasonal cycle. La
Nina
conditions remain solidly in place in both the ocean and atmosphere in the
equatorial Pacific Ocean.



The changes in the updated May 2022 temperature outlook include a decrease in
coverage and probabilities for above-normal monthly mean temperatures for
areas
in the western CONUS such as California, the central Great Basin, the central
Rockies and parts of the western Southwest. Moreover, an area of favored
below-normal temperatures is introduced in the Pacific Northwest. Troughing
and
cooler temperatures are forecast to impact the western CONUS after the first
week of May and is the primary reason for this change. The rest of the updated
temperature outlook is largely unchanged from the mid-month outlook.



For precipitation, the forecast of strong troughing entering the western CONUS
during the Week-2 period (to first order), supports a considerably more wet
pattern for the northern tier of the CONUS from the Pacific Northwest to the
Great Lakes as highlighted in the updated outlook. Moreover, the favored
below-normal precipitation in the western U.S. is narrowed in the updated
outlook. Also, this anticipated pattern as well as considerable precipitation
in the short-range forecast (first few days of the month) result in an
increase
in odds for favored above-normal precipitation for parts of the central Plains
and central Mississippi Valley and so a decrease in coverage of below-normal
precipitation in this area from the previous May 2022 outlook.



The variability in dynamical model guidance and other forecast information
creates high uncertainty in the eventual monthly total precipitation amounts
for the eastern CONUS and so a large area of "Equal Chances" is forecast in
this area in the updated outlook. No changes are made to the May 2022
temperature and precipitation outlooks for Alaska. Signals remain quite weak
in
the majority of the forecast tools in this region.



*******************************************************************************

******               Previous discussion from mid-month
******

*******************************************************************************



The May 2022 temperature and precipitation outlook remains influenced to some
degree by continuing La Nina conditions, but is also impacted by favored
blocking anticipated to continue into the month of May in the northeast
Atlantic to Greenland. Predictions of both the AO and NAO indices start the
month strongly negative with reasonable spread for this time of the year. The
MJO has not been well behaved, nor coherent or long-lived over the last
several
weeks and did not play a significant role in the outlook. Other factors
included boundary conditions such as extreme drought conditions from the
Southwest to the central Rockies to the central and southern Plains. Anomalous
snow pack also was considered for the northern High Plains due to recent
strong
spring snowstorms during mid to late April.



Dynamical model guidance from the CFS along with several Week 3-4 ensemble
model predictions systems extending through the middle of the month of May
favor above-normal temperatures for much of the West especially portions of
the
Southwest and the central and southern High plains where extremely below-
normal
soil moisture further supports a warm signature for much of May. As noted
earlier, the start of May is favored to be influenced by a negative AO and NAO
pattern consistent with forecast blocking at high latitudes in the northeast
Atlantic. Troughing upstream of the blocking region favors below-normal
temperatures from the northern Plains to the Great Lakes southward to the
Tennessee Valley. Monthly mean below-normal temperatures are favored to remain
even though there is uncertainty of the eventual forecast circulation the last
2 weeks in May.



The May 2022 precipitation outlook favors below-normal monthly total
precipitation amounts from the central West coast across the central and
southern Great Basin, central and southern Rockies eastward to include most of
the central and southern Plains. Although there is considerable uncertainty in
the precipitation outlook, the anticipated ridge-trough pattern forecast for
much of the first half of the May supports ridging and drier than normal
conditions in this area. Drought conditions also in a minor way would tend to
favor less re-cycling of local moisture for needed precipitation processes in
some areas.



In vicinity and slightly downstream of favored troughing (forced by north
Atlantic blocking) makes above-normal precipitation most likely for many areas
in the eastern CONUS. Model guidance also favors above-normal precipitation
for
southern Alaska and portions of the northern High Plains.

FORECASTER: Jon Gottschalck

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Jun ... will be issued on Thu May 19 2022

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 PM EDT Sat Apr 30 2022

Valid 12Z Tue May 03 2022 - 12Z Sat May 07 2022

...Overview...

A series of systems will produce episodes of precipitation from
the Northwest U.S. and northern-central Rockies (rain and high
elevation snow) through the central-southern Plains and much of
the East. A system tracking out of the Midwest early Tuesday
onward and another one tracking out of the West should be the last
in the series during the currently established pattern consisting
of discrete troughs/closed lows, while mean troughing aloft
setting up near the West Coast late week into the weekend will
likely bring a couple frontal systems and associated precipitation
focus into the West. The most active weather should be with the
system emerging from the West by midweek with the Storm Prediction
Center indicating a threat of severe weather over the southern
Plains and vicinity and WPC showing an experimental medium range
"Slight Risk" for excessive rainfall over parts of the region as
well, with runoff issues potentially enhanced due to wet ground
from rainfall expected in the short range time frame. The midweek
threat signal is stronger than average as a closed upper
system/lead upper diffluence combine with increasing inflow of
Gulf moisture into a wavy front. Rainfall will continue spreading
into/through the East later in the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles offered significant forecast
challenges in multiple respects. Every day or so the models keep
changing the specifics of flow aloft over eastern Canada into the
eastern U.S., leading to oscillations in strength/track of low
pressure tracking out of the Midwest early Tuesday onward. Latest
clustering suggests somewhat less interaction between Canada
troughing and the Midwest shortwave, generally yielding a
weaker/southward surface low and then by early Thursday a wave
offshore from the Northeast. Meanwhile the pronounced spread
continues for the upper low tracking out of the West, with the
GFS/GEFS mean on the fast side and the ECMWF slowest. From
Thursday onward the 00Z ECMWF mean and CMC/CMC mean offered a
compromise closest to what has historically been the best starting
point in this type of timing discrepancy, especially involving a
closed low, which is a two-thirds lean toward the slower side of
the envelope. General preferences ultimately leaned closest to the
00Z CMC/CMC mean and ECMWF mean. With the mean trough settling
near the West Coast, there is a general theme of a leading
shortwave reaching the coast Thursday and then another feature
arriving around Saturday. However models/ensembles have varied
wildly for amplitude of the leading shortwave. Some GFS runs/GEFS
ensembles have been quite amplified while ECMWF runs/ECMWF
ensembles have been trending noticeably flatter (with the CMC/CMC
mean a compromise). Compared to the very amplified 00Z run, the
06Z and then 12Z GFS runs have made a pronounced flatter trend
closer to the consensus.

Guidance preferences led to starting with a 06Z/00Z operational
model composite for the first half of the period, employing
slightly less than typical weight of the GFS component. Then the
forecast transitioned to a model/ensemble mean blend including
more CMC than ECMWF along with remaining input consisting of the
00Z ECMWF/CMC means and 06Z GEFS mean. New 12Z model trends
(including a faster adjustment in the ECMWF) remain supportive of
slower timing than the GFS for the system emerging from the West,
but faster than the 00Z ECMWF.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, the upper low forecast to track from near southern
Idaho through the central Rockies Tuesday-Wednesday and associated
surface reflection will spread rain and higher elevation snow
across the northern-central Rockies and High Plains during that
time. This system could produce some locally enhanced totals
depending on exact details. Then an amplified upper trough and
surface frontal system forecast to reach the West Coast and
progress inland next Thursday-Saturday should bring a renewed
precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther
eastward. The southern extent of precipitation will depend on the
upper trough's precise amplitude which has been quite uncertain so
far, but latest trend suggest that most moisture should be
confined to the northern half of the West. The upper
dynamics/surface front could reach far enough east to start
producing at least scattered rainfall over the northern High
Plains by next weekend. The Pacific Northwest may see additional
precipitation by next Saturday with another front.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the initial rainfall focus will be
with a system tracking out of the Midwest early Tuesday onward.
This low and associated fronts should produce the highest totals
over the lower Great Lakes and Ohio Valley with somewhat lighter
amounts extending eastward through the East Coast. The next system
in the series will likely emerge over the Plains during the day
Wednesday and lead to another episode of potentially heavy
rainfall, with the WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
showing a Slight Risk over/near parts of the south-central Plains
for Wednesday into early Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center is
also monitoring severe threats over and just east of the southern
Plains Wednesday-Thursday. Rain should continue pushing eastward
from the Plains through the rest of the week with some pockets of
moderate to heavy amounts. System details by late in the week are
still fairly uncertain but currently the most likely axis of
highest rainfall totals extends from the Midwest through the
Mid-Atlantic. Over the central/east-central U.S., rain that falls
prior to this final system could increase sensitivity to added
rainfall. Fortunately the guidance is consistent in keeping this
system's moisture south of the far northern Plains where soil
conditions are the wettest.

The system initially crossing the West will support highs 10-15F
below normal over the northern Rockies into Great Basin on
Tuesday. Then this system's progression will reinforce the chilly
pattern over the central Plains/Midwest (highs up to 10-15F below
normal Tuesday-Thursday) before temperatures may finally moderate
toward the end of the week. Warmer readings will cross the West
mid-late week with best potential for highs 10-15F above normal on
Wednesday-Thursday. A gradual increase of clouds/precipitation
will bring highs down to moderately below normal levels over the
Northwest Friday-Saturday. The northern two-thirds of the East
will see above normal temperatures into midweek, followed by a
gradual cooling trend that will expand coverage of near to
somewhat below normal highs late in the week.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 30 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19880502 - 19860430 - 19950413 - 19770503 - 19910506


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 7 day periods centered on the following dates:

Short Range Forecast Discussion

333 PM EDT Sat Apr 30 2022

...Severe thunderstorms are expected from parts of the Midwest
into the ArkLaTex today along with locally heavy rain/possible
flash flooding...

...Severe thunderstorms will be possible over the southern High
Plains on Sunday with flash flood potential extending eastward
into parts of northern Texas into Oklahoma through Sunday night...

...Critical Risk of fire weather for northern Arizona into western
and central New Mexico on Sunday...

Thunderstorms are likely to develop through this evening ahead a
cold front tracking eastward into the lower Ohio and lower
Mississippi Valleys. Some severe thunderstorms will be possible
from southern Wisconsin into the middle Mississippi Valley and
northeastern Texas along with localized flash flooding. Farther
east, diurnally driven thunderstorms across central and southern
Florida will be capable of very heavy rain this evening along with
a localized flash flood threat, mainly over any urban areas that
will be prone to poor drainage.

As the cold front continues eastward on Sunday, rain and
thunderstorms will spread eastward into the Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic and southeastern U.S., but the threat for severe
thunderstorms and flash flooding will be more localized when
compared to today's threat. However, the portion of the front over
Texas will lift northward as a warm front during the day on
Sunday, with a dryline extending southward through eastern New
Mexico into western Texas from a surface low lifting north. A
return of moisture along with favorable upper level dynamics has
prompted the Storm Prediction Center to issue an Enhanced Risk for
severe thunderstorms over the Texas Panhandle, eastern New Mexico
into portions of the Permian Basin. Threats of tornadoes, large
hail and damaging straight line winds will exist along with an
evolving threat for flash flooding as storms track eastward Sunday
night. West of the dryline, conditions will be highly favorable
for the spreading of wildfires as winds of 25 to 35 mph combine
with low relative humidities over northern portions of Arizona
into much of New Mexico with a reduced risk over the remainder of
Arizona into portions of southern Nevada, Utah and Colorado. The
storm system will move eastward on Monday, spreading rain through
the Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley along with some
light snow accumulations for portions of western Nebraska.

A storm system is forecast to continue moving inland from the
Northwest tonight, spreading rain and higher elevation snow across
the Intermountain region of the western U.S. through Sunday,
however precipitation totals are not expected to be very high.
Sunday night, a somewhat stronger system is expected to reach the
Pacific Northwest which will usher in a cold front along with
light to moderate rain for the Pacific Northwest and snow into the
Cascades and some of the higher terrain of eastern Oregon into
central Idaho.

0125 AM CDT Sun May 01 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will move through the Great Basin and into
the Southwest today. At the surface, a dryline will set up in
eastern New Mexico with a Pacific cold front moving through the
Great Basin. Fire weather concerns will be focused between these
boundaries.

...Southwest and southern/eastern Great Basin...
Regional soundings from Saturday evening show very dry air at low
levels. With poor overnight RH recovery expected, Elevated to
Critical conditions will likely being relatively early in the day.
Strong winds will develop in response to the deepening surface low
in the Colorado Plateau as well as increasing mid-level winds. RH by
afternoon will generally fall to 5-15%, with some locations seeing
closer to 20%. The strongest winds will occur north of the Mogollon
Rim into eastern Utah and western Colorado due to their position
beneath the mid-level jet. Here, 25-35 mph winds with higher gusts
are expected. Extremely Critical meteorological conditions are
possible north of the Rim, though low fuel loading should mitigate
large fire potential. Winds of 20-25 mph are probable into much of
New Mexico. Farther south and west, winds are generally expected to
be lighter at 15-20 mph, though briefly Critical conditions may
still occur.

The primary uncertainty in this forecast will be how far east fire
weather concerns will extend onto the plains of eastern New Mexico.
Dryline position varies within guidance. Given this uncertainty, no
adjustments will be made to highlights. However, these highlights
may need to be adjusted westward as the dryline position becomes
more observationally clear.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0127 AM CDT Sun May 01 2022

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
On Monday, the Southwest and southern High Plains will be in between
shortwave troughs. Mid-level winds will be relaxed to some degree.
However, a strong surface low is expected to develop in eastern
Colorado and migrate southeastward during the day. This feature
should drive strong surface winds across New Mexico. Farther west,
the next shortwave trough will move into the Great Basin. A surface
trough in Utah will also aid in strong surface winds impacting
southern Nevada.

...New Mexico and adjacent southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather is most likely to occur across parts of New
Mexico. Winds of 20-25 mph will coincide with 5-15% RH during the
afternoon. Critical meteorological conditions will probably extend
into the Texas Panhandle/South Plains as well. However, these areas
are expected to receive precipitation on Sunday. Given this
uncertainty, Critical highlights will be withheld in these areas.
Another uncertainty is the southward progression of a cold front in
the High Plains. This may limit the duration of fire weather
concerns as well.

...Southern Nevada...
Area fuels have become critically dry recently. Strong
southerly/southwesterly winds are probable during the afternoon as
the surface trough deepens in Utah. Mid-level winds will also be
strengthened as the trough approaches from the west. Surface winds
of 15-20 mph will overlap 15-20% RH. Elevated fire weather
conditions are expected.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progresion of a closed upper/low
tracking out of the West into the Plains and eastward, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the best
clustered and slower 12/00 UTC solutions of the
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean. Have leaned on the
slower side of the forecast envelope given nature of a separated
southern stream flow with embedded closed systems. This guidance
combination also seems to work well for much of the rest of the
lower 48 over medium range time scales. With the mean trough
settling near the West Coast, there is a general theme of a
leading shortwave reaching the coast Thursday and then another
feature arriving around Saturday. While recent models/ensembles
have varied wildly for later week/weekend amplitude, latest
guidance is converging on a more commom scenario.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Threat Highlights...

An active spring pattern continues across much of the lower 48
states this week. A lead moderate rainfall focus will be with a
system working into the Northeast Wednesday, with cooling
post-frontal Canadian high pressure settling in the wake of the
main low. Meanwhile, a closed upper low/trough low forecast to
track through the central Rockies midweek and associated surface
system development will spread rain and higher elevation snow
across the northern-central Rockies and High Plains. This system
could produce some locally terrain enhanced totals. This system
will then emerge over the Plains and present potentially heavy
rainfall, with the WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
still showing a Slight Risk over/near parts of the south-central
Plains Wednesday into Thursday. The threat signal is stronger than
average as the southern stream closed upper system and upper
diffluence/instability combine with increasing inflow of Gulf
moisture into a wavy front. The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring severe threats for this area Wednesday-Thursday.
Organized rain should translate generally eastward through the
rest of the week with low/frontal system progression that will
focus some widespread moderate to heavy amounts. The most likely
axis of highest rainfall totals extends from the mid-lower MS and
OH Valleys through the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic given
expected upper low/trough and surface system track and trailing
cold front.

Upstream, a moderately amplified upper trough and surface frontal
system forecast to reach the West Coast and progress inland next
Thursday into next weekend should bring a renewed precipitation
focus into the Pacific Northwest and then farther eastward. The
southern extent of precipitation will depend on the upper trough's
precise amplitude which has been quite uncertain recently in
guidance, but latest trends suggest that most moisture should be
confined to the northern half of the West. The upper
dynamics/surface front could reach far enough east to start
producing at least scattered rainfall over the northern High
Plains by next weekend. Expect renewed potential again by next
weekend to progress into and across the West with another frontal
surge as unsettling upper trough energies earnestly dig into the
region.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progresion of a closed upper/low
tracking out of the West into the Plains and eastward, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the best
clustered and slower 12/00 UTC solutions of the
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean. Have leaned on the
slower side of the forecast envelope given nature of a separated
southern stream flow with embedded closed systems. This guidance
combination also seems to work well for much of the rest of the
lower 48 over medium range time scales. With the mean trough
settling near the West Coast, there is a general theme of a
leading shortwave reaching the coast Thursday and then another
feature arriving around Saturday. While recent models/ensembles
have varied wildly for later week/weekend amplitude, latest
guidance is converging on a more commom scenario.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Threat Highlights...

An active spring pattern continues across much of the lower 48
states this week. A lead moderate rainfall focus will be with a
system working into the Northeast Wednesday, with cooling
post-frontal Canadian high pressure settling in the wake of the
main low. Meanwhile, a closed upper low/trough low forecast to
track through the central Rockies midweek and associated surface
system development will spread rain and higher elevation snow
across the northern-central Rockies and High Plains. This system
could produce some locally terrain enhanced totals. This system
will then emerge over the Plains and present potentially heavy
rainfall, with the WPC experimental Excessive Rainfall Outlook
still showing a Slight Risk over/near parts of the south-central
Plains Wednesday into Thursday. The threat signal is stronger than
average as the southern stream closed upper system and upper
diffluence/instability combine with increasing inflow of Gulf
moisture into a wavy front. The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring severe threats for this area Wednesday-Thursday.
Organized rain should translate generally eastward through the
rest of the week with low/frontal system progression that will
focus some widespread moderate to heavy amounts. The most likely

cold front.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for portions of
the Eastern Ohio Valleys, Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic
through Monday morning...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms for portions

Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over portions of
Southern Plains and Central Appalachians through Monday morning; a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley from
Monday into Tuesday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southwest/Southern Rockies on Sunday and Monday...

On Sunday, a strong storm over the Upper Mississippi Valley will
slowly move northeastward to James Bay, Canada, by Monday evening.
The associated front will move from the Great Lake/Central Gulf
Coast to off most of the East Coast by Monday evening. The
associated front will destabilize the atmosphere producing showers
and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes to the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Sunday. Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of Eastern Ohio
Valleys, Central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic through Monday
morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
few tornadoes.

In addition, moderate to heavy rain will develop over parts of the
Central Appalachians. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over the area through Monday morning.
The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

Moreover, on Sunday, upper-level energy and a second front will
move out of the Central Rockies onto the Southern Plains. On
Sunday morning, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will move
northwestward over the Southern Plains. The associated boundary
and moisture will aid in destabilizing the atmosphere producing
showers and thunderstorms from the Central High Plains to the
Southern Plains starting in the afternoon and going overnight into
Monday morning. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of Southern High Plains through
Monday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. In addition, there is an increased risk of large
hail, two inches or greater over the area.

Furthermore, the moderate to heavy rain associated with the
thunderstorm will cause excessive rainfall. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southern Plains through Monday morning. The associated heavy rain
will create localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas
that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

On Monday, the system continues to move eastward over the
Central/Southern Plains into the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
by Tuesday. The showers and thunderstorms will also move into the
region as the moisture and the boundary continues to destabilize
the atmosphere. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern Plains on
Monday into Tuesday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. However, there is an increased
risk for EF2 to EF5 tornadoes, large hail, two inches or greater
over the area on Monday into Tuesday morning.

In addition, the threat of excessive rainfall increases parts of
the Central/Southern Plains from Monday into Tuesday morning.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over parts of Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley from Monday into Tuesday morning. The associated heavy rain
will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban
areas, roads, and small streams being the most vulnerable.

Meanwhile, by Sunday evening, upper-level energy and associated
front will move over the Northern Intermountain Region/Great Basin
into the Central Rockies. The energy will aid in producing rain
and highest elevation snow over the region through early Monday
morning. Overnight Sunday, another front will move onshore over
the Pacific Northwest, moving inland to the Central
Rockies/Southwest by Tuesday. The system will produce coastal rain
and highest elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest early Monday
morning, moving into parts of the Northern Rockies and Great Basin
by Tuesday morning.

Furthermore, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather
over the Southwest and Southern Rockies on Sunday. The Fire
weather threat is due to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low relative
humidity. On Monday, the threat of fire weather continues over
parts of the Southern Rockies.

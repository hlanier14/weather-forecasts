.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Fri Mar 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move across the Southwest today,
resulting in weak surface low development over southeast CO this
afternoon. Relatively strong low/midlevel southwesterly flow will
develop in advance of the upper trough, resulting in an increase in
the fire weather threat over portions of southeast AZ, southern NM
and west TX.

...Southeast AZ...Southern NM...West TX...
Elevated to potentially critical meteorological conditions will
develop this afternoon, as sustained surface winds increase to 15-25
mph in conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20%. These
conditions may develop as far north as portions of the TX Panhandle
and TX South Plains, but generally unfavorable fuel conditions
should limit the threat in those areas. Further south from southeast
NM into far west TX, somewhat more favorable fuels in conjunction
with the expected wind/RH will support a critical fire weather
threat, with elevated conditions potentially extending as far west
as southeast AZ.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 26 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, strong surface high pressure in the wake of a large
cold front is expected to bring anomalous cold, potentially impacting
vulnerable vegetation over parts of the southeastern U.S. Mid-level and
surface
low pressure development and possible high winds are favored across portions
of
western and central contiguous U.S. Mid-level low pressure forecast over
Alaska
favors below-normal temperatures and above-normal precipitation across much of
the state during the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures over portions of the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and the
Southeast, Sat-Sun, Apr 3-4.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies,
and the High Plains, Sun-Thu, Apr 4-8.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 29 - FRIDAY APRIL 02:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!r8eeIOU5oOIC1UqI4psFAPNxJjFGswiHRNhrEH6TKLhGDQmFMWC76K8_d9GLCx6c5YtJoCQW$

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 03 - FRIDAY APRIL 09: During early week-2, there continues
to be fair agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means regarding the
500-hPa height pattern over North America. Both models show the development of
anomalous troughing over the western CONUS, with the GEFS favoring a more
amplified mean solution over the eastern Pacific, with the troughing extending
further south compared to the ECMWF. Downstream, both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles continue to advertise a full latitude ridge with large positive
height departures over the Davis Strait extending southward and overspreading
much of the CONUS. Following the passage of a mid-level shortwave trough and a
large frontal system late in week-1, anomalous troughing is favored to linger
over portions of the northeastern CONUS and western Atlantic. Overall, the
mid-level height pattern appears less transient compared to previous guidance,
and models suggest a gradual deamplification of these mid-level features
during
the latter portion of the week-2 period.



At the start of week-2, a broad area of surface high pressure and anomalous
cold air is forecast to settle over the eastern CONUS in the wake of a large
frontal system. Some of the largest negative temperature departures in the
GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles are favored occur prior to week-2. Reforecast tools,
however, maintain elevated chances of minimum temperatures falling below the
15th percentile and below freezing as far south as the Tennessee Valley,
Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast. Frost and freezing temperatures are
possible, which may impact vulnerable spring vegetation emerging in the
region.
Therefore, a slight risk for much below temperatures is posted for Apr 3 to 4.
As surface high pressure is anticipated to weaken, temperatures are expected
to
moderate through the remainder of the outlook period. Drier than normal
conditions remain likely for many regions east of the Mississippi.



Across the western CONUS, the development of the aforementioned anomalous
troughing is favored to bring anomalous cold temperatures to portions of the
Pacific Northwest and California during week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools continue to indicate increasing chances for minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile by day 10 (Apr 5). However,
elevated probabilities for subfreezing temperatures remain limited to the
higher elevations of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada ranges, and no temperature
related hazards are issued at this time. As the mid-level trough axis is
predicted to shift further inland, ensemble guidance favors development of
surface low pressure across the West into the High Plains. Increasing surface
pressure gradients are possible with this pattern and reforecast tools
continue
to show some support for potentially high sustained winds over portions of the
Southwest, Great Basin, Rockies and the High Plains. Thus, a slight risk of
high winds is maintained for Apr 4 to 8.



Across the Alaska region, cyclone activity in the Bering Strait and Gulf of
Alaska is favored to bring anomalous cold and enhanced precipitation to many
parts of the state during week-2. While temperature and precipitation impacts
are expected to remain below hazard thresholds, there are growing concerns
that
the cold and wet pattern could increase snow water across the Mainland,
leading
to an increased risk of localized flooding during eventual river ice break-up
later in April.

...Pattern Evolution and Guidance Assessment/Predictability...

Models and ensembles agree that the upper level pattern over the
continental U.S. will be amplified yet generally progressive next
week, bolstering forecast confidence. A departing vigorous upper
trough and deep low/cold front off the East Coast Monday will lay
down a wavy trailing cold front over Florida and the Gulf of
Mexico/Mexico. An early-mid week southern stream impulse will then
track over the U.S. southern tier, but local convective focus
remains uncertain in the wake of the lead system. Meanwhile, the
next major northern stream storm system dig through the
Intermountain West and Rockies early next week, and this storm
system works across the central and eastern U.S. to induce lead
return flow, reaching the East Coast into next Thursday/Friday. A
large surface high then spreads over much of the lower 48
mid-later next week.

Model and ensemble guidance is clustered much better than normal
in a pattern with overall above normal predictability days 3-7.
Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, the 00 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models days
3-5 (Mon-Wed). Opted to only add modest inputs from the compatible
06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean days 7/8
considering slowly growing forecast spread. This plan along with
manual edits provides excellent WPC continuity and is in line with
newer 12 UTC guidance including the 12 UTC GFS that has trended
more in line with the other models in the less certain southern
stream days 3-5.

...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

The strong East Coast storm system will be exiting the Northeast
Monday morning, with strong and gusty winds and colder weather in
its wake, and some snow showers for northern New England. The next
system crosses the Intermountain West with a strong surface low
trekking across southern Canada for the beginning of the week.
This will bring another round of rain and mountain snow to the
central and northern Rockies through Tuesday. As the cold front
reaches the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should advect
enough Gulf moisture northward to produce showers and storms from
Texas to the Deep South, and locally heavy rainfall is possible
across the Appalachians by next midweek, although models differ on
the axis of heaviest rainfall. Strong winds are also expected
across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday owing
to the strong pressure gradient that will be in place.

Temperatures are expected to be well above average ahead of the
cold front advancing across the Plains, especially on Monday when
highs could be pushing 70 degrees as far north as the Canadian
border. An abrupt return to reality ensues by the middle of the
week as a much colder airmass advects into the region behind the
front, with readings about 5-15+ degrees below average that could
flirt with some local record values.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri March 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 01 - 05 2021

Todays model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. Shortwave troughing is predicted to move
through the eastern CONUS. Otherwise, broad ridging is favored to develop over
the CONUS. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean
slightly greater than the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent
model
skill. The resultant manual blend features negative 500-hPa height anomalies
across parts of the Northeast, and positive height anomalies elsewhere across
the CONUS. Anomalous ridging is forecast across much of the central and
eastern
Pacific, with a series of shortwave troughs predicted to track to the north of
this feature across Alaska. This intermittent troughing favors near to below
normal heights for most of the Mainland. Above normal heights are forecast
over
the Aleutians and parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska.

Probabilities for above normal temperatures are higher across the Northern and
Central Plains, Upper Mississippi and Middle Valley, and for much of the
western CONUS, while near to below normal temperature probabilities are
forecast over most of the eastern CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tools. Below normal temperature
probabilities are increased across much of Alaska, given the potential for
shortwave troughing to lower heights across the state, as well as decreased
solar heating across the southern part of Alaska and the Panhandle. These
elevated below normal temperature probabilities also extend into parts of the
Pacific Northwest. Above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of above
normal temperatures over western Aleutians.

Due to limited synoptic forcing, near to below normal precipitation is favored
across most of the CONUS except for northern Maine, where above normal
precipitation is forecast, supported by the operational autoblend and ERF
consolidation tool. Troughing over Alaska and increased westerlies result in
above normal precipitation chances across most of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 03 - 09 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous ridging with above normal 500-hPa heights is forecast across the
central and eastern CONUS, while a trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is
predicted over the West Coast. Negative height anomalies are forecast over
much
of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle underneath troughing. Positive height
anomalies remain forecast for the Aleutians.

A predicted trough with below normal 500-hPa heights increases chances of
below
normal temperatures over the West Coast. Near to above normal temperatures are
favored across the rest of the CONUS except for Florida where below normal
temperatures are forecast, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast
tool.
Increased troughing across Alaska and associated north to northwesterly
mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the state, while above normal temperature probabilities are forecast
over the western Aleutians, under above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across most of
the CONUS, under the broad ridging forecast over the central and western
CONUS.
The exception is over parts of the Northern Plains and the Upper Mississippi
Valley, where above normal precipitation is indicated. Troughing over Alaska
and a series of surface lows forecast to track in the vicinity of the state
result in elevated above normal precipitation chances.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

Expanded the elevated area slightly southeast based on the latest
forecast guidance. Otherwise, the forecast appears on track with 15
to 20 mph winds in an area with relative humidity of 10 to 20
percent.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Fri Mar 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move from the Southwest into the
Southern Plains on Saturday. A weak surface low is forecast to move
across TX as an attendant cold front moves through portions of the
southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Southeast NM into West TX...
Relatively strong westerly winds are expected to develop Saturday
afternoon from southeast NM into west TX, in advance of the cold
frontal passage. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher) in
conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20% will result in a threat
of elevated fire weather conditions. Some uncertainty remains
regarding the timing of the cold front, which will impact the
location and duration of any critical potential.

...Pattern Evolution and Guidance Assessment/Predictability...

Models and ensembles agree that the upper level pattern over the
continental U.S. will be amplified yet generally progressive next
week, bolstering forecast confidence. A departing vigorous upper
trough and deep low/cold front off the East Coast Monday will lay
down a wavy trailing cold front over Florida and the Gulf of
Mexico/Mexico. An early-mid week southern stream impulse will then
track over the U.S. southern tier, but local convective focus
remains uncertain in the wake of the lead system. Meanwhile, the
next major northern stream storm system dig through the
Intermountain West and Rockies early next week, and this storm
system works across the central and eastern U.S. to induce lead
return flow, reaching the East Coast into next Thursday/Friday. A
large surface high then spreads over much of the lower 48
mid-later next week.

Model and ensemble guidance is clustered much better than normal
in a pattern with overall above normal predictability days 3-7.
Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, the 00 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models days
3-5 (Mon-Wed). Opted to only add modest inputs from the compatible
06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean days 7/8
considering slowly growing forecast spread. This plan along with
manual edits provides excellent WPC continuity and is in line with
newer 12 UTC guidance including the 12 UTC GFS that has trended
more in line with the other models in the less certain southern
stream days 3-5.

...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

The strong East Coast storm system will be exiting the Northeast
Monday morning, with strong and gusty winds and colder weather in
its wake, and some snow showers for northern New England. The next
system crosses the Intermountain West with a strong surface low
trekking across southern Canada for the beginning of the week.
This will bring another round of rain and mountain snow to the
central and northern Rockies through Tuesday. As the cold front
reaches the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should advect
enough Gulf moisture northward to produce showers and storms from
Texas to the Deep South, and locally heavy rainfall is possible
across the Appalachians by next midweek, although models differ on
the axis of heaviest rainfall. Strong winds are also expected
across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday owing
to the strong pressure gradient that will be in place.

Temperatures are expected to be well above average ahead of the
cold front advancing across the Plains, especially on Monday when
highs could be pushing 70 degrees as far north as the Canadian
border. An abrupt return to reality ensues by the middle of the
week as a much colder airmass advects into the region behind the
front, with readings about 5-15+ degrees below average that could
flirt with some local record values.

...Pattern Evolution and Guidance Assessment/Predictability...

Models and ensembles agree that the upper level pattern over the
continental U.S. will be amplified yet generally progressive next
week, bolstering forecast confidence. A departing vigorous upper
trough and deep low/cold front off the East Coast Monday will lay
down a wavy trailing cold front over Florida and the Gulf of
Mexico/Mexico. An early-mid week southern stream impulse will then
track over the U.S. southern tier, but local convective focus
remains uncertain in the wake of the lead system. Meanwhile, the
next major northern stream storm system dig through the
Intermountain West and Rockies early next week, and this storm
system works across the central and eastern U.S. to induce lead
return flow, reaching the East Coast into next Thursday/Friday. A
large surface high then spreads over much of the lower 48
mid-later next week.

Model and ensemble guidance is clustered much better than normal
in a pattern with overall above normal predictability days 3-7.
Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of the 06 UTC GFS, the 00 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET and the 13 UTC National Blend of Models days
3-5 (Mon-Wed). Opted to only add modest inputs from the compatible
06 UTC GEFS mean and 00 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean days 7/8
considering slowly growing forecast spread. This plan along with
manual edits provides excellent WPC continuity and is in line with
newer 12 UTC guidance including the 12 UTC GFS that has trended
more in line with the other models in the less certain southern
stream days 3-5.

...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

The strong East Coast storm system will be exiting the Northeast
Monday morning, with strong and gusty winds and colder weather in
its wake, and some snow showers for northern New England. The next
system crosses the Intermountain West with a strong surface low
trekking across southern Canada for the beginning of the week.
This will bring another round of rain and mountain snow to the
central and northern Rockies through Tuesday. As the cold front
reaches the Central U.S. by Monday/Tuesday, it should advect
enough Gulf moisture northward to produce showers and storms from
Texas to the Deep South, and locally heavy rainfall is possible
across the Appalachians by next midweek, although models differ on
the axis of heaviest rainfall. Strong winds are also expected
across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday owing
to the strong pressure gradient that will be in place.

Temperatures are expected to be well above average ahead of the
cold front advancing across the Plains, especially on Monday when

border. An abrupt return to reality ensues by the middle of the

...There is an embedded Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
upstate New York and Northern New England through Saturday
morning...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Tennessee Valley from Saturday into Sunday morning...

A front along the East Coast will move off the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic Coast overnight Friday while extending westward
across the Southeast and the Gulf Coast State.  The boundary
returns northward as a warm front as the next storm moves out of
the Plains.  The front will help produce showers and thunderstorms
over parts of the Northeast on Friday evening, while areas of
light snow will develop over parts of upstate New York and
Northern New England through Saturday morning.  The SPC has issued
a Sight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of upstate New
York and Northern New England through Saturday morning. The
hazards associated with the thunderstorms are the possibility of
low-top convection, frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gust, and a tornado or two.  Additionally, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the southern
Mid-Atlantic, the Southeast, and the Central Gulf Coast on Friday
evening. The showers and thunderstorms will continue over the
southern Mid-Atlantic and the Central Gulf Coast while developing
over parts of the Tennessee Valley overnight Friday into Saturday
afternoon.

Meanwhile, a developing area of low pressure over the Central
Plains will advance to the Middle Mississippi Valley by Saturday
afternoon.  The storm will move into Southeastern Canada on
Sunday, while the associated front moves from the Middle
Mississippi Valley/Southern Plains to the East Coast by Sunday
evening.  The system will produce rain and scattered thunderstorms
over parts of the Central Plains on Friday evening.  Associated
upper-level energy will produce light snow over parts of the
Rockies into the Southwest that will end overnight Friday.  As the
system moves into the Middle Mississippi Valley, the rain will
develop over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley. In contrast,
rain and snow develop over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley
on Saturday morning.  By Saturday evening, showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front over parts
of the Ohio, Lower Mississippi, and Tennessee Valleys. The SPC has
issued a Slight Risk with an embedded Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the region from Saturday morning to
Sunday morning.  The main hazards of severe thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and
tornadoes.  SPC thinks there will be a 10% or greater probability
of EF2-EF5 tornadoes and two-inch hail in the enhanced region.

Furthermore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Tennessee Valley from Saturday into
Sunday morning.  The heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms
may produce scattered areas of flash flooding; with the most
vulnerable areas are urban areas, roads, and small streams on
Saturday.  On Sunday, the showers and thunderstorms will move into
parts of the Central/Southern Appalachians and the southern
Mid-Atlantic.  The rain will also develop over parts of the
Northeast, with the rain changing over to snow on the
precipitation shield's backside before ending.

Elsewhere, a front will move onshore over the Northwest on Sunday,
moving to the Northern Intermountain Region by Sunday evening.
The system will produce rain and higher elevation snow on Sunday
over parts of the Pacific Northwest.

...Overall Weather Pattern...

The overall mid-upper level pattern across the continental U.S. is
expected to be rather amplified next week.  An upper ridge will
briefly build across the eastern U.S. with an embedded southern
stream disturbance tracking across the southeastern U.S. through
Wednesday.  Meanwhile, the next major storm system will be in
place over the Rockies and Intermountain West to begin the week,
and this storm system will steadily cross the central and eastern
U.S., reaching the East Coast around Thursday morning.  A large
surface high should settle in across the Midwest and the
east-central U.S. for the end of the week.


...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The deterministic model guidance indicates above average agreement
on the main synoptic scale features through about Thursday
evening.  The 00Z CMC becomes less amplified with the next storm
system approaching the Pacific Northwest for the end of the week,
and it's farther west with the downstream upper ridge axis across
the north-central Plains, so more focus was applied to the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET solutions through Friday, and some more of the
ensemble means for next Saturday.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

The next system crosses the Plains with a strong surface low
trekking across southern Canada for the beginning to middle of the
week.  This should advect enough Gulf moisture northward to
produce showers and storms from the central Gulf Coast to the
Northeast, and locally heavy rainfall is possible across the
Appalachians by midweek, although models differ on the axis of
heaviest rainfall. Strong winds are also expected across the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest on Tuesday owing to the strong
pressure gradient that will be in place.

Temperatures are expected to be above average ahead of the cold
front advancing across the Midwest, with readings of 5-15 degrees
above average across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley on Tuesday.
An abrupt return to reality ensues by the middle of the week for
the northern Plains and Upper Midwest as a much colder airmass
advects into the region behind the front, with readings about
5-15+ degrees below average.  This will also hold true for the
East Coast by Thursday and Friday.  Spring-like warm returns to
much of the Plains for next weekend.

Southern Plains today. A weak surface low is forecast to move across
TX as a cold front moves through portions of the southern Rockies
and High Plains.

...Southeast NM into West TX...
Relatively strong westerly winds are expected to develop this
afternoon from extreme southeast NM into west TX, in advance of the
cold frontal passage. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph (locally higher)
in conjunction with minimum RH values of 10-20% will result in a
threat of elevated fire weather conditions, with locally critical
conditions possible. The threat across the northern portion of the
Elevated area may end relatively early as the cold front moves
through.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL/EASTERN MT
INTO WESTERN ND/NORTHWEST SD...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move eastward and amplify over the
Northwest and northern Rockies on Sunday, as the downstream upper
trough moves quickly eastward to the Eastern seaboard by Monday
morning. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the lee of the
Canadian Rockies and begin moving eastward across the Canadian
Prairies by Sunday evening.

...Montana into the western Dakotas...
Strengthening westerly flow will spread across most of MT into the
western Dakotas on Sunday, in advance of the approaching upper
trough and to the south of the deepening surface cyclone, with
sustained winds of 15-25 mph (with higher gusts) expected by
afternoon. Guidance shows the typical spread with respect to the
magnitude of mixing/drying within this regime, but generally agrees
that RH values will fall into the 15-30% range as temperatures
increase into the 60s F. These conditions will result in relatively
large area of elevated fire weather conditions. Within this area,
critical conditions will be possible. A critical delineation has
been included where confidence is currently highest in meeting
wind/RH criteria, though some expansion of this area is certainly
possible in subsequent outlooks.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding likely from southern
Arkansas to Middle Tennessee today...

...Severe weather threat shifts east into the Mid-Atlantic on
Sunday...

...Strong cold front to bring gusty winds and heavy mountain snow
across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies beginning Sunday
afternoon...

Active spring weather is set to continue this weekend with more
chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding. Starting with
today, severe weather and heavy rain is likely from southern
Arkansas to Middle Tennessee. An approaching cold front combined
with a lifting warm front out of the Gulf Coast States will spark
showers and thunderstorms from the Lower Mississippi to Tennessee
valleys this morning and last throughout much of the day. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
weather that includes southern Arkansas, northern Mississippi and
Alabama, as well as western and middle Tennessee. A few storms
could turn severe as far north as central Illinois. Damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and tornadoes are all possible across the area
today. Multiple downpours will also lead to the likelihood of
flash flooding across similar areas. Rainfall totals of 1 to 3
inches, combined with saturated soils, could lead to rapid rises
in rivers and streams throughout parts of the Mid-South and
Tennessee Valley. Flash Flood Watches have been issued for much of
Tennessee and northern Alabama. WPC has also issued a Moderate
Risk of Excessive Rainfall from southeast Arkansas to Middle
Tennessee.

By Sunday, a low pressure system is forecast to strengthen across
southeast Canada with a trailing cold front set to swing across
the eastern United States. Rain is likely to accompany the cold
front up and down the East Coast, with a few inches of snow found
across northern Maine. Thunderstorms could turn severe along the
front across the Mid-Atlantic. SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms on Sunday from northern Georgia to Maryland.
Behind the cold front, chilly temperatures and gusty winds will
enter the region Sunday night.

Meanwhile, this weekend will start out quite tranquil across the
Northwest and Northern Rockies before a potent storm system enters
on Sunday. A strong cold front associated with a deepening area of
low pressure in south-central Canada will bring the threat of
damaging wind gusts and heavy mountain snow. Snowfall amounts are
expected to exceed one foot across the Cascade Mountains in
Washington. Winter Storm Watches and Winter Weather Advisories
have been posted. The most widespread hazard beginning Sunday will
be from gusty winds that extend from the Pacific Northwest through
the northern Great Basin/Rockies and into the northern High
Plains. High Wind Watches have been issued due to potential for
wind gusts to top 60 mph. This could lead to downed trees and
power lines, as well as difficult travel for high profile vehicles.

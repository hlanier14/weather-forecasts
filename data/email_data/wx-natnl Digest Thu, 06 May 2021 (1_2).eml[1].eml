No changes to the ongoing forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0116 AM CDT Wed May 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid-level flow pattern is forecast across the CONUS
through the Day1 forecast period. A broad cyclonic trough is
forecast to be centered over the Ohio Valley while a ridge of high
pressure builds across the Intermountain West. At the surface, a
cold front will slowly make its way off the eastern coast of the US
while a large are of high pressure is expected to remain stationary
across the central Rockies/Plains. With mid-level synoptic flow
displaced from much of the warmer and drier conditions across the
CONUS, little overlap of fire weather conditions is expected.
Localized gusty downslope winds across northern New Mexico may
support locally elevated fire weather potential this afternoon and
evening. However, above average fuel moisture from recent
precipitation should limit the threat.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 05 2021

SYNOPSIS: A lingering front and abundant low-level moisture maintain a risk=
 of
locally heavy rainfall across the lower Mississippi Valley, western Gulf
Coast,
and lower Rio Grande Valley through the early part of week-2. After this ti=
me,
it becomes more uncertain where and when the potential for heavy rainfall
exists across the central U.S. Later in week-2, the storm track is expected=
 to
shift northward to a more typical position for mid-May. No temperature haza=
rds
are designated, although above normal temperatures are favored for much of =
the
western U.S. and the Florida Peninsula. Periods of enhanced onshore flow ar=
e
forecast to affect southwestern Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for the Lower Mississippi Valley, western Gulf
Coast,
and Lower Rio Grande Valley, Thu-Fri, May 13-14.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MAY 08 - WEDNESDAY MAY 12:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!oJ6AvE4HIGB5De9RuYNXmjJfWd6s7enD7-ebye5IXW1FXNG0sHXuflwDFXzie=
RbiQDGV5R-p$

FOR THURSDAY MAY 13 - WEDNESDAY MAY 19: A predicted stationary front couple=
d
with high precipitable water values support a slight risk of heavy rain (mo=
re
than 1 inch per 24 hours) from the Lower Mississippi Valley west to the low=
er
Rio Grande Valley on May 13 and 14. This slight risk of heavy rainfall is
based
primarily on daily precipitation amounts from the 0Z Canadian and 0Z ECMWF
ensemble means and good continuity from those model solutions. Beyond May 1=
4,
the front is forecast to dissipate with more isolated diurnal convection
affecting the Gulf Coast. The continued wet pattern into the second week of
May
is likely to further reduce drought coverage across the eastern half of Tex=
as.
However, any locally heavy rain could trigger flash flooding in southeast
Texas
and Louisiana where recent heavy rainfall has led to saturated soils.



The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z GFS ensemble members depict a low amplitude flow patter=
n
during week-2 which corresponds to a lower risk of large scale hazards for
this
time of year. Although model guidance is beginning to feature a pattern
favorable for mesoscale convective systems as shortwave troughs progress
eastward across the northern to central Great Plains and Midwest, large
uncertainty exists on when and where heavy rainfall would occur. Therefore,=
 no
other heavy rain hazards are designated at this time. If forecast confidenc=
e
increases, then a heavy rain hazard may be included in subsequent outlooks.



Above normal temperatures are favored throughout much of the western U.S. a=
nd
the Florida Peninsula during week-2, based in part on 500-hPa heights
averaging
slightly above normal. However, mid-level ridging is unlikely to be that
anomalous, and given the time of year, maximum temperatures and heat index
values are not expected to reach hazards criteria.



A longwave trough over the Bering Sea and multiple low pressure systems
slightly elevate probabilities of above normal precipitation across
southwestern Mainland Alaska. However, precipitation amounts are likely to
remain well below hazards thresholds. The ECMWF ensemble mean depicts an in=
ch
or less of total precipitation for that part of Alaska during week-2.

Valid 12Z Sat May 08 2021 - 12Z Wed May 12 2021

...Heavy rain possible for portions of the central U.S. this
weekend and early next week...

...19Z Update...

The 00Z/06Z guidance mostly maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs. Uncertainty remains over the West/Rockies early
next week with the speed of the upper trough. The 00Z
ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles were displaced a bit farther
northeast than the GFS/GEFS, resulting in a bit quicker pace
toward the Plains/Midwest of the former compared to the latter.
With continued wavering in some GEFS cycles and no clear trend,
opted to split the difference with a blended solution. Lead-in
setup still suggests a multi-day heavy rainfall pattern east of
the Plains though perhaps not in the same place each day as the
frontal zone slowly sinks toward the Gulf Coast. The previous
discussion from 07Z is below for reference.

Fracasso


...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

The amplified upper level flow pattern during the short range
period is expected to become more quasi-zonal by this weekend as
the trough over the Northeast lifts out, and the central U.S.
ridge flattens out.  At the surface, a meandering frontal boundary
with multiple waves of low pressure along it will be the main
weather maker during the medium range period across the central
and southern tier states.

Models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement going into
the weekend, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems.  The GFS is more progressive
with the surface low crossing the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
region through Monday morning, and the CMC is slower than the
model consensus.  The GFS is also stronger with the upper trough
across the western U.S.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was
based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble
means through Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means
by days 6 and 7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley, where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a stationary front and a wave of low pressure.
The potential exists for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally
higher amounts, from eastern Kansas to Kentucky.  Another zone of
heavy rain is also probable across portions of Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Tennessee for next Tuesday and Wednesday with
similar rainfall totals possible.  Some training of thunderstorms
may lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central and western High Plains, and adjacent portions of the
northern Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs
up to 20 degrees below early May averages.  This equates to
readings maxing out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those
areas, and the higher elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern
Colorado can expect some late season accumulating snow, perhaps
exceeding six inches for some of the higher ranges.  Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, although not as anomalous.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 11 - 15 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement in
regards
to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern. Troughing is predicted
over northeastern North America. The mid-level flow is forecast to become m=
ore
zonal across the western CONUS, with ridging predicted over the eastern
Pacific, extending northward through much of Alaska. Todays manual 500-hPa
height blend depicts near to above normal heights across much of the wester=
n
CONUS, with the highest positive height anomalies forecast along the Pacifi=
c
Coast. Below normal heights are favored across portions of the Central Plai=
ns,
Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, mid-Atlantic, and Northeast,
underneath the influence of the trough over eastern Canada. Near normal
heights
are forecast across remaining areas of the central CONUS through the
Southeast.
Above normal heights are depicted across much of Alaska, except over parts =
of
the western Aleutians, where near to below normal heights are favored
underneath troughing forecast over the Bering Sea.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted acros=
s
much of the CONUS east of the Rockies as a cold front is forecast to move
through prior to the forecast period. Probabilities for above normal
temperatures are increased over parts of extreme south Texas and the Florid=
a
Peninsula, where mid-level flow is predicted to be more zonal, and supporte=
d
by
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Near to above normal temperatures are
favored over the western third of the CONUS, with the highest probabilities
for
above normal temperatures forecast across Northern and Central California a=
nd
Nevada, due to increased influence from the East Pacific ridge. Near to abo=
ve
normal temperatures are favored across Alaska underneath increased ridging =
and
enhanced southerly surface and mid-level flow ahead of troughing and
associated
surface low pressure predicted over the Bering Sea.

Frontally focused precipitation is favored across parts of the south-centra=
l
and southeastern CONUS where enhanced Gulf of Mexico moisture flow could
further enhance rainfall chances. Ridging and positive height anomalies alo=
ng
the West Coast of the CONUS favor increased chances for below normal
precipitation across portions of the West. Below normal precipitation
probabilities are also elevated over parts of the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. These areas are forecast to be on the backside of the
aforementioned
cold front, more influenced by northwesterly mid-level flow and surface hig=
h
pressure. Probabilities for near to above normal precipitation are increase=
d
over most of Alaska due to troughing predicted across the Bering Sea and an
active storm track across the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by forecasts trend=
ing
toward a low amplitude pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 13 - 19 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the week-2 period is similar to
the
6-10 day period, but less amplified. Although the mean mid-level flow acros=
s
the CONUS is predicted to be predominately zonal, the ECMWF, GEFS, and
Canadian
ensembles continue to depict increased ridging and positive height anomalie=
s
across the eastern Pacific. The trough over northeastern North America is
weaker in todays models compared to yesterdays, and would result in less of
an impact on the week-2 forecast. The manual blend for the period depicts n=
ear
normal 500-hPa heights across the CONUS and near to above normal heights ov=
er
Alaska for the period as a whole, although the ridging over the East Pacifi=
c
teleconnects with troughing over the western CONUS, which may result in
occasional periods of below normal heights.

Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across much of the
eastern
third of the CONUS, supported by the consolidation forecast tool, with the
early part of the period forecast to have the highest chances for below nor=
mal
temperatures. Probabilities for near to above normal temperatures are
highlighted across the western half of the CONUS, due to increased ridging =
in
the East Pacific and enhanced Pacific flow. The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast
tools
support increased chances for above normal temperatures across the central
CONUS. However, any troughing that develops downstream of the East Pacific
ridge could bring near to below normal temperatures into the region, and
therefore, near normal temperatures are forecast over the Northern and Cent=
ral
Rockies and Plains. Probabilities for above normal temperatures also remain
elevated across Alaska underneath persistent southerly mid-level flow, and
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools are in good agreement in terms of the
week-2 precipitation forecast across the CONUS. Increased chances for near =
to
above normal precipitation remain favored for most areas from the Northern
Rockies and Great Plains, extending east to the Atlantic Coast, given the
increased Pacific flow and periodic shortwave disturbances traversing acros=
s
the central and eastern CONUS, with the highest chances closest to the Gulf=
 of
Mexico Coast due to enhanced moisture availability. Below normal precipitat=
ion
probabilities are increased over much of the western CONUS due to the
influence
from surface high pressure forecast over the East Pacific. Near to above
normal
precipitation chances continue to be increased over Alaska due to troughing
over the Bering Sea and the ridging over the eastern Pacific favoring a mor=
e
northward storm track across Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement in the dynamical models, offset by a predicted low amplitude
pattern.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Wed May 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

An elevated area was added to portions of the Red River Valley
westward into central North Dakota. Dry air will move in behind the
cold front. Forecast soundings indicate the potential for efficient
mixing of flow aloft to the surface. 15-20 mph winds are possible
with gusts perhaps up to 30 mph. Some cumulus development is also
possible which could lead to lower temperatures/higher RH in spots.
Recent, local fuels information has indicated that green up has been
limited across the area and recent light precipitation has not
impacted fine fuels significantly.

See the previous discussion below for other details.

..Wendt.. 05/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CDT Wed May 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
A progressive mid-level flow regime will continue across the CONUS
as the western US ridge is compressed and pushed east by a shortwave
trough moving onshore across California. Troughing across the
eastern US will intensify, bringing cooler than average conditions
to much of the East. At the surface, low pressure and a cold front
will move onshore and across the Great Basin while high pressure
strengthens in the Midwest.

...Great Basin...
Ahead of a shortwave trough forecast to move onshore early in the
day, gusty southerly winds are expected across portions of the Great
Basin. Increasing flow aloft should bolster surface winds to 15-20
mph through the afternoon. Warm surface temperatures in the 70s to
80s F should allow for minimum surface humidity in the 10-20% range.
Weak mid-level moisture advection ahead of the trough and associated
cold front may also support a few high-based thunderstorms later in
the day. Locally elevated fire weather conditions and isolated
lighting appear possible, but above average fuel moisture gives
little confidence on the severity and spatial coverage at this time.

...Lingering showers and thunderstorms expected across the Mid
Atlantic and Southeast this evening as a cold front continues to
push through the region...

...Unsettled weather enters the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Great Basin on Thursday...

...Unseasonably warm temperatures continue in the West as cooler
temperatures spread through the East...

After an active stretch of weather in the central and eastern
U.S., relatively quieter conditions are expected across much of
the Lower 48 through for the latter half of the week.

As an area of low pressure tracks northeast along the coast, rain
is expected to continue into the evening hours across the
Northeast.  Showers and thunderstorms are forecast to develop
along the low's trailing cold front at pushes east across the
Mid-Atlantic, while sagging south from the Southeast and Gulf
coasts this evening.  Some of the storms developing over the Mid
Atlantic region may become strong to severe, producing strong,
gusty winds.  On Thursday, shower and storms are forecast to
continue across the Florida Peninsula as the front drops slowly
south across the region.  Some of these storms may become strong
to severe as well, producing hail and strong, gusty winds.  Behind
the front, seasonable to below-normal temperatures will spread
across much of the eastern U.S. on Thursday, with average to below
average temperature continuing through Friday.

Father west, a weak upper disturbance is expected to support
shower and thunderstorm development over the central and southern
High Plains through this evening.   There is an isolated threat
for severe wind gusts and large hail with these storms.  Then on
Thursday, a system moving east across the mid Mississippi Valley
into the Ohio Valley is expected to produce showers and
thunderstorms across the region, with some potential for strong,
gusty winds and large hail along its advancing cold front.

In the West, a well-defined cold front is forecast to move into
the Northwest on Thursday.  Widespread precipitation, including
some high-elevation mixed precipitation, is expected as the system
pushes across the Northwest into the northern Rockies late
Thursday and Friday.  Ahead of the front, above normal
temperatures are forecast to continue across much of the West
through Thursday.  Much cooler temperature will spread across the
Northwest on Friday, as above normal temperatures continue across
much of the Great Basin and Southwest, while spreading east from
the Rockies into the High Plains.

Valid 12Z Sat May 08 2021 - 12Z Wed May 12 2021

...Heavy rain possible for portions of the central U.S. this
weekend and early next week...

...19Z Update...

The 00Z/06Z guidance mostly maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs. Uncertainty remains over the West/Rockies early
next week with the speed of the upper trough. The 00Z
ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles were displaced a bit farther
northeast than the GFS/GEFS, resulting in a bit quicker pace
toward the Plains/Midwest of the former compared to the latter.
With continued wavering in some GEFS cycles and no clear trend,
opted to split the difference with a blended solution. Lead-in
setup still suggests a multi-day heavy rainfall pattern east of
the Plains though perhaps not in the same place each day as the
frontal zone slowly sinks toward the Gulf Coast. The previous
discussion from 07Z is below for reference.

Fracasso


...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

The amplified upper level flow pattern during the short range
period is expected to become more quasi-zonal by this weekend as
the trough over the Northeast lifts out, and the central U.S.
ridge flattens out.  At the surface, a meandering frontal boundary
with multiple waves of low pressure along it will be the main
weather maker during the medium range period across the central
and southern tier states.

Models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement going into
the weekend, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems.  The GFS is more progressive
with the surface low crossing the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
region through Monday morning, and the CMC is slower than the
model consensus.  The GFS is also stronger with the upper trough
across the western U.S.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was
based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble
means through Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means
by days 6 and 7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley, where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a stationary front and a wave of low pressure.
The potential exists for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally
higher amounts, from eastern Kansas to Kentucky.  Another zone of
heavy rain is also probable across portions of Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Tennessee for next Tuesday and Wednesday with
similar rainfall totals possible.  Some training of thunderstorms
may lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central and western High Plains, and adjacent portions of the
northern Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs
up to 20 degrees below early May averages.  This equates to
readings maxing out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those
areas, and the higher elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern
Colorado can expect some late season accumulating snow, perhaps
exceeding six inches for some of the higher ranges.  Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, although not as anomalous.

...Heavy rain possible for portions of the central U.S. this
weekend and early next week...

...19Z Update...

The 00Z/06Z guidance mostly maintained good continuity from the
overnight progs. Uncertainty remains over the West/Rockies early
next week with the speed of the upper trough. The 00Z
ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles were displaced a bit farther
northeast than the GFS/GEFS, resulting in a bit quicker pace
toward the Plains/Midwest of the former compared to the latter.
With continued wavering in some GEFS cycles and no clear trend,
opted to split the difference with a blended solution. Lead-in
setup still suggests a multi-day heavy rainfall pattern east of
the Plains though perhaps not in the same place each day as the
frontal zone slowly sinks toward the Gulf Coast. The previous
discussion from 07Z is below for reference.

Fracasso


...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

The amplified upper level flow pattern during the short range
period is expected to become more quasi-zonal by this weekend as
the trough over the Northeast lifts out, and the central U.S.
ridge flattens out.  At the surface, a meandering frontal boundary
with multiple waves of low pressure along it will be the main
weather maker during the medium range period across the central
and southern tier states.

Models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement going into
the weekend, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems.  The GFS is more progressive
with the surface low crossing the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic
region through Monday morning, and the CMC is slower than the
model consensus.  The GFS is also stronger with the upper trough
across the western U.S.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was
based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble
means through Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means
by days 6 and 7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley, where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a stationary front and a wave of low pressure.
The potential exists for 2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally
higher amounts, from eastern Kansas to Kentucky.  Another zone of
heavy rain is also probable across portions of Arkansas,
Mississippi, and Tennessee for next Tuesday and Wednesday with
similar rainfall totals possible.  Some training of thunderstorms
may lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central and western High Plains, and adjacent portions of the
northern Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs
up to 20 degrees below early May averages.  This equates to
readings maxing out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those
areas, and the higher elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern
Colorado can expect some late season accumulating snow, perhaps
exceeding six inches for some of the higher ranges.  Some of these
cooler temperatures should also be realized across Great Lakes and
Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and Canadian surface
high in place, although not as anomalous.

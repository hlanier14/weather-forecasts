Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1058 AM CST Tue Mar 08 2022

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

Dewpoints are in the teens across West Texas, but winds are light.
By this afternoon, winds are expected to strengthen with elevated
fire weather conditions still likely.

..Bentley.. 03/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CST Tue Mar 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure and accompanying cooler temperatures are
expected to suppress widespread significant wildfire-spread concerns
across most of the CONUS today. The main exception would be the far
southern High Plains/Trans Pecos region in southern New Mexico into
far west Texas, where modest surface lee troughing will encourage
dry downslope flow. By afternoon, 15 mph sustained winds coinciding
with 15-20 percent RH will promote Elevated fire weather conditions.
Given the presence of modestly dry fuels, Elevated fire weather
highlights have been introduced.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue March 08 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 14 - 18 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting a 500-hPa flow
pattern consistent with the positive phase of the NAO. Broad troughing is
forecast across the Davis Strait and southern Greenland while anomalous
ridging
is forecast to the south across most of the mid-latitude North Atlantic. Ab=
ove
normal heights associated with the ridging over the Atlantic is forecast to
spread westward during the period, resulting in rising heights across the
eastern CONUS. Low amplitude flow and accompanying above normal heights are
predicted across most of the remainder of the CONUS. A complex flow pattern=
 is
forecast across Alaska as a ridge is likely to the west of the state and a
trough is predicted farther to the south near the Aleutians. As the Aleutia=
n
trough progresses eastward, heights are forecast to lower over the Mainland=
,
resulting in deeper troughing across much of the state relative to
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
outlook. An elevated height gradient is likely across southeastern Alaska a=
nd
the northwestern CONUS, increasing the probability of enhanced Pacific Flow
across these regions.

As a trough near the Great Lakes weakens and ridging over the Atlantic expa=
nds
westward, a significant warming trend is forecast over much of the eastern
CONUS consistent with the positive phase of the NAO. Probabilities of above
normal temperatures exceed 50 percent for parts of the Mid-Atlantic States =
to
southern New England, where height rises associated with the expanding
Atlantic
ridge are forecast to be the greatest. Broad, low amplitude flow and near t=
o
above normal heights lead to increased odds of near to above normal
temperatures for the western and central CONUS. The potential for downslope
flow increases confidence of above normal temperatures across parts of the
Northern and Central High Plains. Below normal temperatures are likely for
most
of Alaska, associated with the trend toward increased troughing forecast by
today's suite of models.

An active pattern is favored for southeastern Alaska and the northwestern
CONUS
due to the likelihood of enhanced Pacific Flow across these regions.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent for parts of =
the
Alaska Panhandle, Pacific Northwest, and Northern Rockies.  An enhanced
temperature gradient is likely across the northern Tier of the CONUS,
promoting
a mean storm track across this region. Therefore, increased odds of near to
above normal precipitation are indicated across much of the northern CONUS.
Below normal precipitation is favored well to the south of the mean storm
track, across most of the southwestern and south-central CONUS. Despite low
confidence among dynamical model guidance precipitation tools across much o=
f
the Plains, natural analogs from today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model 50=
0-hPa indicate a consistent
dry signal. Therefore, below normal precipitation is slightly favored acros=
s
much of the central CONUS. Below normal precipitation is slightly favored f=
or
the Mid-Atlantic States as ridging over the Atlantic is forecast to spread
westward into the region. Farther to the south, return flow moisture is
possible near the periphery of this ridge, leading to slightly elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation across the Southeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement on a positive NAO pattern offset by a trend toward increase=
d
low amplitude flow and a variable pattern across much of the forecast domai=
n.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 16 - 22 2022

During week-2, a 500-hPa flow pattern consistent with the positive phase of
the
NAO is likely to persist through at least the middle of the period.
Additionally, below normal heights are forecast to consolidate across the
higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, consistent with the positive
phase
of the AO. A zonal 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to the south across the
middle latitudes of North America. An increased height gradient likely acro=
ss
much of the CONUS from north to south, promoting enhanced westerlies across
much of the country. These enhanced Westerlies, in turn, are likely to prom=
ote
increased Pacific Flow and a variable pattern across much of the CONUS as
storm
systems quickly traverse the country from west to east.  Farther to the nor=
th
and west, a mean ridge is predicted over the western Aleutians, resulting i=
n
increased downstream troughing across most of Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle.

A pattern consistent with the positive phase of the NAO is forecast to pers=
ist
until at least the middle of week-2, resulting in increased confidence in
above
normal temperatures for most of the Eastern Seaboard. Predicted zonal flow =
and
near to above normal heights leads to increased chances of near to above
normal
temperatures across the central and southwestern CONUS. Composites consiste=
nt
with the forecast positive AO and negative ENSO states depict a cold signal
across the northwestern CONUS. Therefore slightly elevated odds of below
normal
temperatures are indicated for parts of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies. Below normal temperatures are most likely for Alaska as persistent
troughing is forecast across most of the state.

With enhanced Pacific Flow expected, increased odds of above normal
precipitation are indicated for the northwestern CONUS and southeastern
Alaska.
Below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the southwestern and
sound-central CONUS, well to the south of the predicted mean storm track.
Above
normal precipitation is favored from parts of the Mississippi, Tennessee, a=
nd
Ohio valleys, northward to the Great Lakes and interior Northeast, due to t=
he
potential for return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surfa=
ce
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Combined AO/ENSO composites depic=
t a
dry signal to the south and east across the Florida Peninsula, where slight=
ly
elevated odds of below normal precipitation are indicated. Below normal
precipitation is also favored for northern and western Mainland Alaska and =
the
Alaska Peninsula, downstream of a ridge predicted over the western Aleutian=
s.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=

model agreement on a positive AO/NAO pattern offset by a transition toward
zonal flow and a variable pattern across much of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Winter storm threats for parts of the Mid-South to the interior
Northeast Friday-Saturday...

...Heavy rainfall likely across portions of the Southeast on
Friday...


...Overview...

A potent shortwave in the southern Rockies and a northern stream
shortwave through the Midwest early Friday will combine to support
strong cyclogenesis into the Eastern U.S. by Saturday. This
classic spring system will feature snow and cold to the
north/northwest of the surface low, and warm/wet conditions ahead
of the cold front. Upper flow should then become quasi-zonal
Sunday-Monday with a weak shortwave into the Northwest, though may
amplify with time as it reaches the East on Tuesday. The next
shortwave should reach the Pacific Northwest by next Tuesday as
well.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest runs of the models continue to gain confidence with the
melding of the two streams to produce a winter storm system that
will impact the central and eastern U.S. Friday into Saturday.
There remains some timing differences with the passage of the cold
front which is being reflected in the placement of the QPF and the
expected amounts. The GFS has isolated maximums focused on Gulf
side of Florida, while others have streaks of higher amounts
across northern/northeast Florida and into the Carolinas. As
previously noted, GFS had been running faster but it (along with
the UKMET) are now in within the cluster of acceptable guidance.
WPC continued to favor a slightly slower, yet progressive
evolution for this feature which consisted of a blend of the 00Z
ECWMF/CMC/UKMET and 06/00Z GFS through the weekend/early next week
before including increasing weights of the ECWMF ensemble mean and
GEFS mean for the remainder of the forecast. After the exit of the
eastern U.S. system the models are struggling a bit with the
quasi-zonal flow over western half of the country. The Pacific
Northwest will have an increase in precipitation as shortwave
energy tracks through. Inclusion of the means for the latter half
of the forecast helps to reduce the noise and uncertainty. These
are details that will take until the short range period to fully
resolve. So it's hard to throw any solution off the table at this
point.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Deep moisture drawn northward up the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic states
will aid in sustaining showers and thunderstorms near the frontal
boundary over the region. There will be periods of moderate to
heavy rainfall, especially for portions of Florida and southeast
Georgia. This boundary should finally become absorbed/pushed
east/lift northward with the strong cold front on Saturday though.
Rainfall will come in waves over the Southeast, some of which
could be heavy and flooding/flash flooding may be a threat
especially where multiple rounds of convection train over the same
areas and combined with heavy rainfall the previous day in the
same region. Given this potential, the WPC day 4 (Friday) newly
experimental excessive rainfall outlook highlights a slight risk
area from the Florida Big Bend to southeast Georgia. Cold air
pouring into the Central U.S. behind the developing storm system
into Friday will support rain changing to snow behind the front
Friday evening, with accumulations possible as far south as the
lower Mississippi Valley. The central low pressure associated with
this system is expected to deepen rapidly over the Northeast,
which may allow for areas of heavy snowfall for the Great Lakes
and interior Northeast.

The arctic airmass behind the front will bring daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas on Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains and in higher elevations
of the Rockies are likely to be near or below zero for many
locations. Modifying some with time, the cold air will shift into
the Midwest on Saturday and the Eastern U.S. on Sunday following
the frontal passage (with above normal temps ahead of it). Even
for parts of northern Florida and the Southeast, low temperatures
Sunday morning could be near or below freezing with record lows
possible in some locations. By next week, parts of the West and
central U.S. may see moderately above normal temperatures as
periodic upper ridging slides through.

...Winter storm continues into early Sunday for parts of the
Northeast...


...Overview...

Amplified troughing in the East to start the period will support
strong cyclogenesis and rapid deepening of a surface low through
the Northeast on Saturday. This classic spring system will bring
snow to the north/northwest of the low, and rainfall exiting the
East Coast, with chilly weather to follow through the eastern
third of the nation this weekend. Meanwhile, the next shortwave
moves into the Northwest on Sunday, with a very uncertain
evolution as it moves into the East early next week. Upper ridging
should build across the Central U.S. late period, as another,
stronger, trough moves into the West next Tuesday-Wednesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

On the large scale, models continue to hone in on a significant
East Coast system by the start of the period on Saturday. Details
are starting to be worked out as well, with explosive deepening
likely up the Northeast Coast into Sunday. The 12z/Mar 8 run of
the CMC was a little faster/farther east with the surface low, but
the 00z run seems to have come in line. A general model blend of
the deterministic solutions seems to represent well for this low.

A shortwave into the Pacific Northwest on Sunday shows good
agreement on timing, but significant uncertainties begin to arise
farther downstream. The ECMWF has been consistently much more
phased/quicker with the trough as it amplifies and moves into the
East early next week. Meanwhile, the GFS has been pretty
consistent with a separation of streams with the southern stream
closing off a low over the South. Yesterdays 12z run of the CMC
was a nice middle ground. For the new 00z runs today (available
after forecast issuance time), the GFS stayed consistent with
itself, the CMC sped up to look like the 12z EC, but the 00z EC
showed the most dramatic shift, with a closed low feature (albeit
quicker than the GFS). There is enough support for that stronger
feature in various ensemble members (both from the EC and the GFS)
to show a hint of a shortwave/system over the Southeast towards
the end of the period in the ensemble means. The next trough into
the West Tuesday-Wednesday shows some timing uncertainty (GFS
faster, EC/CMC slower). The WPC forecast after day 5, trended
rather quickly towards the ensemble means to help mitigate these
differences, though did keep minor pieces of the GFS and CMC which
kept some semblance of a system across the Southeast early next
week.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moisture ahead of the strong cold front in the East will continue
showers and storms along the boundary across the Southeast,
Mid-Atlantic, and coastal New England, with rain changing to snow
likely for northern and inland regions as temperatures plummet
behind the cold front. Meanwhile, strong dynamics aloft and colder
air wrapping around the low should support a winter storm threat
and accumulating snowfall Saturday into early Sunday across
portions of the interior Northeast, especially northern Vermont,
New Hampshire, and Maine. As the low pressure deepens rapidly on
Saturday, gusty winds are likely to accompany the system across
much of the Eastern states, with winds continuing into Sunday as
well for New England as the storm quickly pulls away. Behind the
front, much below normal temperatures are expected from the lower
Mississippi Valley through the Ohio Valley on Saturday, and into
much of the East by Sunday, with daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal in some places. Even for parts of northern Florida and the
Southeast, low temperatures Sunday morning could be near or below
freezing with record lows possible in some locations.

Meanwhile, rain and mountain snows are likely across the Northwest
next weekend with the passage of the first shortwave. The next
trough early next week looks poised to direct a possible
atmospheric river towards the Pacific Northwest with heavy rain
and higher terrain snow possible across western Washington/Oregon
and northern California, with additional snowfall farther inland
across the northern Rockies. Upper level ridging ahead of this
will build across the central U.S. with daytime highs 10 to 20+
degrees above normal by next Tuesday for the northern/central
Plains, which should be a welcome relief to the very chilly
weather expected later this week. Rain chances should also
increase again over the Gulf Coast and Southeast next
Monday-Tuesday.

...There is a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast today...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Central/Southern Rockies, and
Central Plains today...

...Cold air expands across Plains and Mississippi Valley; there is
a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the Southern
Rockies/Plains...

A strong cold front will continue traveling down across the West
today. Temperatures will fall precipitously on the backside of the
cold front, allowing for heavy snow to spread across the Great
Basin and Northern/Central Plains. High temperatures will likely
be 20-30 degrees below average for many parts of the
Northern/Central Plains today, with some parts of northern Montana
and northern North Dakota failing to climb out of the single
digits. The continued southern progression of the cold front will
also pull cold air farther down the spine of the Great Plains on
Thursday. Highs will be between 20-30 degrees below average for
much of the Central Plains/Rockies/Great Basin. Winter Watches,
Warnings and Advisories are in effect for these areas today. Hot,
dry and windy conditions will contribute to the Critical Fire
Weather threat from parts of southern New Mexico to the Texas
Panhandle. Surface waves traversing down the Rockies will deepen
and spread heavy snow over the Front Range and Nebraska/Kansas
today.

A series of low pressure waves will form along a quasi-stationary
front draped across the Southeast in the coming days. Moderate to
locally heavy rain is possible from parts of the central/eastern
Gulf Coast to the Southeast coast today. Lingering cold air in the
Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic will produce light snow over
those areas tonight. Sufficient instability should allow for
severe thunderstorms to initiate in the Southeast. A Slight Risk
of Severe thunderstorms was issued by the Storm Prediction Center
for parts of the Florida Panhandle and Southeast Coast. Damaging
winds, isolated hail and a couple tornadoes are possible.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0127 AM CST Wed Mar 09 2022

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow will prevail across the south-central U.S today.
During the day, a mid-level impulse embedded in the broader cyclonic
upper flow will impinge on the Plains states, encouraging the
development and intensification of a surface low across the southern
High Plains. To the west of the low, critically dry and windy
conditions will develop and support wildfire-spread potential.

...Southern High Plains...
By afternoon, intensifying gradient flow from the passing surface
cyclone will support 20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds coinciding with 15 percent RH from roughly 20-00Z across much
of central, southern, and eastern New Mexico into the Oklahoma/Texas
Panhandles, and the Trans Pecos region of southwest Texas. Low-end
Critical fire weather conditions are expected given that fuels
remain modestly receptive to wildfire spread (i.e. forecast ERCs in
the 60-80 percent range). However, guidance has trended weaker with
the surface winds, and the latest guidance consensus does indicate
the potential for some high-level cloud cover across central New
Mexico, which may reduce boundary-layer mixing. If guidance
continues to trend weaker with the winds, the Critical area may need
to be removed for the 17Z Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook update.

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
Another in a series of mid-level impulses embedded in the larger
scale cyclonic upper flow regime will traverse the Southwest
tomorrow/Thursday, supporting surface low development across central
New Mexico. Dry and windy surface conditions will result, with 15-25
mph sustained westerly surface winds overlapping 15-20 percent RH
during the mid to late afternoon hours, mainly across southern New
Mexico into the Trans Pecos region of southwest Texas. Elevated
highlights have been introduced to address the wildfire-spread
threat. Concerns for mid-level cloud cover exist over the Elevated

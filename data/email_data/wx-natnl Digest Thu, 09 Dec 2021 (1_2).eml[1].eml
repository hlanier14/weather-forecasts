Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CST Wed Dec 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

The ongoing forecast remains generally on track with only minor
adjustments needed to reflect morning observations and recent trends
in hi-res guidance. Although lee troughing has been modest so far
this morning along the southern High Plains, regional VADs show
20-30 mph winds within the residual layer above the nocturnal
inversion. Daytime heating will help mix these stronger winds to the
surface my late morning and into the afternoon, though incoming
mid/upper-level clouds may hinder diurnal warming to some degree.
Despite these concerns, areas of elevated conditions remain probable
this afternoon. Further north, 20-30% RH and locally breezy
downslope winds are noted along and just west of the I-25 corridor
from southern CO to southeast WY. Morning guidance continues to
suggest elevated conditions are possible along the Front Range, but
the threat will remain fairly localized.

..Moore.. 12/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CST Wed Dec 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude southern stream shortwave trough and attendant
midlevel speed maximum will advance eastward from the Desert
Southwest and overspread the southern Rockies and adjacent High
Plains by this evening. Surface lee troughing is already established
across the High Plains, and the emergence of the southwesterly
midlevel speed maximum will aid in enhancing the surface pressure
gradient over portions of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle
vicinity.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to perhaps spotty Critical fire-weather conditions are
expected across parts of eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle
this afternoon. Here, downslope trajectories off the southern
Rockies will support RH reductions into the upper teens to lower 20s
amid breezy west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph with
higher gusts. While increasing mid/high-level cloud coverage
preceding the shortwave trough may limit diurnal RH reductions to an
extent, high-resolution model guidance continues to depict the
development of critically low RH in response to adiabatic
warming/drying across the region.

...Central High Plains...
A brief period of locally Elevated fire-weather conditions may
develop this afternoon, as enhanced midlevel flow peripheral to the
previously mentioned speed maximum glances parts of southeastern
Wyoming, northeastern Colorado, and the Nebraska Panhandle. With
that said, continued disagreement amongst the short-range model
guidance regarding a favorable overlap of low RH and breezy surface
winds precludes highlights at this time, though trends will be
monitored.

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 15 2021

...Locally heavy rain possible particularly in the southern
Appalachians Saturday with record-breaking warmth along the
Eastern Seaboard ahead of a strong cold front...

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
this weekend into early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through the weekend, as a mid-upper trough pushes from the
central U.S. Saturday toward the East by Sunday, while a surface
low and potent cold front track ahead of it. Record-setting warm
temperatures and moderate to locally heavy precipitation are
likely in the East ahead of the cold front. Meanwhile, a
slow-moving and reloading trough in the eastern Pacific will
direct a persistent and moist inflow (atmospheric river) to the
West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and mountain snows likely that
should spread southward with time. The overall pattern is expected
to stagnate Monday and Tuesday with upper ridging building into
much of the lower 48 to the east of the Pacific trough, before the
trough begins to make its way eastward around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the 00/06z cycle continues to show very good
agreement through most of the period with the pattern described
above. After some previous waffling, guidance has been consistent
for a couple of cycles now showing a more phased (no
northern/southern stream separation) trough in the East over the
weekend, causing a faster track of the trough and associated cold
front, so this trend was maintained in the WPC forecast. Farther
west, there remain some model differences with the eastern Pacific
trough regarding the distribution of energy and the potential for
a closed low to develop (especially with GFS runs) within it. But
overall guidance agrees in a slow track of the trough axis
southward bringing persistent moist southwesterly flow into the
West Coast. There are increasing timing differences among
deterministic and ensemble guidance with the trough eventually
pushing eastward Tuesday and Wednesday, along with distribution of
shortwaves within it. The CMC is the quickest to eject this trough
into the Southwest U.S. next Wednesday, the ECMWF slowest (still
back along the coast), with the GFS sitting in between. Spaghetti
diagrams of various ensemble solutions suggest the deterministic
CMC may be too quick, and the better consensus is somewhere around
the ECMWF/GFS (which is also consistent with the ensemble means).

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
00/06z guidance early in the period, and was able to hold onto a
majority deterministic models blend through day 6 (without the CMC
due to reasons above). Day 7, leaned more on the ensemble means
due to troughing timing issues in the West. This maintained
excellent continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong cold front will track through the eastern third of the
U.S. on Saturday into Sunday and spread widespread rain with
embedded thunderstorms along and ahead of it. There is potential
for heavy rain amounts with quick-hitting high rainfall rates for
portions of the Southeast, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Appalachians, which could cause localized flooding/flash flooding
issues especially in the more sensitive terrain of the southern
Appalachians. With a quicker upper trough and cold frontal track,
moisture will likely clear out of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday,
and with high pressure in its wake, dry conditions are likely in
the central and eastern U.S. for the first part of next week other
than some possibility of increasing showers in the south-central
U.S. and Great Lakes by Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, persistent
moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies Saturday,
and then will track south into California by early next week.
Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern
Rockies, and spreading to the central Great Basin and Arizona by
Tuesday. Localized flash flooding could be a concern, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas in northern California.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast for the eastern third of the U.S. on Saturday. Dozens of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures could be set
from the central Gulf Coast to Northeast with temperatures 20-30F
above normal. Temperatures should moderate to near normal behind,
but by early next week as ridging builds over the region,
temperatures are expected to warm to 10-20F above normal on Sunday
in the central U.S., with warmth expanding into the eastern U.S.
as the workweek begins, and warming further to possibly 30+F above
average in parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley by
next Wednesday.

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 15 2021

...Locally heavy rain possible particularly in the southern
Appalachians Saturday with record-breaking warmth along the
Eastern Seaboard ahead of a strong cold front...

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
this weekend into early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through the weekend, as a mid-upper trough pushes from the
central U.S. Saturday toward the East by Sunday, while a surface
low and potent cold front track ahead of it. Record-setting warm
temperatures and moderate to locally heavy precipitation are
likely in the East ahead of the cold front. Meanwhile, a
slow-moving and reloading trough in the eastern Pacific will
direct a persistent and moist inflow (atmospheric river) to the
West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and mountain snows likely that
should spread southward with time. The overall pattern is expected
to stagnate Monday and Tuesday with upper ridging building into
much of the lower 48 to the east of the Pacific trough, before the
trough begins to make its way eastward around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the 00/06z cycle continues to show very good
agreement through most of the period with the pattern described
above. After some previous waffling, guidance has been consistent
for a couple of cycles now showing a more phased (no
northern/southern stream separation) trough in the East over the
weekend, causing a faster track of the trough and associated cold
front, so this trend was maintained in the WPC forecast. Farther
west, there remain some model differences with the eastern Pacific
trough regarding the distribution of energy and the potential for
a closed low to develop (especially with GFS runs) within it. But
overall guidance agrees in a slow track of the trough axis
southward bringing persistent moist southwesterly flow into the
West Coast. There are increasing timing differences among
deterministic and ensemble guidance with the trough eventually
pushing eastward Tuesday and Wednesday, along with distribution of
shortwaves within it. The CMC is the quickest to eject this trough
into the Southwest U.S. next Wednesday, the ECMWF slowest (still
back along the coast), with the GFS sitting in between. Spaghetti
diagrams of various ensemble solutions suggest the deterministic
CMC may be too quick, and the better consensus is somewhere around
the ECMWF/GFS (which is also consistent with the ensemble means).

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
00/06z guidance early in the period, and was able to hold onto a
majority deterministic models blend through day 6 (without the CMC
due to reasons above). Day 7, leaned more on the ensemble means
due to troughing timing issues in the West. This maintained
excellent continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong cold front will track through the eastern third of the
U.S. on Saturday into Sunday and spread widespread rain with
embedded thunderstorms along and ahead of it. There is potential
for heavy rain amounts with quick-hitting high rainfall rates for
portions of the Southeast, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Appalachians, which could cause localized flooding/flash flooding
issues especially in the more sensitive terrain of the southern
Appalachians. With a quicker upper trough and cold frontal track,
moisture will likely clear out of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday,
and with high pressure in its wake, dry conditions are likely in
the central and eastern U.S. for the first part of next week other
than some possibility of increasing showers in the south-central
U.S. and Great Lakes by Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, persistent
moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies Saturday,
and then will track south into California by early next week.
Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern
Rockies, and spreading to the central Great Basin and Arizona by
Tuesday. Localized flash flooding could be a concern, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas in northern California.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast for the eastern third of the U.S. on Saturday. Dozens of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures could be set
from the central Gulf Coast to Northeast with temperatures 20-30F
above normal. Temperatures should moderate to near normal behind,
but by early next week as ridging builds over the region,
temperatures are expected to warm to 10-20F above normal on Sunday
in the central U.S., with warmth expanding into the eastern U.S.
as the workweek begins, and warming further to possibly 30+F above
average in parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley by
next Wednesday.

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

The forecast outlined below remains on track with only minor
modifications needed to reflect recent trends in hi-res and ensemble
guidance. Questions still remain regarding the impact of cloud cover
on diurnal RH reductions, but strong winds remain likely -
especially across southeast NM/west TX under an axis of stronger low
to mid-level flow. Elevated conditions are possible to the north of
the outlined risk area into northeast NM and the TX Panhandle, but
confidence in sufficient overlap of elevated wind/RH conditions is
lower.

..Moore.. 12/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CST Wed Dec 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A belt of enhanced midlevel west-southwesterly downslope flow will
remain in place over the southern Rockies on Thursday, maintaining a
tight surface pressure gradient over the southern High Plains. As a
lee surface low deepens over the northern Plains, low-level
west-southwesterly flow will strengthen across the southern High
Plains in response.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to locally Critical fire-weather conditions are anticipated
across portions of the southern High Plains on Thursday afternoon,
as low/mid-level west-southwesterly downslope flow strengthens
across the region. Similar to Wednesday, substantial mid/high-level
clouds may limit diurnal RH reductions to an extent. However,
high-resolution model guidance continues to depict a few hours of RH
in the 15-25 percent range, coincident with breezy surface winds of
15-25 mph and higher gusts.

...Developing winter storm will produce the first widespread and
significant snow of the season across parts of the Sierra Nevada,
Intermountain West, Central Rockies, and Central Plains through
Friday...

...Slight Risk of Severe Weather for parts of the
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys on Friday into Friday night...

...Light snow possible across the Northeast tonight and Upper
Great Lakes on Thursday...

...Potentially record-breaking warm temperatures to build across
the south-central and eastern United States...

The main weather story for the latter part of the week will be a
developing winter storm that is expected to impact much of the
western mountain ranges and central U.S.. Short-wave energy,
currently way out in the Pacific, will amplify and phase with a
southern stream system as it enters the CONUS Thursday morning.
The strengthening of the upper-trough will lead to the development
of a surface wave over the Intermountain West. This developing
system will produce a swath of 8-12 inches of snow extending from
the Sierra Nevada, through the Intermountain West and into the
Central Rockies. Locally higher amounts are likely over the
highest elevations of Utah and the northern Colorado Rockies.
Meanwhile light snow will fall over parts of the Northeast and
Great Lakes tomorrow behind one system departing into the Canadian
Maritime and another moving across central Canada. Additional snow
will fall over the Central Rockies and Utah highlands on Friday as
the surface low begins to deepen and ramp up over Central Plains.
Between 2-3 feet of snow is likely over much of the Central
Rockies by Saturday morning. A swath of snow, on the magnitude of
4-8 inches, will develop in the cold sector of this system from
the Front Range across the Central Plains and into the Upper
Mississippi Valley on Friday. Light snow continues for the
Cascades on Friday as well. Scattered thunderstorms are expected
to overspread much of the Deep South on Friday as the deepening
system develops into a dynamic mid-latitude cyclone and begins to
tap into rich moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Severe
Thunderstorms are possible Friday into Friday night across parts
of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and the Tennessee/Ohio
Valleys due to increased instability caused by this storm. Heavy
snowfall is forecast to spread into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
by Friday evening.

The approaching winter storm will generate a strong plume of warm
moist air into the

300 PM EST December 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure continues to be anticipated across =
the
western (eastern) half of the lower 48 during week-2. The orientation of th=
e
mid-level low pressure across the West, however, is less conducive to
widespread heavy precipitation than week-1. The heaviest precipitation for
week-2 is anticipated to be in the form of heavy snow across higher elevati=
on
areas of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada mountains at the beginni=
ng
of the period. This pattern is also likely to support much below normal
temperatures across parts of the West. Frontal activity across the
southeastern
quadrant of the contiguous U.S. may support enhanced precipitation during t=
he
beginning to middle of the period. There is a possibility for mid-level low
pressure across parts of Alaska to support much below normal temperatures
across southern portions of the state, although there is increased model
uncertainty compared to earlier in the week due to the pattern being more
transitional.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, Southwest, and California, Thu-Sat, Dec 16-18.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Northern
Plains, Tue-Wed, Dec 21-22.

Slight risk of heavy snow for higher elevation areas in northern California
and
portions of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Tue-Wed, Dec 16-17.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of coastal central and southern
California,
Thu-Sun, Dec 16-19.

D1RsjZRl5FD$

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 16 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 22: There is relatively good
agreement between the 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, indicating a
positively
tilted mid-level trough over the western third of the CONUS at the beginnin=
g
of
week-2. This feature is anticipated to gradually weaken and propagate eastw=
ard
to the central CONUS toward the end of the period, while a mid-level shortw=
ave
trough forms off the coast of the Northwest. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean =
is
an outlier, showing the initial trough axis being located further West and
being more progressive than the other models. Mid-level troughing across th=
e
West continues to support anomalous cold across parts of the western third =
of
the CONUS during the period. A slight risk of much below normal temperature=
s
is
highlighted for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, Southwest, and
California, Dec 16 to 18, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicat=
e
at
least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile and freezing.



The mid-level trough across the West may continue to support surface low
pressure extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the West Coast. Although the
orientation is not as favorable for widespread heavy precipitation compared=
 to
previous days, there may still be chances for localized heavy precipitation
across higher elevation areas of northern California and the Sierra Nevadas=
 at
the beginning of the period. A slight risk of heavy snow is posted for thes=
e
areas, Dec 16 to 17, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% cha=
nce
of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inc=
h.



There is relatively good model agreement indicating surface high pressure
extending southward from central and western Canada into the northern-centr=
al
CONUS toward the end of the period, ushering in cold arctic air to the regi=
on.
A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
Northern Plains at the end of the period (Dec 21 to 22), where the reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 15th percentile and below zero degrees F.



There is multi-model (ensemble mean) depiction of surface pressure building
over the Central Great Basin from the beginning to middle of week-2. This
feature may support enhanced downsloping winds across portions of central a=
nd
Southern California. A slight risk of high winds is highlighted for Souther=
n
California and coastal areas near San Francisco, where Santa Ana and Diablo
winds, respectively, are most likely.



Multiple ensemble means and recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF solutions
indicate the potential for frontal activity across the South-Central CONUS
from
the beginning to middle of the period. Potential frontal activity combined
with
enhanced onshore flow from the Gulf of Mexico due to surface high pressure
over
the southwestern CONUS supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation across
parts of the Ohio Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and
Southern Plains, Dec 17 to 19. The reforecast tools are in relatively good
agreement and have had good run to run model consistency indicating at leas=
t a
20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one
inch.



Multiple model ensemble means indicate mid-level troughing across parts of
Mainland Alaska at the beginning of the period, which could  support linger=
ing
anomalously cold temperatures from the end of week-1. There are significant
model differences, however, among model guidance regarding the synoptic
pattern
and resultant temperatures due to a more transitional pattern being
anticipated
for week-2. Therefore, the moderate risk of much below normal temperatures =
has
been removed in today's outlook. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted for a more limited region than previous outlook=
s,
across parts of southern Mainland Alaska, Dec 16 to 19. This trough is
predicted to shift eastward later in the period to the Alaska Panhandle,
supporting a slight risk of much below normal temperatures across this regi=
on,
Dec 20 to 22. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimu=
m
temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile for both highlighted ris=
k
areas over Alaska.



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is favored to support a large scale
environment which is conducive for a wet pattern over Hawaii during week-2.
Expected precipitation could support localized flooding where there is alre=
ady
saturated ground, but also provide relief to some areas currently experienc=
ing
severe drought. More than a quarter of Hawaii is currently designated in
severe
to exceptional drought.

There remains strong agreement among the dynamical models regarding an
amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain,
particularly early in the 6-10 day period. Anomalous troughing and associat=
ed
below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast near much of the west coast of No=
rth
America, including over Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and much of =
the
western CONUS. Enhanced ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
favored on both sides of this trough, across the north-central Pacific,
including the Aleutians, and over most of the CONUS east of the Rockies. Th=
e
magnitude of the positive height anomalies across the eastern CONUS and the
negative anomalies along the West Coast are generally forecast to peak earl=
y
in
the period. Upstream ridging forecast near the Aleutians early in the perio=
d
is
forecast to weaken and then reload again by Day 10.

The anomalous ridging across the eastern and central CONUS, along with the
forecast positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation, supports unseasonably wa=
rm
temperatures over a broad region of the CONUS, excluding the West Coast.
Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast indicates elevated probabilities=
 of above normal
temperatures
from the Rockies to the East Coast, which is also supported by the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools. The highest probabilities (>90 percent) are located
over parts of the Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio
Valley, corresponding with large positive 500-hPa height anomalies and
enhanced
southerly flow. Maximum temperatures near 30 deg F above normal are possibl=
e
for parts of this region early in the period. Anomalous troughing supports
increased chances of near to below normal temperatures to the west of the
Rockies and over most of Alaska.

Mid-level ridging over the eastern CONUS and associated surface high pressu=
re
favor increased probabilities of below normal precipitation across the East=
ern
Seaboard. The potential for return flow around this surface high pressure
leads
to elevated above normal precipitation probabilities from the Southern Plai=
ns
northward to the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley and the western Great
Lakes. Troughing over the western CONUS favors increased probabilities for
above normal precipitation over most of the western third of the CONUS.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 60 percent for much of t=
he
southwestern CONUS, as a frontal boundary pushes south along the West Coast
early in the period. Above normal precipitation is favored for much of Alas=
ka,
underneath predicted mean mid-level cyclonic flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
excellent model agreement regarding an amplified pattern forecast across No=
rth
America, and in the temperature tools, offset slightly by relatively higher
uncertainty in the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 16 - 22 2021

An amplified 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to continue into week-2. Ridg=
ing
is forecast to reload near the Aleutians early and then gain in strength ne=
ar
the western Mainland during the middle and end of the period. In response,
after some initial weakening, troughing is forecast to re-develop and ampli=
fy
across the Alaska Panhandle and the Pacific Northwest by the end of week-2.
Downstream ridging and positive height anomalies are favored to persist ove=
r
the central and eastern CONUS with the mean center of associated positive
height anomalies (>120 meters) forecast over the northern Mid-Atlantic regi=
on.

The enhanced ridging over the eastern and central CONUS supports an
anomalously
warm pattern for most areas to the east of the Rockies during the week-2
period. There is a large region with probabilities greater than 80 percent
extending from the Southern Plains to parts of the Eastern Seaboard. Elevat=
ed
below normal temperature probabilities continue to be favored across the mu=
ch
of the western third of the CONUS and southeastern Alaska associated with
troughing. A moderating trend is favored for western and northern Alaska, a=
s a
ridge is forecast to strengthen later in the period. As this ridge builds, =
a
deepening trough predicted downstream signals a potential trend toward a
colder
pattern across the Panhandle southward to the northwestern CONUS.

Elevated probabilities of near to below normal precipitation remain favored
across the Eastern Seaboard, underneath predicted mean surface high pressur=
e.
Enhanced return flow from the Gulf of Mexico behind this surface high press=
ure
leads to increased probabilities of above normal precipitation across much =
of
the east-central CONUS. Increased troughing over the west generally favors
elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation for most of the wester=
n
quarter of the CONUS. Near to below normal precipitation is slightly favore=
d
across Alaska, as increased surface high pressure and offshore flow is
predicted across much of the state in the wake of this trough.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean

n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good agreement in the overall large scale 500-hPa and temperature
patterns, offset by relatively lower confidence among the precipitation too=

...Developing winter storm will produce the first widespread and
significant snow of the season across parts of the Sierra Nevada,
Intermountain West, Central Rockies, and Central Plains through
Friday...

...Slight Risk of Severe Weather for parts of the
Mississippi/Tennessee/Ohio Valleys on Friday into Friday night...

...Light snow possible across the Northeast tonight and Upper
Great Lakes on Thursday...

...Potentially record-breaking warm temperatures to build across
the south-central, Midwest and eastern United States...

The main weather story for the latter part of the work week will
be a developing winter storm that is expected to impact much of
the western mountain ranges and central U.S.. Short-wave energy,
currently way out in the Pacific, will amplify and phase with a
southern stream system as it enters the CONUS Thursday morning.
Strengthening of the upper-trough will lead to the development of
a surface wave over the Intermountain West. This developing system
will produce a swath of 8-12 inches of snow extending from the
Sierra Nevada, through the Intermountain West and into the Central
Rockies on Thursday. Locally higher amounts are likely over the
highest elevations of Utah and the northern Colorado Rockies.
Meanwhile light snow will fall over parts of the Northeast and
Great Lakes tonight and tomorrow, respectively, behind one system
departing into the Canadian Maritime and another moving across
central Canada. Additional snow will fall over the Central Rockies
and Utah mountains on Friday as the surface low begins to deepen
and ramp up precipitation over the Central Plains. Between 2-3
feet of snow is expected to accumulate over much of the Central
Rockies by Saturday morning. A swath of snow, on the magnitude of
4-8 inches, will develop in the cold sector of this system from
the Front Range across the Central Plains and into the Upper
Mississippi Valley on Friday. Light snow continues for the
Cascades through Friday as well. Scattered thunderstorms are
expected to overspread much of the Deep South into the Midwest on
Friday as the deepening system develops into a dynamic
mid-latitude cyclone; tapping into rich moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico. Severe Thunderstorms are possible Friday into Friday night
across parts of the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley and the
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys due to increased instability caused by this
system. Heavy snow is forecast to spread into the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes by Friday evening.

The approaching winter storm will generate a plume of anomalously
warm air into the south-central U.S. and Midwest on Thursday and
Friday before spreading that warmth into the eastern third of the
country on Friday night into Saturday. Widespread temperature
records may be set over much of eastern/central Texas through to
the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley on Friday as temperatures are
expected to be between 20-30 degrees above average. Record
breaking temperatures are likely to arrive over the eastern third
of the country Friday night and Saturday with lows across the
Southeast through Ohio Valley Friday night likely to be 25-30
degrees above average. Elevated Fire Weather Risk is in effect for
parts of the Southern Plains over the next couple of days as the
developing winter storm produces dry and windy conditions across
the region.

...Locally heavy rain possible particularly in the southern
Appalachians Saturday with record-breaking warmth along the
Eastern Seaboard ahead of a strong cold front...

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
this weekend into early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy
mountain snow...

...Overview...

A generally progressive and active weather pattern is forecast to
occur through the weekend, as a mid-upper trough pushes from the
central U.S. Saturday toward the East by Sunday, while a surface
low and potent cold front track ahead of it. Record-setting warm
temperatures and moderate to locally heavy precipitation are
likely in the East ahead of the cold front. Meanwhile, a
slow-moving and reloading trough in the eastern Pacific will
direct a persistent and moist inflow (atmospheric river) to the
West Coast, with heavy coastal rain and mountain snows likely that
should spread southward with time. The overall pattern is expected
to stagnate Monday and Tuesday with upper ridging building into
much of the lower 48 to the east of the Pacific trough, before the
trough begins to make its way eastward around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the 00/06z cycle continues to show very good
agreement through most of the period with the pattern described
above. After some previous waffling, guidance has been consistent
for a couple of cycles now showing a more phased (no
northern/southern stream separation) trough in the East over the
weekend, causing a faster track of the trough and associated cold
front, so this trend was maintained in the WPC forecast. Farther
west, there remain some model differences with the eastern Pacific
trough regarding the distribution of energy and the potential for
a closed low to develop (especially with GFS runs) within it. But
overall guidance agrees in a slow track of the trough axis
southward bringing persistent moist southwesterly flow into the
West Coast. There are increasing timing differences among
deterministic and ensemble guidance with the trough eventually
pushing eastward Tuesday and Wednesday, along with distribution of
shortwaves within it. The CMC is the quickest to eject this trough
into the Southwest U.S. next Wednesday, the ECMWF slowest (still
back along the coast), with the GFS sitting in between. Spaghetti
diagrams of various ensemble solutions suggest the deterministic
CMC may be too quick, and the better consensus is somewhere around
the ECMWF/GFS (which is also consistent with the ensemble means).

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
00/06z guidance early in the period, and was able to hold onto a
majority deterministic models blend through day 6 (without the CMC
due to reasons above). Day 7, leaned more on the ensemble means
due to troughing timing issues in the West. This maintained
excellent continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong cold front will track through the eastern third of the
U.S. on Saturday into Sunday and spread widespread rain with
embedded thunderstorms along and ahead of it. There is potential
for heavy rain amounts with quick-hitting high rainfall rates for
portions of the Southeast, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Appalachians, which could cause localized flooding/flash flooding
issues especially in the more sensitive terrain of the southern
Appalachians. With a quicker upper trough and cold frontal track,
moisture will likely clear out of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday,
and with high pressure in its wake, dry conditions are likely in
the central and eastern U.S. for the first part of next week other
than some possibility of increasing showers in the south-central
U.S. and Great Lakes by Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, persistent
moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies Saturday,
and then will track south into California by early next week.
Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern
Rockies, and spreading to the central Great Basin and Arizona by
Tuesday. Localized flash flooding could be a concern, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas in northern California.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast for the eastern third of the U.S. on Saturday. Dozens of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures could be set
from the central Gulf Coast to Northeast with temperatures 20-30F
above normal. Temperatures should moderate to near normal behind,
but by early next week as ridging builds over the region,
temperatures are expected to warm to 10-20F above normal on Sunday
in the central U.S., with warmth expanding into the eastern U.S.
as the workweek begins, and warming further to possibly 30+F above
average in parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley by
next Wednesday.

overall guidance agrees in a slow track of the trough axis
southward bringing persistent moist southwesterly flow into the
West Coast. There are increasing timing differences among
deterministic and ensemble guidance with the trough eventually
pushing eastward Tuesday and Wednesday, along with distribution of
shortwaves within it. The CMC is the quickest to eject this trough
into the Southwest U.S. next Wednesday, the ECMWF slowest (still
back along the coast), with the GFS sitting in between. Spaghetti
diagrams of various ensemble solutions suggest the deterministic
CMC may be too quick, and the better consensus is somewhere around
the ECMWF/GFS (which is also consistent with the ensemble means).

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
00/06z guidance early in the period, and was able to hold onto a
majority deterministic models blend through day 6 (without the CMC
due to reasons above). Day 7, leaned more on the ensemble means
due to troughing timing issues in the West. This maintained
excellent continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong cold front will track through the eastern third of the
U.S. on Saturday into Sunday and spread widespread rain with
embedded thunderstorms along and ahead of it. There is potential
for heavy rain amounts with quick-hitting high rainfall rates for
portions of the Southeast, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and
Appalachians, which could cause localized flooding/flash flooding
issues especially in the more sensitive terrain of the southern
Appalachians. With a quicker upper trough and cold frontal track,
moisture will likely clear out of the Eastern Seaboard by Sunday,
and with high pressure in its wake, dry conditions are likely in
the central and eastern U.S. for the first part of next week other
than some possibility of increasing showers in the south-central
U.S. and Great Lakes by Monday and Tuesday. Meanwhile, persistent
moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river is likely
initially in the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies Saturday,
and then will track south into California by early next week.
Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with heavy
mountain snow in the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and northern
Rockies, and spreading to the central Great Basin and Arizona by
Tuesday. Localized flash flooding could be a concern, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas in northern California.

Ahead of the trough and cold front, mild to warm temperatures are
forecast for the eastern third of the U.S. on Saturday. Dozens of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures could be set
from the central Gulf Coast to Northeast with temperatures 20-30F
above normal. Temperatures should moderate to near normal behind,
but by early next week as ridging builds over the region,
temperatures are expected to warm to 10-20F above normal on Sunday
in the central U.S., with warmth expanding into the eastern U.S.
as the workweek begins, and warming further to possibly 30+F above
average in parts of the central Plains and Mississippi Valley by
next Wednesday.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST December 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure continues to be anticipated across =
the
western (eastern) half of the lower 48 during week-2. The orientation of th=
e
mid-level low pressure across the West, however, is less conducive to
widespread heavy precipitation than week-1. The heaviest precipitation for
week-2 is anticipated to be in the form of heavy snow across higher elevati=
on
areas of Northern California and the Sierra Nevada mountains at the beginni=
ng
of the period. This pattern is also likely to support much below normal
temperatures across parts of the West. Frontal activity across the
southeastern
quadrant of the contiguous U.S. may support enhanced precipitation during t=
he
beginning to middle of the period. There is a possibility for mid-level low
pressure across parts of Alaska to support much below normal temperatures
across southern portions of the state, although there is increased model
uncertainty compared to earlier in the week due to the pattern being more
transitional.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Great Basin, Southwest, and California, Thu-Sat, Dec 16-18.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Northern
Plains, Tue-Wed, Dec 21-22.

Slight risk of heavy snow for higher elevation areas in northern California
and
portions of the Sierra Nevada mountains, Tue-Wed, Dec 16-17.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of coastal central and southern
California,
Thu-Sun, Dec 16-19.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Ohio Valley, Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southern Plains, Fri-Sun, Dec 17-=
19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of southern Mainlan=
d
Alaska, Thu-Sun, Dec 16-19.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Alaska
Panhandle, Mon-Wed, Dec 20-22.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY DECEMBER 11 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!skt80eJad4KcoB0Xd9RkhhWJ72xOgON2D5X0y5S6HjDQvadPFlQgVXfyYHpjn=
ClPe9XXhe2v$

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 16 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 22: There is relatively good
agreement between the 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, indicating a
positively
tilted mid-level trough over the western third of the CONUS at the beginnin=
g
of
week-2. This feature is anticipated to gradually weaken and propagate eastw=
ard
to the central CONUS toward the end of the period, while a mid-level shortw=
ave
trough forms off the coast of the Northwest. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean =
is
an outlier, showing the initial trough axis being located further West and
being more progressive than the other models. Mid-level troughing across th=
e
West continues to support anomalous cold across parts of the western third =
of
the CONUS during the period. A slight risk of much below normal temperature=
s
is
highlighted for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, Southwest, and
California, Dec 16 to 18, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicat=
e
at
least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile and freezing.



The mid-level trough across the West may continue to support surface low
pressure extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the West Coast. Although the
orientation is not as favorable for widespread heavy precipitation compared=
 to
previous days, there may still be chances for localized heavy precipitation
across higher elevation areas of northern California and the Sierra Nevadas=
 at
the beginning of the period. A slight risk of heavy snow is posted for thes=
e
areas, Dec 16 to 17, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% cha=
nce
of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inc=
h.



There is relatively good model agreement indicating surface high pressure
extending southward from central and western Canada into the northern-centr=
al
CONUS toward the end of the period, ushering in cold arctic air to the regi=
on.
A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
Northern Plains at the end of the period (Dec 21 to 22), where the reforeca=
st
tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the
lowest 15th percentile and below zero degrees F.



There is multi-model (ensemble mean) depiction of surface pressure building
over the Central Great Basin from the beginning to middle of week-2. This
feature may support enhanced downsloping winds across portions of central a=
nd
Southern California. A slight risk of high winds is highlighted for Souther=
n
California and coastal areas near San Francisco, where Santa Ana and Diablo
winds, respectively, are most likely.



Multiple ensemble means and recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF solutions
indicate the potential for frontal activity across the South-Central CONUS
from
the beginning to middle of the period. Potential frontal activity combined
with
enhanced onshore flow from the Gulf of Mexico due to surface high pressure
over
the southwestern CONUS supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation across
parts of the Ohio Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and
Southern Plains, Dec 17 to 19. The reforecast tools are in relatively good
agreement and have had good run to run model consistency indicating at leas=
t a
20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one
inch.



Multiple model ensemble means indicate mid-level troughing across parts of
Mainland Alaska at the beginning of the period, which could  support linger=
ing
anomalously cold temperatures from the end of week-1. There are significant
model differences, however, among model guidance regarding the synoptic
pattern
and resultant temperatures due to a more transitional pattern being
anticipated
for week-2. Therefore, the moderate risk of much below normal temperatures =
has
been removed in today's outlook. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted for a more limited region than previous outlook=
s,
across parts of southern Mainland Alaska, Dec 16 to 19. This trough is
predicted to shift eastward later in the period to the Alaska Panhandle,
supporting a slight risk of much below normal temperatures across this regi=
on,
Dec 20 to 22. The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimu=
m
temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile for both highlighted ris=
k
areas over Alaska.



The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is favored to support a large scale
environment which is conducive for a wet pattern over Hawaii during week-2.
Expected precipitation could support localized flooding where there is alre=
ady
saturated ground, but also provide relief to some areas currently experienc=
ing
severe drought. More than a quarter of Hawaii is currently designated in
severe
to exceptional drought.

...An atmospheric river will spread southward along the West Coast
early next week bringing coastal rain and heavy mountain snow...

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Sunday with upper troughing
across the East that will move quickly into the Atlantic, with
upper ridging behind it expanding from the central U.S. into the
eastern U.S. as the workweek starts, causing unseasonably warm
temperatures. Meanwhile, a slowly digging and reloading trough in
the eastern Pacific will direct a persistent and moist inflow
(atmospheric river) to the West Coast, with coastal rain and heavy
mountain snows that should spread south and eastward with time as
the trough moves. By Wednesday into Thursday, an upper low may
spin up from the trough along with a surface low, which could
bring another round of precipitation to the north-central U.S. but
with low confidence in the details.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12/18Z (yesterday) cycle of model guidance continues to show
very good agreement especially through the first part of the
period with the overall pattern described above. There remain some
minor model differences initially with the eastern Pacific trough
regarding the distribution of energy and the potential
for/placement of a closed low to develop within it. By around
Tuesday, there are some slight model differences with the timing
of the trough axis shifting eastward. The deterministic guidance
was generally within the center of the guidance envelope, while
GEFS ensemble members generally take a faster/more eastern track
compared to EC ensemble members. But overall guidance agrees in a
track of the trough axis southward and then eastward, bringing
persistent moist southwesterly flow into the West Coast early in
the week and spreading inland by Tuesday. Greater differences
arise by Wednesday-Thursday with this trough as it ejects farther
eastward and with upstream shortwave energy dropping south through
the eastern Pacific. While there are some variations in strength
and track of these features, the 12/18Z deterministic models have
good consensus spinning up a closed mid-upper low in the
north-central U.S. by Thursday (though some incoming 00Z guidance
shows a compact shortwave that is not closed). A surface low
associated with this feature varies somewhat in depth and track as
well, but at least there is consensus for the existence of these
features by the end of the medium range period. Meanwhile, models
agree with the broad ridging across central and eastern parts of
the U.S. through much of the week.

The WPC forecast utilized a multi-model deterministic blend of the
12/18Z guidance early in the period, and was able to hold onto a
majority deterministic models blend through the period given
reasonably good agreement, though increased reliance on the
ensemble means especially by day 7. This maintained excellent
continuity with the previous WPC forecast for days 3-6 as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Moist onshore flow with a weak atmospheric river will cause
widespread precipitation in the western U.S. through the first
half of next week. Precipitation is forecast for the Pacific
Northwest, northern Rockies, and especially northern California on
Sunday, which will spread southward into southern California
Monday and east into the Great Basin and Four Corners states on
Tuesday. Enhanced totals are likely along favored terrain, with
heavy mountain snow especially in the Sierra Nevada and portions
of the Rockies. Coastal rain is expected in California, and some
locally high rainfall rates causing flooding issues, especially
for sensitive burn scar areas, cannot be ruled out. Temperatures
will be near to somewhat below normal in the West underneath the
upper trough, with temperatures 10-20F below average for parts of
California and Nevada.

Farther east, the main story is increasing warmth in the central
and eastern U.S. through the period giving the strong ridging
aloft. Mild to warm temperatures about 10-20F above average begin
in the central U.S. Sunday, while temperatures should only
increase from there, reaching widespread 20+ and some locations
with 30+ temperature anomalies by Wednesday--currently forecast in
central parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley where highs could
reach into the 70s. Record warm minimum and maximum temperatures
are possible/likely from the Southern Plains to Great Lakes
region. Temperatures 10-20F above average are forecast to expand
into the Eastern Seaboard as well. Any widespread precipitation is
not likely in the central/eastern U.S. until next Wednesday as a
low pressure system comes into the Midwest, with snow possible in
the northern latitudes and rain possible along its trailing front,
but specific precipitation totals will have to be ironed out in
future forecast updates.

not likely in the central/eastern U.S. until next Wednesday as a
low pressure system comes into the Midwest, with snow possible in
the northern latitudes and rain possible along its trailing front,
but specific precipitation totals will have to be ironed out in
future forecast updates.

...Winter storm to produce the first widespread and significant
snow of the season throughout the Intermountain West and Central
Rockies today before spreading into the Great Plains and Upper
Midwest on Friday...

...Severe thunderstorms possible for parts of the Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio valleys on Friday night...

...Strong storm system to enter the Pacific Northwest on Friday
night...

...Record-breaking warmth to build across the south-central and
eastern United States through the beginning of this weekend...

Much of the active and potentially hazardous weather over the
Lower 48 during the short term will be associated with a
developing winter storm that is poised to produce a long
stretching swath of heavy snow from the Intermountain West to the
Upper Great Lakes. Light-to-moderate snow is expected to breakout
over the Sierra Nevada and Intermountain West this morning and
last into the evening hours. Additionally, cold air filtering from
the north will allow for snowflakes to fall into the lower
elevations of central Nevada and Utah, which could possibly lead
to dicey travel conditions. Snow is also forecast to spread into
the Central Rockies and parts of the central High Plains by
tonight as an upper-level trough swings eastward. Snowfall amounts
of 1-2 feet are forecast across the Rockies of western Colorado
and Utah, with widespread accumulations of 6-8 inches likely into
the Wyoming Front Range. As the system continues to progress
eastward on Friday, an area of low pressure is forecast to develop
over the Colorado Front Range and race northeast into the Midwest
by Friday night. As a result, a stripe of heavy snow is expected
to the north of the low and across parts of the Central/Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. Specifically, snowfall amounts greater
than 6 inches are likely to have fallen by Saturday morning along
the Nebraska-South Dakota border, northwest Iowa, southern
Minnesota, northern/central Wisconsin, and the U.P. of Michigan.
The combination of heavy snow and gusty winds will lead to
hazardous driving conditions throughout these regions. Given this
is the first widespread and significant snowfall of the season,
residents in these areas are urged to plan ahead and take proper
precautions if venturing out into the storm. Winter Storm
Warnings/Watches and Winter Weather Advisories have been issued.

The other aspect of this early-December winter storm will be found
along and ahead of a strong cold front forecast to reach the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley by Friday evening. It appears
probable that thunderstorms will turn severe from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to the Lower Ohio Valley into Friday night.
Damaging wind gusts and tornadoes are the main concern, with large
hail possible as well. Most of these thunderstorms are expected to
occur overnight, which can be particularly dangerous when
tornadoes are a possibility. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of Severe Weather from eastern
Arkansas and northwest Mississippi to far southern Indiana. Heavy
rain and isolated flooding concerns may also accompany the region.

Other areas of notable precipitation will be found across the
Upper Midwest/Great Lakes today and Pacific Northwest by Friday
night. Light snow and a wintry mix is likely to swing through
parts of Wisconsin and northern Michigan as a warm front nears the
region. A few inches of snow may accumulate and set the mood for
the approaching and aforementioned winter storm. Otherwise, after
a few scattered mountain snow showers and coastal rain showers
today, a strong cold front is forecast to reach western Washington
by Friday night. Gusty winds and heavy precipitation will be the
main impacts. Snowfall amounts over 2 feet are possible in the
Cascade and Olympic Mountains.

Meanwhile, winter is nowhere to be found throughout the
south-central U.S. with well above average temperatures set to
expand eastward over the next few day. Highs into the 70s and 80s
are expected in the Southern Plains today and Mid-South by Friday
ahead of the advancing cold front. These warm temperatures will
quickly build into the eastern U.S. by Saturday, where highs into
the 70s are possible as far north as southern New Jersey. Numerous
daily high temperature records are likely to break over the next
three days.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN GREAT BASIN INTO FOUR
CORNERS...

Only minor changes to the ongoing dry thunder areas.

Locally elevated dry/windy conditions remain possible across
northern/central Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and the U.P.
Observed, regional 12Z soundings indicate potential for dry
conditions this afternoon. A diffuse surface pressure gradient
should keep sustained winds mostly 10-15 mph, though stronger gusts
will be common. Late in the afternoon, a few thunderstorms may
develop in northwestern Minnesota along a secondary cold front.
Initial convection could be dry before quickly transitioning to
wetting storms as they progress southeastward.

..Wendt.. 06/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Widespread dry thunderstorms are expected today as mid-level
moisture seeps around the edges of an upper-level high anchored over
the Four Corners. Elevated and locally critical fire weather
conditions will be possible across the northern Rockies and upper
Midwest through the day ahead of increasing westerly flow aloft.

...Great Basin and Four Corners Dry Thunder...
Monsoonal flow around the periphery of the ridge across the
Southwest will support thunderstorm development from the Great Basin
eastward to the Four Corners and Colorado/New Mexico. Record heat
ongoing across the region will continue, with widespread surface
temperatures of 95-100+ F expected through the afternoon. The very
warm temperatures and dry surface conditions, RH less than 15%, will
increase evaporation potential, limiting precipitation from
thunderstorms. Dry thunderstorms appear likely, with the greatest
concentration expected along the higher terrain from eastern Utah
into western Colorado. While forcing for ascent will be relatively
weak, scattered storm coverage appears likely given robust buoyancy
profiles and abundant heating across the higher terrain. Fuels are
extremely susceptible to lightning starts given ongoing drought and
record heat. Critical dry thunderstorm probabilities will be
maintained through the forecast period.

...Colorado/Wyoming...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear likely
across portions of the Red Desert and northern Colorado this
afternoon and evening. Dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20% will
be in place within a very warm arimass with temperatures of 90-100+
F. While surface flow will be somewhat weak, west-southwesterly
surface winds of 10-15 mph, enhanced by thunderstorm outflow, will
be common through the afternoon. Given very dry fuel conditions and
the favorable meteorological circumstances, elevated to
near-critical fire weather conditions are likely.

...Western Minnesota...
A dry airmass will be advected into portions of the upper Midwest
tomorrow afternoon behind a departing cold front. While slightly
cooler than the preceding days, temperatures in the 80s F, with
decreasing surface moisture content, will favor dry boundary-layer
profiles supporting RH values near 25%. Northwest surface flow of
10-15 mph will be adequate for locally elevated fire weather
conditions through the afternoon, given widespread dry fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 18 2021

SYNOPSIS: Strong mid-level high pressure predicted over western North America
favors anomalously warm temperatures across the western half of the CONUS
throughout week-2, with an increased likelihood of excessive heat extending
from the Pacific Northwest to the Desert Southwest early in the period. There
continues to be good model support for the development of surface low pressure
during early week-2 to elevate the potential of heavy rainfall focused over
the
Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. An amplified mid-level pattern over the North
Pacific favors enhanced onshore flow to bring increased precipitation chances
over parts of the southern Alaska Mainland early in the period.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of Northern Intermountain region,
California, and the Great Basin, Sat-Sun, Jun 26-27.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the Northern Intermountain region, Pacific
Northwest, California, Great Basin, and the Desert Southwest, Sat-Mon, Jun
26-28.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the High
Plains, Sat-Fri, Jun 26-Jul 2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee
and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes, and the Appalachians, Sat-Mon, Jun 26-28.

Flooding possible for portions of southeastern Arkansas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tv2VaOQYWJ973ucBY17aYEY8NrxE6y1uFoo4nW3sm_gFnCtvCHIqw7aBhPzbw4vf5kdk1oLD$

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 26 - FRIDAY JULY 02: A more amplified 500-hPa height pattern
is featured in latest GEFS and ECMWF ensemble forecasts compared to yesterday
which is anticipated to increase hazard potential over the CONUS in today's
outlook. Over the northern Pacific, anomalous troughing continued to be
favored
over the Aleutians with downstream anomalous ridging overspreading the
northeastern Pacific and western North America. Notably, the predicted
positive
height center during early week-2 has shifted southward to southwestern Canada
and the Pacific Northwest in both the GEFS and ECMWF relative to previous
model
runs. Over the north-central CONUS, anomalous troughing remains likely to
develop during early week-2, where the ECMWF depicts a more southerly mean
trough axis than the GEFS across the Mississippi Valley by day 10 (Jun 28).
Downstream, amplified ridging centered over eastern Maritime Canada remains
favored by the dynamical models, as there is a larger coverage of positive
mid-level height departures overspreading the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic in
the
latest model runs by the middle portion of the period.



Tied to the amplified ridging aloft over western Northern America, the latest
reforecast guidance is indicative of an increased risk of excessive heat
throughout much of the western CONUS with the potential for record-breaking
temperatures over parts of California towards the end of June. Both the GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to depict a broad region covering much of
the western and central CONUS with at least a 20% chance maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile, and a slight risk of excessive heat remains
issued for the entirety of week-2. Compared to yesterday, there is a larger
coverage of probabilities exceeding 40% in both reforecast tools to support
the
expansion of the moderate risk area of excessive heat, which is now extended
from the Pacific Northwest to the Desert Southwest for Jun 26 to 28. Higher
probabilities (>60%) for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
and
95 degrees F exist over the central California Valley and western Nevada where
the National Blend of Models currently highlights several stations in northern
California which are expected to approach record-breaking temperatures.
Additionally, the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 40% chance of
maximum temperatures exceeding the 95th percentile and 100 degrees F over
portions of eastern Washington and northeastern Oregon suggestive of near
record breaking temperatures over this region for late June. Thus, two high
risk areas of excessive heat are added to the outlook for the respective
regions from Jun 26 to 27. Although temperatures are not anticipated to exceed
85 degrees along the Pacific coastline, areas near Seattle, Washington may
experience temperatures in the mid to upper 80's (deg F). There also remains
an
elevated potential for maximum temperatures exceeding 100 degrees F in parts
of
the Central and Southern High Plains, and 110 degrees F in the Desert
Southwest. Combined with below normal precipitation predominantly favored
across the western half of the CONUS during week-2, the anomalous heat is
expected to exacerbate moderate (D1) to exceptional (D4) drought conditions
being felt throughout many portions of the western CONUS. Across the eastern
U.S., reforecast guidance also shows elevated probabilities for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile over the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
tied to anomalous ridging aloft, however actual temperatures are not expected
to exceed 95 degrees F and no corresponding heat hazards are issued.



With amplified mid-level troughing favored to develop over the north-central
CONUS, there remains an increased potential for shortwave disturbances and
frontal activity to bring enhanced precipitation and potentially heavy
rainfall
east of the Great Plains. While both the GEFS and ECMWF depict surface low
development early in the period, they differ in regards to storm track with
the
latter favoring a more southerly mean solution across the Ohio Valley. This is
reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool which shows an expanded coverage of
increased probabilities over the Tennessee Valley for 3-day precipitation
totals to exceed the 85th percentile and 1 inch early in the period, and a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is expanded to include this region as well
as the Appalachians from Jun 26 to 28. As the surface low shifts is expected
to
move eastward with time, enhanced precipitation remains likely over the
eastern
U.S, however these rainfall amounts are not anticipated to exceed hazard
thresholds.



Farther south, the National Hurricane Center has upgraded the tropical
disturbance in the Gulf of Mexico to Potential Tropical Cyclone Three since
yesterday. Regardless of further development, this system is currently
forecast
to continue tracking northward towards the central Gulf Coast states, where
the
Weather Prediction Center forecasts 5-10 inches of rainfall over southeastern
Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama, and the western Florida
Panhandle through the end of week-1. River flooding remains a concern across
the Gulf states during week-2, where antecedent heavy rainfall and soil
moisture content registering in the highest percentiles supports the
continuation of a flooding possible hazard highlighted mainly over the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys and the Southeast.



Over Alaska, the amplified mid-level pattern forecast across the North Pacific
is expected to enhance onshore flow early in the period. With surface low
pressure also forecast, enhanced precipitation and increased wind speeds are
likely across the Southern Mainland and the Aleutians. However, reforecast
tools remain unsupportive of precipitation and winds reaching hazard
thresholds.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FOUR CORNERS VICINITY...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. There is potential for locally
elevated conditions to develop in the immediate lee of the Coastal
Ranges in southern/central California as a thermal pressure trough
develops in the Central Valley. Lacking mid-level wind support will
keep concerns localized.

..Wendt.. 06/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CDT Fri Jun 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
Stagnant high pressure across the Four Corners will remain in place
as increasing mid-level flow ahead of shortwave trough passes
through the northern Rockies. Widespread dry thunderstorms are
expected across the Great Basin and Southwest beneath the ridge,
where very warm and dry surface conditions are forecast. Elevated to
near-critical fire weather potential will exist across Idaho and
into Montana/Wyoming, where gusty winds and low humidity are
expected.

...The Four Corners into the eastern Great Basin...
Around the periphery of the upper ridge, mid-level moisture will
support thunderstorm development by early Afternoon from eastern
Nevada into portion of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona. A
very warm and well-mixed boundary layer, with temperatures near or
exceeding 100 F, will limit precipitation potential across much of
the Southwest. Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible across
much of the region atop very dry and receptive fuels.

The most likely corridor for widespread dry thunderstorms will be
from the high terrain of western New Mexico, through the Four
Corners, and into western Colorado and eastern Utah. Here, very
dry/warm surface conditions will coexist with sufficient mid-level
moisture (PWATs 0.45-0.6 inches) for scattered thunderstorm
development. Model soundings depict an environment highly favorable
for charge separation and lightning development, with 500-1000 J/kg
of MUCAPE concentrated above the 0C layer. High-resolution guidance
shows several clusters of storms developing off the higher terrain
and tracking slowly east by mid afternoon. High confidence exists in
scattered dry storm development over fuels very susceptible to
lightning starts.

...Snake River Valley...
Ahead of the increasing northwest flow aloft, dry westerly flow of
10-20 mph is forecast to develop down the Snake River valley
Day2/Saturday overlapping with RH of 15-20%. Lower and mid-elevation
fuels drier than average support fire spread suggesting
elevated/locally critical fire weather conditions are possible.

...Wyoming and Montana...
To the north of the mid-level ridge, stronger northwesterly flow
aloft is forecast to develop through Day2/Saturday ahead of a
shortwave trough. Westerly flow will move downslope across central
and eastern Wyoming supporting dry surface conditions with RH neat
20%. Warm temperatures, dry surface conditions and gusty winds
suggest elevated fire weather conditions are likely.

Farther to the north across Montana, lee troughing will intensify
during the day ahead of a dry cold front sweeping through the
northern Rockies. Increasing west-east surface pressure gradients
will enhance northwesterly surface winds across much of southeastern
Montana through the evening. Downslope trajectories and warm surface
temperatures should result in a dry airmass with RH below 20%. The
overlap of gusty surface winds near 20 mph and a dry boundary layer
will support elevated to near critical fire weather conditions.

Valid 12Z Mon Jun 21 2021 - 12Z Fri Jun 25 2021

...Heat intensifies over the interior Northwest then spreads to
the Plains next week...
...Wet tropical remnants of "Three" exits the Carolinas Monday
then off the East Coast...
...Trailing frontal heavy rains across the South to the East Coast
early next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance this morning is in fairly good agreement on the overall
evolution of the synoptic pattern across the U.S. through the
medium-range period.  A general blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean,
06Z GFS/GEFS, and the 00Z CMC/CMC mean yielded solutions that
agree very well with WPC continuity.

The ECMWF and UKmet continue to predict a much better-defined
circulation associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone "Three"
than the GFS as it is forecast to exit the Carolinas into the
Atlantic on Monday.  There is a general model trend to push the
cold front faster through the eastern U.S. by next Tuesday.
Toward the latter part of next week, there appears to be emerging
model tendency for overrunning rain/convection to track across the
Midwest ahead of a warm front.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat over the
Southwest/California is expected to moderate by the middle of next
week, as temperatures are is forecast to return to near or
slightly below normal for these areas.  However, heat is expected
to intensify early next week from the interior Northwest to the
northern part of the Great Basin toward the northern/central
Rockies, before spreading into the northern and central Plains by
the middle of next week, and may continue into late next week.

Meanwhile, Potential Tropical Cyclone "Three" is forecast by the
NHC to track inland across the lower Mississippi Valley this
weekend.  The remnants of the system is expected to bring a period
enhanced rainfall across the Carolinas on Monday before tracking
northeastward off the East Coast as mainly a maritime threat.
Early next week upper support, frontal approach and Gulf
moisture/instability return in the wake of the tropical system
will support periods of strong convection with heavy downpours
across the already wet South that would lead to additional runoff
issues, especially with lead training. Generally progressive
frontal focusing rains will then spread through the Ohio Valley,
Appalachians and the Eastern Seaboard, lingering over the
Southeast/Florida midweek with the trailing front.

Upstream, additional digging upper energies and return frontal
support may combine to favor a moderate convective rain focus from
the eastern Plains and north-central Mid-Mississippi
Valley/Midwest later next week ahead of a warm front.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri June 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 24 - 28 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and a ridge with above normal
500-hPa heights over the eastern Gulf of Alaska, extending to the western
CONUS. Downstream an enhanced trough is predicted over the east-central CONUS
with below normal 500-hPa heights.

The predicted troughing over the Aleutians and the associated potential storm
system development is expected to bring more clouds, and therefore
probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored over southeastern
Mainland Alaska and parts of the Alaska Panhandle. Southerly to southwesterly
flow favors relatively warm conditions for northern Mainland Alaska. A
predicted trough over the east-central CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of
near to below normal temperatures across most of the central and eastern
CONUS.
Above normal temperatures are also likely over much of the western CONUS, the
Southern Plains and parts of the Northeast, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the Aleutians favors above normal
precipitation over the Aleutians,much of Mainland Alaska, and parts of the
Alaska Panhandle. Anomalous ridging and northerly flow increase chances of
near
to below normal precipitation across the western CONUS, High Plains and
Southern Plains.  Predicted troughing over the east-central CONUS favors near
to above normal precipitation across most of the Upper and Middle Mississippi
Valley, and the eastern CONUS consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast
tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 26 - JUL 02, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS while remaining amplified over the Northern Pacific as
ensemble spread and uncertainty increase.

Below normal temperatures are favored for much of central and southeastern
Mainland Alaska, associated with a mean trough over the Aleutians and
potential
storm systems developing to bring more clouds. Near to above normal
temperatures are likely over the western half of the CONUS, and the Northeast,
under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal temperatures are
mostly favored over the remainder eastern half of the CONUS, as a trough and
storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The above normal precipitation probability is enhanced over northern Mainland
Alaska due to forecast troughing over the Aleutians. Near to below normal
precipitation odds are increased for the Alaska Panhandle and most of the
western CONUS as well as the Southern Plains, associated with mean ridging
over
the eastern Gulf of Alaska and the western CONUS. Near to above normal
precipitation is favored across parts of the central and eastern CONUS,
consistent with the ERF consolidation tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

Valid 00Z Sat Jun 19 2021 - 00Z Mon Jun 21 2021

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding are likely throughout
the Ohio Valley and Midwest this evening...

...Tropical downpours and an increasing threat for dangerous flash
flooding will spread into the Central Gulf Coast region this
evening and into portions of the Southeast this weekend...

...A long-duration heat wave will continue across a large portion
of the western United States...

Much of the Ohio Valley and into sections of the Midwest could see
damaging thunderstorms and flash flooding this evening/overnight.
A slow moving cold front draped across the Great Lakes and into
the Central Plains will be the focus for thunderstorm activity.
Warm temperatures and an abundance of atmospheric moisture will
lead to potent thunderstorms and the capability of intense
rainfall rates. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced
Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather from southern Iowa to Ohio.
Damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes will be the main
concern across the Ohio Valley, with large hail most likely to
impact parts of the Midwest near southern Iowa and northern
Illinois. Meanwhile, multiple rounds of heavy rain and downpours
are likely to lead to flash flooding concerns overnight between
southern Indiana to southern/central Ohio. WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall throughout this
region due to multiple inches of rain possible in a very short
amount of time. This threat of severe thunderstorms and heavy rain
will drastically decrease on Saturday, but isolated showers and
thunderstorms are still expected between the Ohio Valley and
Northeast.

Farther south, a low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico
(currently labeled as Potential Tropical Cyclone Three) is
forecast to slowly push northward and into the Central Gulf Coast
tonight. The biggest impacts with this system will be associated
with heavy rain and flash flooding. Rainfall totals of 4 to 8
inches with isolated maximum amounts of 12 inches are possible
between eastern Louisiana and the western Florida Panhandle. This
amount of rain will likely lead to considerable flash, urban, and
small stream flooding impacts, as well as new and renewed minor to
isolated moderate river flooding. Once the system lifts into the
southeastern U.S. this weekend, rainfall amounts of 3 to 5 inches
with isolated maximum amounts of 7 inches are possible. WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall for tonight across
coastal sections of southeast Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
A Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall also exists on Saturday
throughout central/southern Alabama and portions of
western/central Georgia. A few isolated tornadoes are possible
across southern Alabama and the Florida Panhandle on Saturday as
well. By Sunday, much of the associated impacts will lessen and
spread into the Carolinas.

An oppressive, dangerous, and long-duration heat wave will
continue through at least the beginning of the weekend in the
West. Well above and potentially record-breaking temperatures will
be found throughout the Southwest, California, and Central Great
Basin this evening and Saturday. By Sunday, temperatures begin to
relax slightly, but will still remain above average. Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are still in effect across much
of California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and sections of western
Colorado and northern New Mexico. Red Flag Warnings have also been
issued in order to highlight the fire danger associated with the
ongoing heat and extremely dry soils.

Elsewhere, above average temperatures and summer heat will be felt
throughout the central/southern Plains and Middle Mississippi
Valley this weekend ahead of an approaching cold front. This same
frontal boundary will fuel numerous showers and thunderstorms
across the northern/central Plains on Saturday and Upper Midwest
by Sunday. A few thunderstorms could turn severe in the central
High Plains on Saturday. Behind the cold front, cool and pleasant
temperatures will rush into the north-central United States.

514 PM EDT Fri Jun 18 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Jun 21 2021 - 12Z Fri Jun 25 2021

...Heat intensifies over the interior Northwest then spreads to the Plains
next week...
...Wet tropical remnants of "Three" exits the Carolinas Monday then off the
East Coast...
...Trailing frontal heavy rains across the South to the East Coast early next
week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance this morning is in fairly good agreement on the overall evolution of
the synoptic pattern across the U.S. through the medium-range period.  A
general blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, and the 00Z CMC/CMC mean
yielded solutions that agree very well with WPC continuity.

The ECMWF, UKmet, and more recently the CMC, continue to predict a much
better-defined circulation associated with Potential Tropical Cyclone "Three"
than the GFS as it is forecast to exit the Carolinas into the Atlantic on
Monday.  There is a general model trend to push the cold front faster through
the eastern U.S. by next Tuesday.  Toward the latter part of next week, there
appears to be emerging model tendency for overrunning rain/convection to track
across the Midwest ahead of a warm front.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat over the Southwest/California is
expected to moderate by the middle of next week, as temperatures are forecast
to return to near or slightly below normal for these areas.  However, heat is
expected to intensify early next week from the interior Northwest to the
northern part of the Great Basin toward the northern/central Rockies, before
spreading into the northern and central Plains by the middle of next week,
which may continue into late next week.

Meanwhile, Potential Tropical Cyclone "Three" is forecast by the NHC to track
inland across the lower Mississippi Valley this weekend.  The remnants of the
system are expected to bring a period enhanced rainfall across the Carolinas
on Monday before tracking northeastward off the East Coast as mainly a
maritime threat.  Early next week upper support, frontal approach and Gulf
moisture/instability return in the wake of the tropical system will support
periods of strong convection with heavy downpours across the already wet South
that would lead to additional runoff issues, especially with lead training.
Generally progressive frontal focusing rains will then spread through the Ohio
Valley, Appalachians and the Eastern Seaboard, lingering over the Southeast/
Florida midweek with the trailing front.

Upstream, additional digging upper energies and return frontal support may
combine to favor a moderate convective rain focus from the eastern Plains and
north-central Mid-Mississippi Valley/Midwest later next week ahead of a warm
front.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
231 AM EDT Sat Jun 19 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 22 2021 - 12Z Sat Jun 26 2021

...Heat intensifies from the interior Northwest to the Plains next
week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

A composite blend of well clustered model solutions of the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian seem to offer a good basis for
the day 3-5 (Tuesday-Thursday) forecast period in a pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Model continuity
begins to suffer into days 6/7 and the WPC product suite was
instead mainly derived from still compatible GEFS/NAEFS/ECENS
means and National Blend of Models in a period with slowly growing
forecast spread and uncertainty. 00 UTC guidance remains in line.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record-breaking and dangerous heat now over the
Southwest/California is expected to return to seasonal next week.
However, heat will intensify from the interior Northwest to the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and Plains where some record
values may build.

In the wake of wet "Three", well organized convective rains and
lingering runoff issues are expected for the Gulf Coast states and
the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday with frontal passage. Some activity
will linger over the Southeast/Florida into later next week with
the stalling front. Digging upper energy, instability and frontal
support upstream may combine to favor an emerging late week strong
convection/rain threat for the Midwest.

...Heat intensifies from the interior Northwest to the Plains next
week...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

A composite blend of well clustered model solutions of the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian seem to offer a good basis for
the day 3-5 (Tuesday-Thursday) forecast period in a pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Model continuity
begins to suffer into days 6/7 and the WPC product suite was
instead mainly derived from still compatible GEFS/NAEFS/ECENS
means and National Blend of Models in a period with slowly growing
forecast spread and uncertainty. 00 UTC guidance remains in line.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record-breaking and dangerous heat now over the
Southwest/California is expected to return to seasonal next week.
However, heat will intensify from the interior Northwest to the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and Plains where some record
values may build.

In the wake of wet "Three", well organized convective rains and
lingering runoff issues are expected for the Gulf Coast states and
the Eastern Seaboard Tuesday with frontal passage. Some activity
will linger over the Southeast/Florida into later next week with
the stalling front. Digging upper energy, instability and frontal
support upstream may combine to favor an emerging late week strong
convection/rain threat for the Midwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0150 AM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS AND WESTERN
SLOPE...

...Synopsis...
Ridging across the Southwest will remain in place while a shortwave
trough develops southward into the northern Rockies this evening.
Increasing northwesterly flow aloft will spread a dry airmass across
the northern and central Rockies, while widespread dry thunderstorms
are expected near the Four Corners.

...Four Corners and Western Slope Dry Thunder...
Mid-level ridging centered over the Four Corners will remain
dominate across the Southwest through the day. Around the upper
high, moist southerly mid-level flow is forecast to continue
advecting moisture northward into the southern Rockies. Strong
diurnal heating and the glancing influence of the northern US trough
will support widespread shower and thunderstorm development from mid
morning through early evening. Dry sub-cloud layers with RH below
20% are likely, suggesting storms will be high-based. With little
precipitation expected, scattered dry lightning strikes appear
likely. The corridor of greatest activity appears to be from central
and western Colorado toward eastern Utah. Given very receptive fuels
and expected storm coverage, scattered dry thunder probabilities
will be maintained.

...Snake River Valley...
Northwest flow aloft ahead of shortwave trough across the northern
Rockies will enhance westerly surface winds to around 15 mph through
southern Idaho. Warm and dry surface conditions with RH of 10-20%
developing during the day will support elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions.

...Wyoming and Montana...
Increasing flow aloft associated with the aforementioned Rockies
shortwave will result in westerly downslope flow across much of
Wyoming and eastern Montana. Weak lee cyclogenesis is forecast
across eastern Montana this afternoon, enhancing surface winds to
around 15-20 mph. Through the afternoon, a warm and well-mixed
boundary layer with RH below 20% will overlap with fuels supporting
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions. A dry cold
front will move in from the northwest later in the evening, bringing
a shift to northwesterly flow and gradually decreasing wind speeds
after dark.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 19 2021

Valid 201200Z - 211200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging across the Southwest will yield under the
influence of a deepening trough over the upper Midwest as northwest
flow aloft increases. At the surface, a cold front will shift east
out of the Rockies into the central Plains. Dry northwesterly flow
will support elevated fire weather conditions through much of the
southern Rockies and Southwest.

...Southwest and Southern Rockies...
As the trough across the northern US deepens Day2/Sunday, mid-level
ridging will weaken and shift to the south and west through the day.
Increasing northwesterly flow aloft will overspread much of the
Great Basin and southern Rockies supporting gusty surface winds of
15-20 mph. Surface conditions will remain warm and dry, with daytime
highs in the 80s and 90s F and widespread RH below 20%. Receptive
fuels and recent lightning activity suggest elevated fire weather
conditions will be likely. The lack of stronger forcing aloft should
limit greater surface winds to local enhancement from terrain.
Widespread critical fire weather conditions appear unlikely, though
small pockets will likely exist where local fuel and meteorological
conditions overlap.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central High Plains to the Ohio Valley, the Lower Great Lakes,
and over parts of the Central Gulf Coast with Potential Tropical
Cyclone THREE through Sunday morning...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and the
Southern Appalachians with Potential Tropical Cyclone THREE
through Sunday morning...

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat will continue across a large
portion of the western U.S....

Heatwave continues. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories
remain in effect across much of California, Nevada, Arizona, and
Utah. Temperatures are expected to once again reach
record-breaking highs across much of the region, with several
records likely to fall on Saturday.  Additionally, Heat Advisories
are also in effect for portions of California and Nevada on
Saturday.  Well-above normal temperatures are expected across the
region, with record-breaking highs expected over parts of
California, Nevada, and Arizona.  While a front dropping into the
region on Monday is expected to offer some relief, temperatures
are forecast to remain well above average on Saturday.

Severe thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of a front that
extends from the Great Lakes roughly southwestward to the Central
High Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk
of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Central High Plains to
the Ohio Valley and the Lower Great Lakes through Sunday morning.
The main hazards with these storms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gust, large hail, and a few tornadoes. There is
a 10% or greater probability of wind gust of 65 knots or greater
over parts of the Central High Plains.

Meanwhile, Potential Tropical Cyclone THREE will impact parts of
the Central Gulf Coast, Tennessee Valley, Southeast, and the
Southern Appalachians with heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the region. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Sunday morning. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over parts of the Central Gulf Coast with Potential Tropical
Cyclone THREE through Sunday morning. The main hazards with these
storms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust,
large hail, and a few tornadoes.  Check the latest advisory from
the National Hurricane Center for strength and track of Potential
Tropical Cyclone THREE.

A developing wave of low pressure over the Midwest will move
northeastward to the Great Lakes with a trailing front by Sunday
evening.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead
of the boundary over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley into
parts of the Great Lakes.  The Storm Prediction Center has issued
a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the area on Sunday into
Monday morning. Additionally, Potential Tropical Cyclone THREE
will continue to produce heavy rain over parts of the Southeast
and Southern Appalachians on Sunday into Monday.  The WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these downpours.
The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of
flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams are the
most vulnerable on Sunday into Monday morning. Elsewhere, Red Flag
Warnings have also been issued over parts of the Rockies and the
Great Basin to highlight the fire danger associated with the
ongoing heat and arid soils.

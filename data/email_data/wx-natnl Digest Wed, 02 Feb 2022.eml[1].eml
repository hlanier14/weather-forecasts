NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1027 AM CST Tue Feb 01 2022

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fire weather conditions appear unlikely across the CONUS today. See
the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 02/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0112 AM CST Tue Feb 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough will amplify through the day while
impinging on the central U.S. At the surface, a cold front will
drift southward across the Plains states, accompanied by cold/wintry
conditions. Ahead of the surface cold front/lee trough, downslope
westerly winds will usher in modestly dry air into western Texas
this afternoon. However, overall weaker surface wind speeds preclude
any fire weather highlights.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 PM CST Tue Feb 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes have been made to the current outlook. See the prior
discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 02/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CST Tue Feb 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will eject into the Plains states
tomorrow/Wednesday, further driving a surface cold front into the
Gulf of Mexico. Behind the cold front, cold/wintry weather is
expected across the central and southern Plains, limiting wildfire
concerns. Strong, dry offshore flow is also expected tomorrow across
southern California. While Critical meteorological surface
conditions are expected to be in place, fuels remain too moist to
support significant wildfire-spread potential, with no fire weather
highlights introduced.

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 09 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 15: A mid-level shortwave trou=
gh,
in the northern stream, supports a slight risk of heavy snow across the
northern Rockies from Feb 9 to 11. During the remainder of week-2, the
uncalibrated ECMWF model depicts much lower probabilities that precipitatio=
n
amounts would exceed 0.5 inch, liquid equivalent. Therefore, the heavy snow
hazard is discontinued after Feb 11. The shortwave trough is expected to
promote surface low development across southern Canada with downsloping flo=
w
affecting the northern Great Plains. Based on this predicted surface flow a=
nd
reforecast wind tools, a slight risk of high winds is posted for the northe=
rn
Great Plains from Feb 9 to 11.



Southwest flow aloft associated with a positively-tilted longwave trough
favors
near to above normal precipitation across the Southern Great Plains,
Southeast,
and Mid-Atlantic during week-2. Based on good model agreement indicating a
shortwave trough in the southern stream and support from the uncalibrated
ECMWF
model, a slight risk of heavy precipitation (more than 1 inch per 24 hours)=
 is
posted from the western Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi Valley eastward to
the
southern Appalachians from Feb 10 to 13. Given the time of year, the northe=
rn
extent of this precipitation poses a risk for winter weather hazards,
especially across the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and Mid-Atlantic. However,
continued uncertainty on precipitation amounts to the north and indications
that temperatures may become more marginal, a heavy snow hazard is not post=
ed
at this time.



Model solutions continue to differ today regarding the magnitude of below
normal temperature anomalies, if any, to affect the central and eastern CON=
US
later in week-2, with the GEFS colder than the ECMWF ensemble mean. Given t=
he
lack of a full latitude ridge upstream and absence of cross-polar surface f=
low
at the higher latitudes, the milder temperature solution of the ECMWF ensem=
ble
mean is preferred.



There is good model agreement and continuity regarding a persistent, longwa=
ve
500-hPa trough over the Aleutians and Bering Sea from week-1 into the
beginning
of week-2. This pattern is likely to support a continuation of surface low
development near the Aleutians or Alaska Peninsula with enhanced onshore fl=
ow
affecting coastal southern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Based on predic=
ted
surface flow and 24-hour precipitation amounts from ensemble means, a sligh=
t
risk of heavy precipitation (more than 2 inches, liquid equivalent) and hig=
h
winds (excess of 40mph) is maintained for coastal southeastern Alaska and t=
he
northern Alaska Panhandle on Feb 9. Beyond that time, an increase in 500-hP=
a
heights and weakening onshore flow are expected to rapidly lower the chance=
s
of
heavy precipitation and high winds.

...Lingering Snow/Ice Threat exits the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
Friday...

...Overview...

A positively tilted and reinforced mean trough aloft should hold
strong across much of the CONUS through the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday), as strong upper riding builds over both the
western Atlantic and the eastern Pacific (and periodically
extending into parts of the west). On Friday, a shortwave moving
through the Northeast will drive a potent cold front off the East
coast, with potentially heavy wintry precip likely coming to an
end on the north side of this system. Into this weekend,
uncertainty begins to increase over details of additional
shortwaves dropping down the east side of the ridge in the West as
well as a series of northern stream shortwaves which should
support a train of northern tier waves into early next week. Upper
troughing into the East early next week may induce wintry coastal
waves, with some signal for additional development of any in a
series of lows.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles provide a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution through medium range time scales, but present
significant run to run variance with smaller scale embedded upper
impulses and surface wave reflections and local QPF focus. Prefer
a composite of the otherwise decently clustered solutions of the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian models for days 3/4 (Fri/Sat) before
transitioning to the still compatible GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means by
days 6/7 to minimize the less predictable forecast components.
This provides a good forecast basis along with the 13 UTC National
Blend of Models and WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Troughing into the East on Friday and a leading wavy cold front
through the East will continue the threat for lingering
significant snow/ice from the Mid-Atlantic to especially southern
New England. Lingering moderate to locally heavy showers are still
possible across parts of the Southeast along the trailing front
Friday with periodic additional activity through the weekend into
early next week with additional frontal waves/upper impulses.

Elsewhere, northern tier systems may produce secondary shots of
cold air into the central U.S.,but only light, scattered snow over
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes. Mostly light rain/mountain snow
should accompany a couple systems brushing the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies. Significant guidance differences with
separate streams of energy aloft lead to low confidence in the
coverage and amounts of precipitation over the South and East from
the weekend into early next week. Ambient cold air offers the
potential for some swaths of wintry weather on the northern
periphery of these uncertain precipitation areas, with best bet
Sunday over the Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic.

Arctic high pressure settling from the central to eastern U.S.
behind the front will bring very cold temps later this week into
the weekend. Anomalies may be most profound for parts of the
southern Plains with values 15-25 degrees below normal possible.
Upper ridging trying to build across the northern/central Plains
Monday-Tuesday of next week could bring a period of much above
normal temperatures to this region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0113 AM CST Wed Feb 02 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough will eject into the Plains states today,
reinforcing the southward surge of cold and/or wintry conditions
across the central and southern CONUS, limiting the threat for
wildfire development. Critical meteorological surface conditions are
expected to accompany a strong offshore flow event across southern
California, as surface high pressure intensifies across the Interior
West. However, fuels remain poorly receptive to fire spread across
southern California, precluding fire weather highlights.

...An ongoing significant winter storm will impact much of the
central and northeastern U.S. through Thursday morning...

...A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding
is in effect for portions of the Southeast and Lower Mississippi
Valley on Thursday...

...Arctic air surges south through central U.S.; East Coast warms
up...

An amplified upper-level trough will power a dangerous winter
storm across the central and northeastern parts of the country
over the next couple of days.This winter storm will bring a
variety of winter weather hazards, including heavy snow, sleet,
and freezing rain. The system will be prolonged with several
rounds of winter weather lasting through Thursday for portions of
the central U.S. before shifting to the interior Northeast. Heavy
snow is expected over the Southern Rockies and from the
Southern/Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley through
the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Interior Northeast. A corridor of
heavy ice (rain/freezing rain) accumulation is likely from Texas
through the Ohio River Valley. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings
are in effect for much of the areas to be affected by heavy snow
and ice. In addition, the combination of snow and ice may cause
hazardous road conditions. Plan now for prolonged hazardous winter
weather conditions and disrupted travel.

Locations impacted by snow and or ice are expected to have
temperatures remain below freezing and well below average for at
least a couple of days after the wintry precipitation ends. The
cold temperatures will be due to the emergence of arctic high
pressure, which will descend over the Plains on Wednesday. This
high pressure will send very frigid air down through the Plains
between today and Friday. As a result, high temperatures for many
places across the Plains will be between 15-25 degrees below
average during this period. The eastern third of the country will
warm up a bit out ahead of the cold front associated with the
winter storm. Temperatures will moderate upon the passage of the
cold front on Friday night.

Additionally, moderate to heavy rainfall may develop within the
warm sector of this dynamic system, i.e., from the Southern Plains
to the Northeast. Scattered to isolated thunderstorms may develop
across the Central Gulf Coast tonight. A Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall leading to flash flooding is in effect for this area due
to the potential for some thunderstorms to produce locally heavy
rainfall. Elsewhere, upper-level energy and weak onshore flow will
aid in producing coastal rain and higher elevation snow over the
Pacific Northwest and light snow over the Northern Intermountain
Region into the Northern/Central Rockies through Thursday.

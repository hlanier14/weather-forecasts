...Potential Heavy Rain Threat for Western Gulf Region Late This
Weekend and Early Next Week...

...Overview...

Fast, quasi-zonal flow across the northern tier of the U.S. will
keep the majority of the CONUS in a drier weather pattern. A
tropical disturbance that may emerge into the western Gulf late
this weekend into early next week does pose a potential heavy rain
threat for portions of the Texas and southern Louisiana coasts.
Temperatures will generally be near to below normal across the
northern tier north of the front and near the Gulf, but warmer
than normal in between from the Southwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Faster, quasi zonal flow that is expected to setup across the
CONUS over the course of the medium range period and the latest
model guidance continues to struggle with that evolution.
Particularly noted as an outlier and therefore not included in the
WPC model blend preferences was the 00Z/06Z runs of the GFS where
were initially too fast with the trough progression on day 3/4 and
then become nearly out of phase with other deterministic models
and associated ensemble means with another approaching shortwave
energy late in the period. Once that timing difference starts, it
expands through the period rendering an all-encompassing blend
ineffectual. For now, a non-GFS blend was preferred which
transitions well from continuity and favors more of the ensemble
support.

For the western Gulf, a broad tropical plume associated with a
weak disturbance will gradually lift northwest toward the TX/LA
coasts late Sunday into early/middle of next week. There is
considerable uncertainty in the potential strength, development,
and track of this feature but the latest guidance is in reasonable
agreement for the potential of heavy rainfall along the immediate
coasts that could reach several inches or more over the multi-day
period. Interests in these areas should continue to monitor the
latest forecasts.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana Gulf coasts. Several
inches appear possible and this could lead to some flooding
concerns. Otherwise, frontal boundaries slipping through the flow
across the central and northern U.S. will bring mostly lighter
rainfall amounts to portions of the CONUS with some potential for
isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts. Temperatures will
largely be below normal across the northern tier with swings above
normal ahead of frontal passages across the central/eastern U.S..
Readings on Sunday and Monday could top 10-15F above normal across
the Central Plains to lower Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes.

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN IDAHO AND
SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND
SOUTHEASTERN OREGON...

...Scattered Dry Thunderstorms...
12z hi-res guidance continues to show the development of widely
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon across central and southern
Oregon ahead of a strengthening shortwave trough. The 12z MFR
observed sounding showed 400 J/kg of MUCAPE, which is substantially
higher than previous model soundings had estimated. Along with
convective trends noted with an ongoing band of mid-level cumulus
northeast of Medford, Oregon, confidence is increasing in the
potential for scattered lightning coverage over very dry fuels in
eastern Oregon and far western Idaho.

Later in the forecast period, a second band of convection is
forecast  to develop ahead of a cold front moving ashore after 06z.
Hi-res guidance is less confident on the strength of these storms
due to limited nocturnal buoyancy. However, as the trough becomes
negatively tilted overnight, strong forcing for ascent will likely
bolster low-level updrafts along the cold front supporting the
potential for additional lightning strikes across northern
California and southern Oregon overnight. The very dry sub-cloud
layer will support little initial precipitation as the column slowly
saturates. This strongly suggests any lightning activity will likely
be dry in nature before better wetting rain potential develops. As
such, scattered dry thunderstorm probabilities will be maintained
across the region with only minor adjustments to the latest
guidance.

..Lyons.. 09/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Thu Sep 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active fire weather day appears likely across portions of the
Interior west this afternoon through tonight, as the upper ridge
over the region begins to break down and a mid-level trough impinges
on the West Coast. Widespread 35-50 kts of 500 mb flow will pivot
around the interior-West upper anticyclone and support dry and
breezy conditions conducive to fire spread across portions of the
western Great Basin northeastward to the northern High Plains.
Deep-layer ascent associated with the approaching upper trough will
also support isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the western
Great Basin and portions of the Pacific Northwest into the northern
Rockies. Several fire starts will be possible where thunderstorms
occur given the extremely dry fuels in place.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A plume of mid-level moisture will continue to spread northwest
across the western Great Basin, Pacific Northwest, and northern
Rockies through the day. Daytime heating of the boundary layer,
along with gradually increasing deep-layer ascent with the
approaching upper trough, will serve to initiate thunderstorms by
21Z. Thereafter, storm coverage will increase within the 00-06Z time
frame. Precipitable water values from central Nevada northwestward
to central Oregon and eastward to south-central Montana are expected
to peak in the 0.6-0.9 inch range. Classic inverted-V vertical
profiles extending up to 700-500 mb in forecast soundings suggest
high-based, dry thunderstorm modes. Isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights have been added where at least a couple thunderstorms are
expected to form from 21Z onward to the end of the period (12Z
Friday morning).

Of particular concern is a region from central Oregon into far
northern California within the 21-06Z period, where high-resolution
guidance consensus depicts a denser cluster of dry thunderstorms
moving across the region. Fast-moving storms atop a deep, dry
boundary layer will overspread an area characterized by record dry
fuels. As such, several lightning-induced fire ignitions/holdovers
may be associated with this round of storms. This may especially be
the case if subsequent rounds of storms/wetting rainfall late Day 1
into Day 2 end up occurring farther north than anticipated.
Scattered dry thunderstorm highlights have been introduced to
account for this scenario.

...Dry and Windy Conditions...
A dry, well-mixed boundary layer is expected to develop across much
of the interior West into the northern High Plains by afternoon peak
heating. The downward momentum transport of the stronger mid-level
flow, along with downslope flow along the lee of terrain-favoring
areas, will foster 15-25 mph sustained westerly winds coinciding
with 15-20% RH across a broad region of the West. Elevated
highlights have been maintained across parts of the western Great
Basin, into the Pacific Northwest, northern and central Rockies, and
northern High Plains, where confidence is highest in the
aforementioned surface winds/RH overlapping for at least a few hours
this afternoon into early evening.

The best chance for Critical conditions will be across northeast
Idaho into far southwest Montana. Here, downslope flow along the
Sawtooth Range, and downward momentum transport of the strongest
flow within the core of a 500 mb wind maximum, will support 20+ mph
sustained winds overlapping with 15% RH for at least a few hours.
Elsewhere within the Elevated delineation, at least locally Critical
conditions appear likely across portions of central Nevada, as well
as across portions of central into eastern Montana. However,
guidance suggests that the most favorable surface winds/RH overlap
will remain too localized and brief to warrant Critical highlights.

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 17 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 23: Dynamical models continue =
to
favor the development of an amplified 500-hPa trough-ridge pattern over the
CONUS by next weekend. There is good agreement between the GEFS and the ECM=
WF
ensemble means featuring anomalous mid-level troughing shifting south from
Alaska, with negative height departures overspreading the higher latitudes =
of
North America. While the ECMWF features a more amplified pattern than the
GEFS,
consistent with yesterday's guidance, this morning's 0z ECMWF ensemble mean
reveals a trough axis extending further south along the West Coast and a
broader coverage of anomalous troughing into the Northern High Plains early=
 in
the outlook period. Regardless of these differences, the predicted mid-leve=
l
pattern transition is anticipated to bring a period of cooler temperatures,=
 an
elevated potential for high winds, and enhanced onshore flow to increase
precipitation chances over western North America during week-2.



Surface low pressure remains favored to develop over the Canadian Prairies,
advecting anomalously cold air into the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies
and
the Northern Plains early in the period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
highlight parts of these areas with at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and 40 degrees F, supporting
the
continuation of a slight risk of much below normal temperatures. Difference=
s
exist between the reforecast tools in regards to the duration of the cold
signal, with the ECMWF (GEFS) maintaining these elevated probabilities thro=
ugh
the middle (early) part of the period. To address the potential for prolong=
ed
cold, the slight risk area for much below normal temperatures is extended
through day 10 (Sep 19) and is expanded eastward to include the Northern
Plains
where anomalously cold temperatures may lead to early season frost and free=
zes
to impact vegetation in the region. Tied to this surface low, ensemble
guidance
also favors the potential for strong surface pressure gradients and elevate=
d
wind speeds across the Northern Intermountain Region, portions of the Rocki=
es,
Great Basin and the High Plains. Given the good support in the reforecast
tools, which show at least a 20% chance for sustained winds exceeding the 8=
5th
percentile, a slight risk of high winds is maintained over these regions fr=
om
Sep 17 to 19. Combined with ongoing drought conditions, any increase in
sustained winds may exacerbate multiple ongoing wildfires that continue to
reduce air quality and threaten life and property across the West.



The amplified mid-level trough axis across the West also favors enhanced
onshore flow and resultant increased precipitation chances across much of t=
he
Pacific Northwest. There is good agreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF
reforecast tools depicting at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile. However, there are low
probabilities for totals reaching hazard criteria for the region, thus no
corresponding hazards are issued. The above-normal precipitation favored is
expected to benefit moisture starved soils where D0 to D4 drought condition=
s
are currently registered across the northwestern CONUS. High elevation
snowfall
over parts of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming also cannot be ruled out given the
increase in moisture and colder temperatures favored during week-2.



Downstream, amplified 500-hPa ridging remains favored to develop where ther=
e
is
better agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles with respect to the
anomalous ridge center placement over southeastern Canada. Unseasonably war=
m
temperatures are favored for much of the central and eastern CONUS during
week-2, where the greatest chances of above-normal temperatures exist east =
of
the Mississippi Valley in proximity to the predicted anomalous ridge center=
.
This is well reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool which depicts at least =
a
40% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile over the
Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley and the Northeast. However, both reforecast tools mainta=
in
a
low probability of actual temperatures exceeding hazardous thresholds, and =
in
consideration of decreasing sun angles resulting in a cooler climatology
heading into late September (particularly for the higher latitudes of the
CONUS), no heat related hazards are issued. The highest maximum temperature=
s
during week-2 remain most likely across the Desert Southwest where daytime
highs may reach 105 degrees F, and over 95 degrees over the south-central
CONUS
tied to building heights favored in the models over this part of the countr=
y.
Elevated heat index values remain possible in the south-central CONUS,
including portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley where many populations a=
re
still experiencing power outages and a lack of cooling resources due to
Hurricane Ida.



In the tropics, the latest guidance is beginning to show signs of possible
tropical cyclone formation, where 850-hPa vorticity forecasts from both the=
 0z
deterministic GFS and ECMWF depict a cyclonic circulation that shifts
northward
from the Bahamas, bringing increased amounts of rainfall into portions of t=
he
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic early in the period. Although the GEFS reforecas=
t
tool is less supportive of heavy precipitation potential, the ECMWF reforec=
ast
tool depicts at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall accumulations exceedin=
g
the 85th percentile and one inch early in the period. By the middle of the
period, signals for potential heavy precipitation exist in the reforecast
tools
over the Gulf Coast likely tied to enhanced return flow from the Gulf. Give=
n
high soil moisture percentiles in the wake of Hurricane Ida and the
vulnerability of additional flooding along the Gulf Coast, a broad slight r=
isk
area of heavy precipitation is issued for the southeastern CONUS for Sep 17=
 to
21.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned amplified troughing favors enhanced onshore
flow and resultant increased precipitation chances across much of the Alask=
a
Panhandle. Reforecast tools continue to depict at least a 20% chance of 3-d=
ay
precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches,
supporting the continuation of a slight risk of heavy precipitation from Se=
p
17
to 21. A slight risk of high winds is also maintained for parts of the
Southern
Alaska Mainland and Alaska Panhandle through the middle of the period given
support from the reforecast tools and the surface low development favored i=
n
the ensembles over the Gulf of Alaska. The combined elevated risk of heavy
precipitation and high winds is expected to increase the potential for debr=

flow and landslides in the Panhandle during week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu September 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 15 - 19 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC depict a 500-=
hPa
trough stretching from Alaska to portions of the northwest CONUS, and a rid=
ge
over much of the eastern U.S. Models are in some disagreement on the depth =
and
speed of the trough. The 0z ECMWF ensemble mean forecasts the deepest troug=
h,
with negative height anomalies extending into northwest Minnesota. The 6z G=
EFS
ensemble mean forecasts the trough in a very similar position, though weake=
r
than the 0z ECMWF. The CMC ensemble mean depicts the weakest and fastest
trough
of the three, with negative height anomalies extending into portions of the
Great Lakes. The ECMWF ensemble mean has shown the best run to run continui=
ty
over the past several days, and is favored in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs manual 500-hPa blend.
The
blend features negative height anomalies over Mainland Alaska and over the
northwest and north central Lower 48, positive height anomalies over most o=
f
the eastern third of the CONUS and portions of the Southwest, and near norm=
al
heights over most of the southern half of the U.S.

Predicted 500-hPa ridging forecast over the Southwest and must of the easte=
rn
CONUS leads to increased chances of above normal temperatures. Troughing
forecast to spread south from Mainland Alaska into the northwestern quadran=
t
of
the Lower 48 favors near to below normal temperatures for Alaska and the
northwest CONUS.

The forecast trough moving south from Alaska into parts of the CONUS favors=
 a
more southerly storm track than normal, leading to increased chances of nea=
r
to
below normal precipitation for Alaska and above normal precipitation for th=
e
Pacific Northwest. South of the predicted trough and beneath forecast surfa=
ce
high pressure, the likelihood of near to below normal precipitation is
elevated
across the rest of the western half of the CONUS. Ahead of the predicted
trough, several storm systems are forecast to sweep eastward, favoring abov=
e
normal precipitation for most of the eastern half of the U.S.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good agreement among the models and tools and a relatively amplified
pattern, offset by differences in the position and strength of the western
trough.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 17 - 23 2021

Heading into the week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern is forecast to remain
relatively stationary, though the amplitude of most features is expected to=
 be
lower due to increased uncertainty. Due to the pattern being very similar t=
o
the 6-10 day period, the week-2 temperature and precipitation probability
forecasts are very similar as well. One difference is in Alaska, where heig=
hts
are predicted to increase during the week-2 period, favoring below normal
precipitation for the Aleutians and Mainland. In addition, the potential fo=
r
tropical cyclone activity later during the week-2 period increases the
likelihood of above normal precipitation for the Florida Peninsula.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Yesterday's
operational 18z GFS centered on Day 10, and 60% of Today's 0z European
Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the models and tools, and a relatively amplified and
persistent pattern across the domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Thu Sep 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

Several areas of fire weather potential are expected Friday. The
Elevated area over northwestern Nevada was shifted southward across
the Sierra for gusty winds and dry conditions away from areas
expected to receive heavier precipitation. The dry thunder area was
consolidated across northern/central Nevada to better account for
wetter storm modes less favorable for lightning ignitions. Storm
coverage will likely approach scattered criteria across portions of
eastern Idaho later Friday afternoon with additional convective
coverage as far east as western Wyoming. However, increasing
boundary-layer moisture and less favorable fuels should keep the
risk for lightning ignitions isolated. Finally, the elevated area
across Wyoming and the Dakotas was adjusted for the latest guidance
with no considerable changes. Please see the previous forecast for
additional information.

..Lyons.. 09/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Thu Sep 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Pacific Northwest and central
Rockies as the upper ridge/anticyclone across the interior West
continues to break down tomorrow/Friday. Upper support associated
with the passing mid-level trough will encourage scattered to
widespread thunderstorm development across the western Great Basin
into eastern Oregon and the central Rockies through the entire day
tomorrow. Also, at least locally dry and breezy conditions are
likely across much of the interior West, with more widespread dry
and breezy conditions possible along the lee of the Sierra and
central into eastern Wyoming.

...Interior West - Isolated Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing at
the start of the Day 2 period, mainly across the western Great Basin
into central Oregon. Through the day, the strongest deep-layer
ascent within close proximity to the upper-trough axis will move
eastward towards the central Rockies with a band of scattered to
numerous, predominantly wet storms. While this scenario would not
typically warrant fire weather highlights, an isolated dry
thunderstorm area was introduced since any strikes present on the
periphery of storms would be occurring over fuels that are modestly
to extremely critically receptive to wildfire spread.

...Northwest Nevada...
On the backside of the upper trough, modest mid-level flow will
overspread the Sierra, encouraging downslope flow to the lee of the
higher terrain. Latest guidance consensus suggests 15-25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds may coincide with 20% RH by
afternoon peak heating. Despite the stronger surface winds, some
questions remain if RH can drop to 20% for at least a few hours.
Elevated highlights may need to be removed in future outlooks should
guidance trend cooler and moister to the lee of the Sierra.

...Central Wyoming into the central High Plains...
By mid-afternoon, downslope flow to the lee of the Rockies will
support 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20% RH.
Given modestly receptive fuels, Elevated highlights have been
introduced.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Maine through Friday morning...

...Tropical Depression Mindy moves off the Georgia coast out over
the Atlantic and is forecast to become extratropical slowly...

...Heatwave over the West will slowly weaken as a Critical Risk of
fire weather is over the Northwest...

A front extending from the Northeast Coast to the Gulf of Mexico
will slowly move eastward off most of the East Coast by Friday
morning. Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of
the front over parts of the Northeast. Furthermore, heavy rain is
associated with these thunderstorms that will fall over parts of
Maine. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms through Friday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable. The excessive rainfall threat will end over the
Northeast on Friday morning as the front continues to move
offshore.

Meanwhile, Tropical Depression Mindy moves off the Georgia coast
out over the Atlantic and is forecast to become an extratropical
low by Friday evening.  The front over the Gulf Coast will become
quasi-stationary, aiding in developing numerous showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Gulf Coast through Saturday.

Elsewhere, an upper-level high over the Great Basin will aid in
producing record high temperatures over the Western States will
move over parts of the Central Rockies and the Central/Southern
High Plains on Friday. However, upper-level energy moving over the
Northwest will produce some showers on Friday into Saturday.
Additionally, some of the storms, maybe dry thunderstorms along
with gusty winds, lead to a Critical Risk of fire weather threat
over parts of the Northwest, with a large area of a Critical Risk
of fire weather over parts of the Great Basin into the Northern
Rockies/Northern High Plains. Therefore, Red Flag Warnings are
over parts of the Pacific Northwest/Northern California into the
Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains. Furthermore, Air
Quality Alerts up over parts of the Pacific Northwest, Idaho,
Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire smoke.

...Potential Heavy Rain Threat for Western Gulf Region Late This
Weekend and Early Next Week...

...Overview...

Fast, quasi-zonal flow across the northern tier of the U.S. will
keep the majority of the CONUS in a drier weather pattern. A
tropical disturbance that may emerge into the western Gulf late
this weekend into early next week does pose a potential heavy rain
threat for portions of the Texas and southern Louisiana coasts.
Temperatures will generally be near to below normal across the
northern tier north of the front and near the Gulf, but warmer
than normal in between from the Southwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Faster, quasi zonal flow that is expected to setup across the
CONUS over the course of the medium range period and the latest
model guidance continues to struggle with that evolution.
Particularly noted as an outlier and therefore not included in the
WPC model blend preferences was the 00Z/06Z runs of the GFS where
were initially too fast with the trough progression on day 3/4 and
then become nearly out of phase with other deterministic models
and associated ensemble means with another approaching shortwave
energy late in the period. Once that timing difference starts, it
expands through the period rendering an all-encompassing blend
ineffectual. For now, a non-GFS blend was preferred which
transitions well from continuity and favors more of the ensemble
support.

For the western Gulf, a broad tropical plume associated with a
weak disturbance will gradually lift northwest toward the TX/LA
coasts late Sunday into early/middle of next week. There is
considerable uncertainty in the potential strength, development,
and track of this feature but the latest guidance is in reasonable
agreement for the potential of heavy rainfall along the immediate
coasts that could reach several inches or more over the multi-day
period. Interests in these areas should continue to monitor the
latest forecasts.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana Gulf coasts. Several
inches appear possible and this could lead to some flooding
concerns. Otherwise, frontal boundaries slipping through the flow
across the central and northern U.S. will bring mostly lighter
rainfall amounts to portions of the CONUS with some potential for
isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts. Temperatures will
largely be below normal across the northern tier with swings above
normal ahead of frontal passages across the central/eastern U.S..
Readings on Sunday and Monday could top 10-15F above normal across
the Central Plains to lower Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes.

...Potential Heavy Rain Threat for Western Gulf Region Late This
Weekend and Early Next Week...

...Overview...

Fast, quasi-zonal flow across the northern tier of the U.S. will
keep the majority of the CONUS in a drier weather pattern. A
tropical disturbance that may emerge into the western Gulf late
this weekend into early next week does pose a potential heavy rain
threat for portions of the Texas and southern Louisiana coasts.
Temperatures will generally be near to below normal across the
northern tier north of the front and near the Gulf, but warmer
than normal in between from the Southwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Faster, quasi zonal flow that is expected to setup across the
CONUS over the course of the medium range period and the latest
model guidance continues to struggle with that evolution.
Particularly noted as an outlier and therefore not included in the
WPC model blend preferences was the 00Z/06Z runs of the GFS where
were initially too fast with the trough progression on day 3/4 and
then become nearly out of phase with other deterministic models
and associated ensemble means with another approaching shortwave
energy late in the period. Once that timing difference starts, it
expands through the period rendering an all-encompassing blend
ineffectual. For now, a non-GFS blend was preferred which
transitions well from continuity and favors more of the ensemble
support.

For the western Gulf, a broad tropical plume associated with a
weak disturbance will gradually lift northwest toward the TX/LA
coasts late Sunday into early/middle of next week. There is
considerable uncertainty in the potential strength, development,
and track of this feature but the latest guidance is in reasonable
agreement for the potential of heavy rainfall along the immediate
coasts that could reach several inches or more over the multi-day
period. Interests in these areas should continue to monitor the
latest forecasts.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana Gulf coasts. Several
inches appear possible and this could lead to some flooding
concerns. Otherwise, frontal boundaries slipping through the flow
across the central and northern U.S. will bring mostly lighter
rainfall amounts to portions of the CONUS with some potential for
isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts. Temperatures will
largely be below normal across the northern tier with swings above
normal ahead of frontal passages across the central/eastern U.S..
Readings on Sunday and Monday could top 10-15F above normal across
the Central Plains to lower Ohio Valley and lower Great Lakes.

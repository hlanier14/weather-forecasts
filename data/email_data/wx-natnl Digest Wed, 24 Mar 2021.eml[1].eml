Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1040 AM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN ARIZONA INTO
FAR WEST TEXAS...

No changes have been made to the current fire weather highlights.
Clear skies are evident over the southwest U.S based on the latest
visible satellite imagery, with continued boundary-layer mixing
expected to contribute to Elevated/Critical fire weather conditions
across portions of the region later today. Guidance consensus
continues to show 20 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
overlapping 10-15% RH over portions of far southeast Arizona into
southern New Mexico and Far West Texas later this afternoon.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, dry surface conditions are expected
across portions of the Northern Plains, the Northeast, and the
Florida Peninsula by afternoon peak heating. Fuels across these
areas are at least marginally supportive of some wildfire-spread
potential given the lack of appreciable rainfall over the past two
weeks. However, the lack of stronger surface winds precludes fire
weather highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1213 AM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A longwave trough will amplify southward into Arizona today while
maintaining a belt of strong (40-70kt) mid-level flow across the
southern Rockies and U.S./Mexico border.  This flow will occur atop
a very dry airmass left over in the wake of a prior system that will
eject toward the mid-Mississippi Valley area.  Lee troughing/weak
surface cyclogenesis will also organize across southern New Mexico,
fostering a favorable regime for elevated to critical fire-weather
conditions across the southern Rockies.

...Southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and far west Texas...
Vertical mixing processes and a favorable surface pressure pattern
will allow for an axis of 25-35mph westerly surface winds from
southeastern Arizona to far west Texas - strongest in Arizona.  This
flow will occur within a very dry low-level airmass, with surface
temperatures rising into the 60s/low 70s F resulting in RH values as
long as single digits in west Texas.  Ongoing drought across
portions of the region and dry fuels will support a risk of large
fires and rapid spread.  The critical delineation is focused on
areas that are expected to experience the strongest surface wind
gusts (>20 mph) amid dry conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 23 2021

SYNOPSIS: A mid-level trough is forecast to move eastward across the northern
tier of the contiguous U.S. during early Week-2. An associated cold front will
likely result in precipitation and slightly below normal temperatures
throughout the eastern half of the U.S. during the week, but neither of these
is expected to reach our hazard criteria. Several surface cyclones are
expected
to affect coastal Alaska during the period, but impacts are also forecast to
remain below hazardous levels.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as odds are not anticipated to
reach
pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 26 - TUESDAY MARCH 30:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!u2E3NbKuRtSynT2Wf_H3atMtMdB8dGpfz2iiDDzZxbHD5CEOr5r069w0SAl0OI8YMqLjvTwP$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 31 - TUESDAY APRIL 06: The Week-2 period is forecast to
begin with surface cyclones impacting coastal Alaska and the Northeast. Each
of
these cyclones will likely result in precipitation and winds throughout the
impacted areas, but the probabilities that any of the impacts reaches our
hazards criteria are below 20%. The system over the Northeast should lift away
mid-week, leaving high pressure and quiet weather in its wake.



There are weak indications that temperatures in southwestern Texas could
exceed
the 85th climatological percentile during the middle of Week-2. The
deterministic 00z ECMWF suggests that daily high temperatures could be in the
mid-90s F during this time. However, neither the deterministic GFS nor the
ECMWF ensembles forecast temperatures are this warm, so no associated hazards
have been posted.



Persistent cyclone activity along Alaska's South Coast is expected to result
in
wind and precipitation that remains below our hazardous thresholds. In the
longer term, this relatively cool and wet pattern could increase snow water
across the mainland leading to increased flooding concerns during eventual
river ice break up later in April.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

The Elevated area was expanded southward, as 15-20% RH values are
expected to overlap 15 mph sustained southwesterly winds during the
afternoon across portions of the Texas Big Bend towards the Stockton
and Edwards Plateaus. However, models have trended more moist across
portions of the Trans Pecos. Nonetheless, given receptive fuels and
expected 20% RH, Elevated highlights remain. The Elevated area may
be trimmed southward in future outlooks if moistening trends
continue in future guidance. Otherwise, dry surface conditions are
expected to persist across the Florida Peninsula, but with light and
variable winds, precluding fire weather highlights.

..Squitieri.. 03/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1214 AM CDT Tue Mar 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will be a bit more spatially limited/focused
on D2/Wed compared to prior days.  A surface ridge will build
southward across the southern High Plains that should generally
suppress the extent of breezy/dry conditions southward toward the
TransPecos and areas of west Texas.  Meanwhile, strong flow aloft
will continue as a mid/upper wave amplifies southeastward through
northwestern Mexico.  A weak surface trough will also reside across
central Texas, helping to separate moistening surface conditions
across east Texas from much drier air over the southern Rockies.

...West Texas/southeastern New Mexico...
Along and south of the surface ridge/front, westerly flow will
continue to exceed 20 mph especially in terrain-favored areas in the
general vicinity of the TransPecos.  RH values are a bit in
question, however, as the region will likely experience areas of
cloudiness resulting from the upstream mid-level wave.  Still, RH
values should flirt with critical thresholds amidst windy surface
conditions.  Multiple days of very dry weather should also cure
fuels and support fire-spread potential.  An elevated delineation
has been added to address this threat, though expansions or even
upgrades are possible if it appears that RH values will fall below
currently expected ranges.

...Heavy rain possible across parts of the interior Deep
South/Tennessee Valley on Saturday...

...Overview...

An unsettled and active weather pattern is forecast for the
eastern two-thirds of the country through this weekend into early
next week, as shortwaves/troughs from both the northern and
southern streams tend to interact/merge across the region.  A
compact and possibly intense low pressure system is forecast to
track through the Great Lakes and New England Friday to Saturday
before another developing system tracking across the same regions
Sunday into Monday with cyclogenesis possible near the New England
coast.  A swath of moderate to heavy rain remains to be favored
across parts of the Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday
under this pattern.  Meanwhile, much of the West should trend
warmer/drier as upper ridging builds into the weekend before the
next system enters the Pacific Northwest and brings another round
of rain and mountain snows to the region.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Among the model guidance, the ECMWF has been showing the best
level of consistency for the past few runs although it has been
generally the slowest piece of the guidance through the
medium-range period.  The GFS has been on the fast side while the
CMC has been somewhere in between through Day 5 and then closer to
the fast solution through Day 7 for the Pacific Northwest system.
Thus, half of WPC morning medium-range forecast was based on 00Z
ECMWF/EC mean.  The 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and the 00Z CMC/CMC mean
made up the second half.  More of the ensemble means were
incorporated for Days 5-7 to account for the increasing
uncertainty.  Very good WPC continuity was maintained with a
slightly faster eastward progression of each system than the
previous forecast.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

There is increasing model signals for a compact and possibly quite
intense low pressure system to track through the Great Lakes and
New England Friday to Saturday, bringing the potential for strong
and very gusty winds to impact the Northeast.  Some heavy wet snow
could fall across northern Maine Saturday morning as the low
pressure center likely passes to the south.  The trailing frontal
boundary in the Gulf of Mexico should lift northward as a warm
front focusing another round of moderate to heavy rainfall across
parts of the Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday.  The
next system sends another cold front into the East with widespread
light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the Eastern
states on Sunday.  This system could undergo cyclogenesis on
Monday as it nears the New England coast. The trend should be
towards warmer and drier weather out West this weekend, ahead of
the next system into the Pacific Northwest which should bring
another round of rain and mountain snow to the region early next
week.

The eastern third of the country will start warm and above normal
through the weekend, with the greatest anomalies (+15 to +20F)
across the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Friday. Morning lows will
be even more so anomalously warm, with several record high minimum
temperatures possible late this week stretching from Florida to
the Northeast. Troughing entering the region early next week
should bring temperatures back down towards normal next Monday and
Tuesday. Out West, temperatures should trend warmer after this
week as upper level ridging builds across the region.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue March 23 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 29 - APR 02, 2021

A transient mid-level pattern is forecast across North America during the 6-10
day period, with shortwave troughing predicted to move through the central and
eastern CONUS. Behind this feature, broad ridging is favored to develop over
the CONUS, but there are timing differences in the models in regards to this
evolution. The GEFS based guidance is about a day faster than the ECMWF
guidance, which adds some uncertainty to the overall forecast for the period.
Todays manual blend depicts negative 500-hPa height anomalies across the
Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast, and
positive height anomalies elsewhere across the CONUS. Anomalous ridging is
forecast across much of the central and eastern Pacific, with a series of
shortwave troughs predicted to track to the north of this feature across
Alaska. This intermittent troughing favors near to below normal heights for
most of the Mainland. Above normal heights are forecast over the Panhandle,
and
the Aleutians.

Prior to the start of the period, shortwave troughing is forecast to be moving
off the East Coast, resulting in relatively cooler temperatures over the East
on day-6. However, due to the transient nature of the pattern, this cool down
is predicted to be brief with above normal temperatures returning by the
middle
of the period. Temperatures may cool again toward the end of the period as the
next trough moves through. For the period overall, near normal temperatures
are
favored across New England, with a slight tilt toward above normal temperature
probabilities across parts of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Northeast, and
mid-Atlantic. Cooler conditions behind the aforementioned trough also favor
near normal temperatures for the period as a whole across parts of the
Northwest, and extending through the Central Rockies, Central Plains, Middle
Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee Valley, although a warming trend is likely
in
these regions by day-10. Probabilities for above normal temperatures are
higher
across Florida, the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and California,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal temperature
probabilities are increased across Alaska, given the potential for shortwave
troughing to lower heights across the state, as well as decreased solar
heating
across the southern part of Alaska and the Panhandle. These elevated below
normal temperature probabilities also extend into parts of the Pacific
Northwest.

Troughing forecast to move through the central and eastern CONUS favors an
active frontal zone across the Southern Plains, Mississippi Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast where there is a slight tilt
toward above normal precipitation probabilities. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored across the rest of the CONUS due to limited synoptic
forcing. The highest probabilities of below normal precipitation are
highlighted over the West, underneath the greatest influence from ridging.
Troughing over Alaska and increased westerlies result in above normal
precipitation chances across much of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
model agreement in terms of a transient pattern, offset by uncertainty in
terms
of exact timing, and the temperature forecast across the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 31 - APR 06, 2021

Forecast confidence is greater in week-2 compared to days 6-10 as dynamical
models agree on broad ridging taking shape across the CONUS by the middle of
the period, leading to a warm first week of April for many areas. Troughing
discussed in the 6-10 day outlook is forecast to be moving through the eastern
CONUS early in the period, but a trend toward higher mid-level heights is
favored as the period progresses. The manual blend for the week-2 period shows
above normal 500-hPa heights for the entire CONUS, with a 90-meter positive
height anomaly center over the Middle Mississippi Valley. Negative height
anomalies are forecast over much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle
underneath troughing. Positive height anomalies remain forecast for the
Aleutians.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS. The
overall transition to broad synoptic ridging favors a tilt toward above normal
temperatures, which is supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool. The GEFS
reforecast tool depicts higher probabilities of below normal temperatures
across the central and eastern CONUS, but given the positive height anomalies
depicted in the GEFS for the period as a whole, increased probabilities of
above normal temperatures is the favored solution. A forecast trend toward a
neutral or slightly negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation may
promote increased backdoor cold front activity into the Northeast, which may
reduce the chances of having a sustained period of warmth. While probabilities
for above normal temperatures remain elevated over the Northeast, they are not
as high as depicted in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Increased troughing across
Alaska and associated north to northwesterly mid-level flow favor increased
probabilities of below normal temperatures across the state. Some of these
colder temperatures may also expand into portions of the Pacific Northwest,
where a slight tilt toward increased near to below normal temperature
probabilities are forecast.

Below normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced across most of the
CONUS,
given the lack of any defined mid-level features and the aforementioned broad
ridging forecast to expand across the CONUS. This is supported by both the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools. The exception is over parts of Texas where moist,
southeasterly surface flow out of the Gulf of Mexico favors enhanced
precipitation chances over a climatologically arid area for this time of year.
As a result, probabilities of above normal precipitation are increased across
the state. Troughing over Alaska and a series of surface lows forecast to
track
in the vicinity of the state result in above normal precipitation chances

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement in terms of the evolving mid-level pattern across North
America, offset by the temperature forecast across the central and eastern
CONUS.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

...Heavy rain and possible severe thunderstorms to drench the
central Gulf Coast and Tennessee Valley over the next couple of
days...

...Heavy mountain snow expected for the Southern Rockies...

...Critical Risk of fire weather remains in place from portions of
southeastern Arizona to West Texas today...

A potent low pressure system in the Central Plains this afternoon
is gradually tracking northeast while sporting an impressive areal
extent of precipitation that stretches from the northern Great
Lakes to the Gulf Coast. The central Gulf Coast most notably
features the best odds of witnessing heavy rainfall and severe
weather through tonight. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall has
been issued for portions of the area today, along with a Slight
Risk of severe weather. Severe storms and locally heavy rainfall
are also possible in the middle Mississippi Valley. As the
occluded low enters the Great Lakes by Wednesday, its associated
shield of rain will overspread the region throughout the day.
Light snow will be possible across northern Minnesota. Meanwhile,
a cold front associated with this storm system is forecast to
stall and lift north as a warm front over the South-Central U.S.
Wednesday afternoon. This sets the stage for another round of
severe weather Wednesday evening, highlighted by a Slight Risk for
severe thunderstorms in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Meanwhile,
another frontal boundary near the central Gulf Coast looks to
produce more heavy rainfall embedded within strong thunderstorms.
Yet another Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall is in place for
roughly the same area on Wednesday that is currently experiencing
heavy rain this afternoon. The heavy rain and severe weather
threat does not end Wednesday and extends into Thursday, as an
even more robust low pressure system enters the Lower Mississippi
Valley. This next round of active weather is expected to include a
possible outbreak of severe thunderstorms across the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast, as well as downpours and
potential flash flooding as far north as the Tennessee Valley. In
total through Thursday night, over 5 inches of rainfall is
possible from eastern Louisiana to southern Alabama, with 2 to 4
inches of rain expected from northern Mississippi to western
Tennessee. Flash Flood Watches remain in effect for portions of
the central Gulf Coast through Thursday night.

Farther West, a cold front is moving quickly southward across the
Southwest this afternoon with a broad area of rain and snow
showers behind. A fresh injection of below normal temperatures and
gusty winds follow the front as well. The front will slow over the
Southwest tonight ahead of an amplifying upper trough over the
Four Corners region. This upper trough then triggers periods of
mountain snow over the southern Rockies with totals ranging from 1
to 2 feet in the highest elevations of northern New Mexico.
Another front is forecast to enter the Northwest U.S. with
additional precipitation on Wednesday and Thursday. The upper
trough is forecast to quickly weaken Wednesday evening, closing
the door on additional snowfall in the southern Rockies, but it
does help to produce scattered showers in parts of the Southern
Plains. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories are in
affect across much of New Mexico in a anticipation for the
upcoming snowfall.

Elsewhere, conditions remain favorable for fire weather over parts
of the Southwest and southern High Plains this evening due to low
relative humidities combined with gusty winds and dry fuels. Red
Flag Warnings are in place, along with Elevated to Critical Risks
of fire weather. Some welcomed precipitation is anticipated in
these areas through Thursday. The Northwest will see yet another
round of precipitation as a cold front swings through the region
Wednesday evening, where several inches of mountain snow is
possible throughout the region. Lastly, high pressure supplying
one more day of welcome warmth and dry conditions throughout the
Northeast gives way to an approaching frontal system off the East
Coast on Wednesday. This storm system is set to deliver periods of
rain to the Northeast. However, the above average temperatures in
the East will rebound Thursday and could break several daily
records. This includes both record warm highs and lows throughout
the Northeast and Florida.

...Heavy rain possible across parts of the interior Deep
South/Tennessee Valley on Saturday...

...Overview...

An unsettled and active weather pattern is forecast for the
eastern two-thirds of the country through this weekend into early
next week, as shortwaves/troughs from both the northern and
southern streams tend to interact/merge across the region.  A
compact and possibly intense low pressure system is forecast to
track through the Great Lakes and New England Friday to Saturday
before another developing system tracking across the same regions
Sunday into Monday with cyclogenesis possible near the New England
coast.  A swath of moderate to heavy rain is forecast for parts of
the Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday under this
pattern.  Meanwhile, much of the West should trend warmer/drier as
upper ridging builds into the weekend before the next system
enters the Pacific Northwest and brings another round of rain and
mountain snows to the region.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Among all of the model guidance, the ECMWF has been showing the
best level of consistency for the past few runs although it has
been generally the slowest piece of the guidance through the
medium-range period.  The GFS has been on the fast side while the
CMC has been somewhere in between through Day 5 and then closer to
the fast solution through Day 7 for the Pacific Northwest system.
The preference for this morning's WPC medium-range forecast was to
use 50% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean.  The 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS, and the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean made up the second half.  More of the ensemble means
were incorporated for Days 5-7 to account for the increasing
uncertainty.  Very good WPC continuity was maintained with a
slightly faster eastward progression of each system than the
previous forecast.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

There is increasing model signals for a compact and possibly quite
intense low pressure system to track through the Great Lakes and
New England Friday to Saturday, bringing the potential for strong
and very gusty winds to the Northeast.  Some heavy wet snow could
fall across northern Maine Saturday morning as the low pressure
center likely passes to the south.  The trailing frontal boundary
in the Gulf of Mexico should lift northward as a warm front
focusing another round of moderate to heavy rainfall across parts
of the Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday.  The next
system sends another cold front into the East on Sunday with
widespread light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the
Eastern states.  This system could undergo cyclogenesis on Monday
as the center nears the New England coast, and could bring another
round of wintry precipitation for northern New England.  Out West,
the trend should be towards warmer and drier weather this weekend,
ahead of the next system into the Pacific Northwest which should
bring another round of rain and mountain snow to the region early
next week with a return to cooler than normal temperatures.

The eastern third of the country will start out very warm Friday
afternoon with the greatest anomalies (+15 to +20F) across the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, and will remain warmer than normal
through the weekend.  Morning lows will be even more so
anomalously warm, with several record high minimum temperatures
possible late this week stretching from Florida to the Northeast.
Troughing entering the region early next week should bring
temperatures back down towards normal next Monday and Tuesday.

...Heavy rain possible across parts of the interior Deep
South/Tennessee Valley on Saturday...

...Overview...

A strong surface low will be exiting the Northeast as the period
begins on Saturday, while a vigorous northern stream shortwave
sends another deepening surface low from the Central Plains to the
Great Lakes/Northeast Saturday-Monday. This should keep weather in
the East active this weekend into early next week with the best
chance for heavy rain across parts of the Deep South on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the guidance shows southern stream energy breaking off
from the main trough axis with a cutoff upper low lingering over
the Southwest this weekend, before eventually getting pushed east
and absorbed as the next system enters the West. This should bring
another round of rain and mountain snows from the Pacific
Northwest to the Rockies early next week.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles are pretty agreeable through the
period on the overall synoptic pattern, but offer continued
uncertainty in the details. There continues to be some question
with the Southwest cutoff low, and whether such a feature exists
at all. Just 24-hours ago, this appeared to be an outlier solution
in the GFS and now most of the guidance (including a fair number
of ensemble members) have picked up on this feature (except,
ironically, the GFS flip flopping run to run). This doesn't look
to be much of a weather maker anyways, aside from some showery
activity in the Four Corners region, but how the energy interacts
with the next shortwave moving through the Northwest next Monday
could be important. Elsewhere, models show good agreement with the
shortwaves in the Northeast and the Northwest, albeit some timing
differences. With both, the GFS is fast compared to the better
consensus so after day 5 it was excluded from the blend. Among all
the guidance, the ECMWF has been showing the best level of
consistency for the past few runs so a fair amount of it was used
through the whole period. The first half of the period used a
majority blend of deterministic solutions (ECMWF/CMC/GFS) with
more ensemble mean incorporated after day 5 to account for
increasing uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

An intense low pressure system should be off the coast as the
medium range period begins, but lingering gusty winds may continue
Saturday across the Northeast. The trailing frontal boundary in
the Gulf of Mexico should lift northward as a warm front focusing
another round of moderate to heavy rainfall across parts of the
Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday. The next system
sends another cold front into the Northeast on Sunday with
widespread light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the
Eastern states. The Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the
severe weather potential with this system, mainly across the
Southeast so refer to products from SPC for more information. This
system could undergo cyclogenesis Sunday into Monday as the center
nears the New England coast, and could result in some wintry
precipitation for northern New England. Out West, the trend should
be towards warmer and drier weather this weekend, ahead of the
next system into the Pacific Northwest which likely brings another
round of rain and mountain snow to the region early next week.
Showers and storms should also break out into the Central Plains
and Midwest next Monday and Tuesday ahead of the Western U.S.
trough.

The Eastern half of the nation starts warm this weekend, but
trends back towards normal Sunday/Monday after the cold front
moves through. Above normal temperatures will also progress from
the West to Central states this weekend underneath of upper level
ridging. The greatest anomalies will be across the Northern Plains
where daytime highs could be 15 to 20 degrees above normal Sunday
and Monday. The West Coast drops back towards normal or slightly
below normal Monday/Tuesday as troughing enters the region, while
above normal temperatures may again move into the East by next
Wednesday.

...Heavy rain possible across parts of the interior Deep
South/Tennessee Valley on Saturday...

...Overview...

A strong surface low will be exiting the Northeast as the period
begins on Saturday, while a vigorous northern stream shortwave
sends another deepening surface low from the Central Plains to the
Great Lakes/Northeast Saturday-Monday. This should keep weather in
the East active this weekend into early next week with the best
chance for heavy rain across parts of the Deep South on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the guidance shows southern stream energy breaking off
from the main trough axis with a cutoff upper low lingering over
the Southwest this weekend, before eventually getting pushed east
and absorbed as the next system enters the West. This should bring
another round of rain and mountain snows from the Pacific
Northwest to the Rockies early next week.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles are pretty agreeable through the
period on the overall synoptic pattern, but offer continued
uncertainty in the details. There continues to be some question
with the Southwest cutoff low, and whether such a feature exists
at all. Just 24-hours ago, this appeared to be an outlier solution
in the GFS and now most of the guidance (including a fair number
of ensemble members) have picked up on this feature (except,
ironically, the GFS flip flopping run to run). This doesn't look
to be much of a weather maker anyways, aside from some showery
activity in the Four Corners region, but how the energy interacts
with the next shortwave moving through the Northwest next Monday
could be important. Elsewhere, models show good agreement with the
shortwaves in the Northeast and the Northwest, albeit some timing
differences. With both, the GFS is fast compared to the better
consensus so after day 5 it was excluded from the blend. Among all
the guidance, the ECMWF has been showing the best level of
consistency for the past few runs so a fair amount of it was used
through the whole period. The first half of the period used a
majority blend of deterministic solutions (ECMWF/CMC/GFS) with
more ensemble mean incorporated after day 5 to account for
increasing uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

An intense low pressure system should be off the coast as the
medium range period begins, but lingering gusty winds may continue
Saturday across the Northeast. The trailing frontal boundary in
the Gulf of Mexico should lift northward as a warm front focusing
another round of moderate to heavy rainfall across parts of the
Deep South to the Tennessee Valley on Saturday. The next system
sends another cold front into the Northeast on Sunday with
widespread light to moderate precipitation likely to impact the
Eastern states. The Storm Prediction Center is monitoring the
severe weather potential with this system, mainly across the
Southeast so refer to products from SPC for more information. This
system could undergo cyclogenesis Sunday into Monday as the center
nears the New England coast, and could result in some wintry
precipitation for northern New England. Out West, the trend should
be towards warmer and drier weather this weekend, ahead of the
next system into the Pacific Northwest which likely brings another
round of rain and mountain snow to the region early next week.
Showers and storms should also break out into the Central Plains
and Midwest next Monday and Tuesday ahead of the Western U.S.
trough.

The Eastern half of the nation starts warm this weekend, but
trends back towards normal Sunday/Monday after the cold front
moves through. Above normal temperatures will also progress from
the West to Central states this weekend underneath of upper level
ridging. The greatest anomalies will be across the Northern Plains
where daytime highs could be 15 to 20 degrees above normal Sunday
and Monday. The West Coast drops back towards normal or slightly
below normal Monday/Tuesday as troughing enters the region, while
above normal temperatures may again move into the East by next
Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0142 AM CDT Wed Mar 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will be focused to a relatively confined area
of west Texas and southeastern New Mexico today.  Enhanced mid-level
flow will continue to reside across the region today although
surface cooling and increased RH values will occur as a result of
clouds and proximity to lift from a positive-tilt shortwave just
upstream over New Mexico.  Elsewhere, locally elevated fire-weather
conditions may develop along the Lower Colorado River Valley as dry
northerly surface flow increases to around 15-20 mph.  Fire-weather
concerns should be limited elsewhere.

...Portions of west Texas and far southeastern New Mexico...
A relatively confined area of dry and breezy conditions will develop
along and east of the TransPecos this afternoon and early evening.
Wind speeds will exceed 20 mph in these areas for several hours as
RH values flirt with critical thresholds at times.  RH values are a
bit in question with northward and westward extent, however, as a
cold airmass migrates southward out of central New Mexico during the
period.  This will create shifting winds (to northwesterly) at times
during the afternoon that may complicate any fire-suppression
efforts.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Wed Mar 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
A negative-tilt mid-level wave over the southern Plains will eject
northeastward toward the southern Great Lakes region during the
D2/Thu forecast period.  As this occurs, an upstream wave will
amplify across Nevada and Utah that will maintain a belt of strong
flow aloft across dry areas of the southern Rockies.  At the
surface, a low will deepen quickly over Arkansas as high pressure
temporarily settles into Texas.  Upstream, another lee trough will
organize across eastern New Mexico and vicinity that will increase
surface flow across portions of Arizona and New Mexico.
Fire-weather concerns will exist across deep south Texas, while a
more conditional risk will develop across southern Arizona/New
Mexico and far west Texas.

...Deep south Texas...
Northwesterly low-level flow will exist across the region for much
of the morning through early afternoon.  This flow will occur within
a dry airmass characterized by RH values in the 10-15% range in
conjunction with surface temperatures rising well into the 80s F.
Wind speeds may be a limiting factor for a prolonged fire-weather
threat, however, as most guidance indicates that wind speeds will
taper during peak heating hours due to a weakening surface pressure
gradient.  Critical fire weather may exist for 1-2 hours before the
winds weaken.  Nevertheless, the dry surface conditions and lack of
rainfall will combine with aforementioned atmospheric conditions to
foster at least elevated fire weather.

...Southeastern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and far west Texas...
Another axis of dry and windy conditions will materialize across
this region during the afternoon and early evening hours.  RH values
should flirt with critical thresholds across several areas during
the afternoon as surface winds increase to 15-25 mph at times.  Any
fire-weather threat will also be conditional upon the extent of
antecedent rainfall (or even snowfall) during the D1/Wed forecast
period.  Where dry fuels exist (most likely in lower elevation
areas), an elevated fire-weather threat is likely.

...Wet and stormy conditions to continue in the South today;
confidence increasing in a severe weather outbreak across the
Mid-South on Thursday, along with the persistent threat of flash
flooding...

...Heavy mountain snow expected for the Southern Rockies this
morning; Elevated Fire Weather Risks to stick around in parts of
the Southwest...

...Unsettled weather and cool temperatures throughout much of the
West; near record warmth likely in the Northeast and Florida on
Thursday...

A storm system tracking through the Midwest is responsible for
producing areas of showers and thunderstorms in the Midwest this
morning with some wintry weather also occurring in the northern
Great Lakes and Northern Plains. This feature will lift northeast
over the northern Great Lakes this afternoon and into southeastern
Canada tonight leaving some light snow accumulations in its wake
over northern Minnesota. Further south, a narrow band of heavy
rain and embedded thunderstorms that soaked portions of the
central Gulf Coast over the last 24 hours will lose some of its
punch this morning, but should redevelop later this afternoon as a
boundary over the Gulf of Mexico lifts north towards the Gulf
Coast. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall remains is in place
over eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi today. Meanwhile,
a potent upper level disturbance currently producing periods of
heavy snow in the Southern Rockies will eject east into the
southern High Plains this evening. An additional 6 to as much as
12 inches of snow is possible in the higher elevations of New
Mexico and southern Colorado. As the winter weather threat
concludes late in the day, scattered showers and thunderstorms
look to develop this afternoon with some storms becoming severe in
some cases. A Slight Risk for severe storms has been issued from
the Storm Prediction Center for parts of the Ark-La-Tex region and
southern Oklahoma, with heavy rainfall rates within these storms
also possible in eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley
Wednesday night.

As the upper trough ejects east on Thursday towards the
Mississippi Valley, attention turns to the Mid-South where
confidence is increasing in a severe weather outbreak transpiring
the second half of the day. Intense thunderstorms are forecast to
breakout across the Deep South and track towards the Tennessee
Valley Thursday afternoon and into the evening hours. All modes of
severe weather: tornadoes, damaging winds, and large hail are
likely to be on display Thursday afternoon. The Storm Prediction
Center has posted a Moderate Risk for severe weather over southern
Tennessee, northern Mississippi, and northern Alabama, while an
expansive Slight Risk area is in place from the central Gulf Coast
on north into the Ohio Valley. In addition to the severe hazards,
hydrologic hazards are also a concern as widespread heavy showers
and thunderstorms may trigger areas of flash flooding. As a
result, a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is in place from
northern Mississippi and Alabama on north into the Tennessee
Valley. A myriad of weather hazards; both severe and rainfall, are
a recipe for a dangerous weather setup in the Mid-South on
Thursday. The severe threat may linger into Thursday night across
the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys while the Northeast contends with
periods of rain overnight Thursday.

Elsewhere, another frontal system ushers in more rounds of rain
and mountain snow to the Northwest today. Snowfall accumulations
over a foot are anticipated along the Cascades and the highest
elevations of the northern Rockies. The front steadily pushes
south on Thursday as an upper level trough plunges south into the
Great Basin and Intermountain West. Expect more mountain snow to
take shape in these regions on Thursday with light rainfall
amounts in the lower elevations. Temperature-wise, the
Intermountain West and Southwest will remain mired and below
normal temperatures due to the active storm track and intrusions
of colder air aloft. It is a very different story though along the
East Coast, for once a nearby coastal low and its assortment of
showers exits Wednesday night, a balmy air-mass rolls in courtesy
of warm southerly flow. Daily record warm max and min temperatures
may be broken in the Northeast on Thursday with the list of
potentially record breaking warmth growing across the region on
Friday. Even the Sunshine State may see a handful of record warm
highs on Thursday as temperatures soar to above 90 degrees in some
locations.

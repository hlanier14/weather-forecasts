Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Fri Oct 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Recent satellite imagery shows a mid-level shortwave trough off the
California coast. This trough is forecast to move across California
early today and into the Great Basin through tonight. As this
occurs, a corridor of enhanced mid-level flow near the base of the
trough is forecast to begin impinging on portions of the
central/southern Plains during the afternoon. Meanwhile, lee surface
troughing is forecast to strengthen through today across portions of
the central Plains.

...Central/Southern High Plains and Southern Plains...
Dry southwesterly downslope flow is expected to increase from midday
into this afternoon in response to the aforementioned strengthening
of a lee surface trough and enhanced mid-level flow overspreading
the area. By afternoon, sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph are
expected across northern/central New Mexico into far southern
Colorado and also across west/southwest Oklahoma and western North
Texas. While meteorologically elevated fire weather conditions are
expected amidst minimum RH values of 15-25%, these conditions are
forecast to remain mostly over areas where fuels are only modestly
receptive to large fire spread (e.g., ERC percentiles generally
below the 80th percentile). Locally elevated fire weather conditions
are most likely across western Oklahoma/North Texas (fuels are a bit
more receptive) and across south-central/southeastern Colorado
(fuels are critically receptive but forecast winds are lighter).

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Fri Oct 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough is expected to deepen as it moves from the Great
Basin into the Four Corners region Day 2/Saturday. Meanwhile,
enhanced mid-level flow near the base of trough is forecast to
persist across portions of the central/southern Plains. At the
surface, a lee cyclone is forecast to deepen over portions of Kansas
and vicinity during the afternoon, which will strengthen the surface
pressure gradient over the central/southern Plains.

...Southern/Central Plains...
Breezy/gusty southwest surface winds are forecast to develop by
midday and strengthen into the afternoon in association with the
aforementioned deepening lee cyclone and enhanced flow aloft. While
sustained surface wind speeds in excess of 20 mph coupled with
minimum RH values of 15-20% should yield several hours of
meteorologically critical conditions, fuels across much of the
southern Plains are forecast by WFAS to remain only modestly
receptive to large fire spread. Fuels are more receptive across the
central Plains but the uncertainty in widespread critical fire
weather conditions is lower. Nevertheless, at least locally critical
conditions are expected over much of the area from midday into the
evening (especially in areas with an abundance of fine/grassy
fuels).

...Northern Rockies...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are possible
across portions of northern Montana Day 2/Saturday afternoon as
westerly sustained surface winds near 15-20 mph overlap minimum RH
values of 20-30%. At this time, uncertainty regarding fuel status
due to potential preceding rainfall, and also poor confidence in a
favorable wind/RH overlap, preclude an elevated fire weather area.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...


...Overview...

Guidance agrees upon a persistent mean ridge aloft from the Gulf
of Mexico into the eastern U.S., while amplifying western U.S.
energy should close off an upper low over or near the southern
Great Basin by early Tuesday and then eject northeastward into the
northern Plains.  The upper low will support next week's dominant
storm system that will evolve over the central Rockies/High Plains
before tracking into southern Canada, bringing significant
mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well as areas of heavy
rainfall to portions of the northern Plains.  The trailing cold
front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy and strong to
severe convection over the southern Plains.  A leading wave
tracking northeastward through the Midwest may produce a band of
enhanced rainfall early in the week.  The amplified upper pattern
will bring a pronounced temperature contrast with well below
normal readings over the West and multiple warm days over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance has been consistent with the general evolution of
the upper low that closes off over the West and then tracks into
the northern Plains, but with some meaningful differences in track
and timing.  The past 24-36 hours of GFS runs have adjusted
somewhat eastward versus prior runs and remaining guidance once
the system reaches the central U.S. though the 18Z run came back a
bit relative to the 12Z run with the new 00Z run holding onto a
similar solution as the 18Z run.  The 12Z CMC/CMC mean were on the
other extreme with a farther northwest track, leaving the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean as closest to an intermediate solution (aside
from the 12Z ECMWF being a bit south of the preferred path) and
WPC continuity.  Among other new 00Z runs, the CMC is getting
closer to other solutions but remains on the northwest side of the
spread by Wednesday-Thursday while the UKMET has trended somewhat
faster the make the GFS less of a minority.  The 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted northward over the Plains to be closer to initial
preference.

As for other aspects of the forecast, CMC runs have been on the
amplified side of guidance with trailing trough energy that
reaches the West--which may be playing a role in its forecast with
the aforementioned system of interest.  A combination of other
guidance looks reasonable for this energy.  Ahead of the main
system, guidance has been showing some difficulty in resolving the
precise surface evolution over the Northeast as an ejecting
Midwest shortwave/possible upper low weakens over the Great
Lakes/Northeast as it flows into/around the mean ridge.  Low
pressure that may initially be near the North Carolina coast (with
only low probability of any tropical or subtropical development
per the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlook) will
likely drift away from the coast with time.

The updated forecast employed a multi-model blend early followed
by a trend to a model/mean mix consisting of slightly more 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean relative to the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean late.  This
provided the intermediate solution desired for the Rockies/Plains
storm and maintained reasonable continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The amplifying western trough and closed upper low development
over the Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring
much below normal temperatures behind a leading cold front/low
pressure, with broad coverage of daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal across much of the interior West next Monday-Wednesday.
This colder air will lowering snow levels in the mountains with
potential for potentially heavy snow accumulations in the higher
terrain of the northern-central Rockies as low pressure
consolidates Tuesday-Wednesday and then track northeastward.  This
would be the first significant winter storm of the season for this
area.  Away from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is
possible around and to the north of the surface low with some
mixing of snow not out of the question during the colder overnight
hours.  Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and
northern Plains by Wednesday and Thursday as the surface low
deepens.  Across the central and southern Plains, moderate to
locally heavy rainfall is possible and the Storm Prediction Center
is monitoring another threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or
Wednesday depending on exact timing of the front that will extend
from the northern Plains low.

Elsewhere, a leading system may bring a band of enhanced rainfall
to parts of the Midwest as it lifts northeastward.  The Pacific
Northwest should see mostly light precipitation with upstream
energy coming in from the Pacific through midweek.  An approaching
late week frontal system may increase amounts somewhat over the
Olympics and far northern Cascades.

The West will see its cold temperatures moderate by
Thursday-Friday with gradually shrinking coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies for highs and morning lows.  Within the eastern U.S.
warmth, highest anomalies for max temperatures will be over the
Great Lakes/Northeast with highs tending to be 10-15F or so above
average.  An overwhelming majority of the East will see plus
10-20F anomalies for lows with some locations over/southwest of
the Great Lakes possibly even warmer Monday-Tuesday.  Such
readings may achieve daily records for warm lows over some areas.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible across portions of
the southern/central Plains Tuesday into Wednesday...


...Overview...

Guidance agrees upon a persistent mean ridge aloft from the Gulf
of Mexico into the eastern U.S., while amplifying western U.S.
energy should close off an upper low over or near the southern
Great Basin by early Tuesday and then eject northeastward into the
northern Plains.  The upper low will support next week's dominant
storm system that will evolve over the central Rockies/High Plains
before tracking into southern Canada, bringing significant
mountain snow to parts of the Rockies as well as areas of heavy
rainfall to portions of the northern Plains.  The trailing cold
front may also serve as a focus for locally heavy and strong to
severe convection over the southern Plains.  A leading wave
tracking northeastward through the Midwest may produce a band of
enhanced rainfall early in the week.  The amplified upper pattern
will bring a pronounced temperature contrast with well below
normal readings over the West and multiple warm days over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent guidance has been consistent with the general evolution of
the upper low that closes off over the West and then tracks into
the northern Plains, but with some meaningful differences in track
and timing.  The past 24-36 hours of GFS runs have adjusted
somewhat eastward versus prior runs and remaining guidance once
the system reaches the central U.S. though the 18Z run came back a
bit relative to the 12Z run with the new 00Z run holding onto a
similar solution as the 18Z run.  The 12Z CMC/CMC mean were on the
other extreme with a farther northwest track, leaving the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean as closest to an intermediate solution (aside
from the 12Z ECMWF being a bit south of the preferred path) and
WPC continuity.  Among other new 00Z runs, the CMC is getting
closer to other solutions but remains on the northwest side of the
spread by Wednesday-Thursday while the UKMET has trended somewhat
faster the make the GFS less of a minority.  The 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted northward over the Plains to be closer to initial
preference.

As for other aspects of the forecast, CMC runs have been on the
amplified side of guidance with trailing trough energy that
reaches the West--which may be playing a role in its forecast with
the aforementioned system of interest.  A combination of other
guidance looks reasonable for this energy.  Ahead of the main
system, guidance has been showing some difficulty in resolving the
precise surface evolution over the Northeast as an ejecting
Midwest shortwave/possible upper low weakens over the Great
Lakes/Northeast as it flows into/around the mean ridge.  Low
pressure that may initially be near the North Carolina coast (with
only low probability of any tropical or subtropical development
per the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlook) will
likely drift away from the coast with time.

The updated forecast employed a multi-model blend early followed
by a trend to a model/mean mix consisting of slightly more 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean relative to the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean late.  This
provided the intermediate solution desired for the Rockies/Plains
storm and maintained reasonable continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The amplifying western trough and closed upper low development
over the Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring
much below normal temperatures behind a leading cold front/low
pressure, with broad coverage of daytime highs 20-30 degrees below
normal across much of the interior West next Monday-Wednesday.
This colder air will lowering snow levels in the mountains with
potential for potentially heavy snow accumulations in the higher
terrain of the northern-central Rockies as low pressure
consolidates Tuesday-Wednesday and then track northeastward.  This
would be the first significant winter storm of the season for this
area.  Away from the mountains, an axis of heavy rainfall is
possible around and to the north of the surface low with some
mixing of snow not out of the question during the colder overnight
hours.  Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and
northern Plains by Wednesday and Thursday as the surface low
deepens.  Across the central and southern Plains, moderate to
locally heavy rainfall is possible and the Storm Prediction Center
is monitoring another threat for severe weather on Tuesday and/or
Wednesday depending on exact timing of the front that will extend
from the northern Plains low.  By Thursday-Friday there is some
potential for eastern Pacific tropical moisture to stream
northeastward and interact with the front to produce areas of
heavy rainfall.  However at this time confidence is low for
resolving the location and magnitude of any rainfall enhancement
from this tropical moisture.

Elsewhere, a leading system may bring a band of enhanced rainfall
to parts of the Midwest as it lifts northeastward.  The Pacific
Northwest should see mostly light precipitation with upstream
energy coming in from the Pacific through midweek.  An approaching
late week frontal system may increase amounts somewhat over the
Olympics and far northern Cascades.

The West will see its cold temperatures moderate by
Thursday-Friday with gradually shrinking coverage of minus 10-20F
anomalies for highs and morning lows.  Within the eastern U.S.
warmth, highest anomalies for max temperatures will be over the
Great Lakes/Northeast with highs tending to be 10-15F or so above
average.  An overwhelming majority of the East will see plus
10-20F anomalies for lows with some locations over/southwest of
the Great Lakes possibly even warmer Monday-Tuesday.  Such
readings may achieve daily records for warm lows over some areas.

...Heavy rain and the potential for flash flooding continues into
this morning across portions of the Southeast...

...Anomalous heat across the central/southern Plains will be
contrasted with mountain snows across the northern/central Rockies
into this weekend...

A slow-moving weather pattern across the eastern half of the
country continues to bring unsettled weather across the region.
The main focus of heavy rain will remain be over portions of the
Southeast this morning where moisture coming up from the Gulf of
Mexico will be lifted along a stationary front.  The threat of
heavy rainfall should gradually shift eastward into the Carolinas
later today where some locally heavy downpours are possible
although widespread heavy rain is not expected.  Farther north
across much of the Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley and into the
southern Appalachians, a slow-moving upper trough/low will help
trigger additional clusters of showers and thunderstorms
containing locally heavy downpours.  By the weekend, the rain is
forecast to edge further eastward toward the East Coast as a
coastal low pressure system is forecast to develop just off the
Carolina coasts where the National Hurricane Center is monitoring
of a low potential for tropical cyclone development.  By Saturday
night into Sunday morning, the threat of heavy rain and gusty
winds could increase near the North Carolina coast as the low
pressure wave may strengthen and edge closer toward the coast.

For central and south-central sections of the U.S. mainland, a
building ridge of high pressure aloft will bring the potential of
record-breaking heat beginning today and continuing into the
weekend, where high temperatures are forecast to soar into the 90s
across the central and southern Plains. These temperatures equate
to around 10 to 20 degrees above average with the warmest day
forecast to occur on Saturday.

Otherwise, a deep upper-level trough currently entering the West
Coast is expected to usher in below average temperatures and
chances for precipitation. Showers, thunderstorms, and high
elevation snow is likely to be found across parts of the
Intermountain West and Northern/Central Rockies over the next few
days. A few instances of flash flooding are possible between
northern Nevada and southeast Idaho. By Saturday, as a low
pressure system ejects into the Northern Plains, isolated severe
thunderstorms are not out of the question across eastern North
Dakota and northwest Minnesota.

weekend.  In fact, snow is forecast for the high elevations across
parts of the Intermountain West and northern/central Rockies.
Scattered showers and some thunderstorms are also expected for the
lower elevations.  By Saturday, a developing low pressure system
ejecting into the northern Plains will likely bring a period of
enhanced rainfall together with gusty winds across the region.
Isolated severe thunderstorms are not out of the question for
parts of the area especially Saturday night into early Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CST Fri Feb 18 2022

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

With temperatures having warmed faster than even the warmer/drier
guidance had forecast, it seems more likely that elevated to near
critical fire weather will occur for a longer duration than
initially expected. An elevated area was added to northwest Kansas
and southwest Nebraska. Fuels are quite dry in this region and will
support fire spread even with meteorological conditions that may
remain on the marginal side for some locations.

..Wendt.. 02/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CST Fri Feb 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
Within the northwesterly flow aloft across the western 2/3 of the
CONUS, a shortwave trough is forecast to traverse the Rockies and
move over the Plains by early this evening. At the surface, a weak
cold front will meander southward across the central High Plains
with westerly downslope flow developing behind it. While dry and
breezy conditions appear possible across portions of the High
Plains, uncertainty remains high regarding the potential for
sustained fire weather conditions.

...High Plains...
Westerly downslope flow will accompany a weak frontal passage early
in the day across portions of eastern CO, southern NE, and western
KS. 15-20 mph surface winds may briefly coincide with 25% surface RH
within the modest downslope flow regime. However, model guidance
shows the brunt of stronger winds will likely remain behind the
front, displaced from the lowest surface humidity. In addition to
concerns on the overlap of gusty winds and dry surface conditions,
recent snowfall may limit the availability of fine fuels. As such,
only brief, locally elevated fire weather conditions appear likely.
Fire weather concerns should remain local in nature.

...Heavy snow/ice threats across from northern Plains to northern
Maine Monday-Tuesday and southern Plains to Northeast
Wednesday-Friday...


...Pattern Overview...

A very active weather pattern is expected to develop by early next
week as an upper level trough digs across the Western U.S. with
ejecting energies and induced frontal waves progressing
downstream. The upper trough should shift eastward into the
Central Plains and Midwest by later next week as amplified ridging
builds over the East Pacific and West Coast. This very amplified
pattern results in a renewed heavy rain and flooding threat from
roughly the lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valley to the Mid-Atlantic
through most of next week, with a double dose of winter storm
potential -- first across the northern tier to far northern Maine
Monday and Tuesday, and again from the southern Plains to the
Northeast the second half of the week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement on the
overall large scale pattern described above through most of the
period. The amplifying trough during the early part of next week
over the West is showing better agreement in terms of timing
compared to previous days, though timing becomes a little more
uncertain later in the week as the shortwave energy slides into
the central Plains and the Midwest next Thursday-Friday. Despite
above average large scale agreement, the latest guidance continues
to offer plenty of uncertainty in the details, which will have
more significant impacts to heavy snow/rainfall potential across
much of the eastern half of the nation. Nothing notable stands out
at this time, as most of these differences are the typical
extended range model run to run variations anyways. By later next
week, there's indications an amplified ridge should be located
over the eastern Pacific, and possibly into parts of the West, but
quite a bit of disagreement on individual systems rounding the
top/eastern part of the ridge into western Canada and the
Northwest U.S..

WPCs blend for today used a majority deterministic model blend for
days 3-5. After this, increased the ensemble means to help
mitigate the smaller scale, harder to resolve, detail differences.
This approach maintains good continuity with the overnight WPC
package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely to focus early to mid
next week across the cooling West/Rockies as potent trough
energies dig into an amplified western U.S. upper trough position.
A wavy front on the leading edge of a cold surge set to dig into
the central U.S. early-mid next week will have upper support to
favor a swath of heavy snow from the northern plains/Upper Midwest
to northern Maine next Monday-Tuesday with some ice accumulations
possible along the southern edge. Meanwhile, ample upper energies
working downstream from the West next week will also act to induce
waves along a lead front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf
of Mexico. This is expected to fuel a heavy rain and flood threat
from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic
starting early next week along with potential for re-development
along the wavy/slowed trailing front later next week. This second
wave may also support a heavy snow/ice threat from parts of the
southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to a cold air
dammed Northeast Wednesday-Friday. Given detail uncertainties in
the guidance, confidence on exact snow/ice amounts and locations
remains very low at these longer lead times, but the potential is
there and the pattern certaintly supports a threat somewhere.

Arctic high pressure surging southward into the Central U.S.
during the first half of next week will support much below
temperatures from the Northwest into much of the Central U.S. as
far south as Texas. Especially from the northern High Plains to
the northern/central Plains, daytime highs and overnight lows
could be 30-40 below normal, which could approach to exceed record
low mins and max values. Daytime highs across the northern part of
this region could struggle to get above 0F Monday and Tuesday.
This cold should moderate somewhat by later next week and spread
eastward into the Mississippi Valley and parts of the Midwest.
Meanwhile, much above normal temperatures are expected across the
South and East early in the period (with some records possible,
especially overnight mins) as upper level ridging builds over the
region. Temperatures should moderate back to normal for the
Northeast next Thursday-Friday, but remain above normal for the
Southeast.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0112 PM CST Fri Feb 18 2022

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

The ongoing forecast remains primarily on track. Some adjustments to
the elevated area have been made where snow cover has lingered today
and should suppress fire concerns. The greatest potential for
briefly critical conditions will be within the southern High Plains
where temperatures will warm to potentially support pockets of 15%
RH. In the Mid-Atlantic, recent precipitation and generally brief
dry/windy conditions continue to preclude highlights. Gusty, dry
downslope winds appear probable in eastern Wyoming into the Nebraska
Panhandle. With recent snowfall, however, fine fuels will likely
only support localized fire weather concerns.

Very dry air will likely move into parts of eastern Nebraska as the
surface high shifts into the mid-Mississippi Valley. RH could fall
below 20% along with the presence of strong low-level winds. Fuels
remain very dry, but much cooler temperatures (upper 30s to low 40s
F) will likely keep fire concerns localized.

..Wendt.. 02/18/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CST Fri Feb 18 2022/

...Synopsis...
Northwesterly flow aloft across the CONUS will give way to more
zonal flow Saturday. A series of low-amplitude shortwave troughs
will cross the Rockies, enhancing lee troughing and forcing surface
high pressure eastward into the Ohio Valley. At the surface,
southerly return flow will strengthen, drawing a warm and dry
airmass northward across the Plains. Dry and breezy conditions will
favor elevated fire weather potential across portions of the High
Plains Saturday.

...High Plains...
Southerly surface winds will strengthen across the central and
southern High Plains Saturday in response to a deepening lee trough
and surface high pressure over the Ohio Valley. Efficient diurnal
heating/mixing and downslope flow will support RH minimums of 15-20
percent, where sustained southerly winds of 15-25 mph are expected.
This will likely result in elevated meteorological conditions across
a narrow strip of the central High Plains west of cooler
temperatures and returning surface moisture. Some uncertainty exists
regarding the availability of fine fuels across eastern CO given
recent light snowfall. While some fuels may be impacted, finer fuels
should recover quickly given the dry surface conditions and gusty
winds. As such, elevated highlights had been added for the expected
dry and breezy conditions supportive of fire weather concerns
Saturday afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A mid-level shortwave trough and accompanying strong flow aloft will
overspread the Mid-Atlantic with breezy/gusty westerly surface winds
likely across parts of VA, MD, and NC. Here, temperatures will climb
into the upper 40s to lower/middle 50s, and downslope trajectories
off the central Appalachians, combined with diurnal heating/mixing
could support minimum RH of 25-35 percent. Confidence is limited
regarding the temporal overlap of the breezy surface winds and low
RH minimums. A strong cold front will rapidly approach in the
afternoon potentially limiting the window for sustained fire weather
conditions. Recent precipitation may also limit fuel availability,
but at least brief locally elevated conditions may occur within the
drier fuels.

300 PM EST February 18 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating mid-level low pressure extending across the
northeastern and north-central lower 48 to the Four Corners region at the
beginning of the period. Mid-level low pressure is predicted to shift eastw=
ard
to the eastern half of the contiguous U.S. by the middle of the period befo=
re
transitioning to a fairly zonal pattern by the end of week-2. This pattern
supports enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures at the beginni=
ng
of the period, with increasing pattern uncertainty by the middle of the per=
iod
translating to significant uncertainty regarding this hazard potential
shifting
eastward across the lower 48 after the middle of week-2. A storm is predict=
ed
to form over the Bering Sea by the beginning of week-2, which may bring
unsettled weather to parts of Alaska, although no related hazards are
anticipated at this time.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the central
CONUS, Sat, Feb 26.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the central CO=
NUS
and Interior West, Sat, Feb 26.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the eastern h=

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 26 - FRIDAY MARCH 04: There is good multi-model
depiction
of a positively tilted mid-level trough that is forecast to extend from the
Upper Midwest to the Four Corners region at the beginning of the period. Th=
ere
are some differences in the details of the synoptic pattern, with the GEFS
ensemble mean having more expansive high pressure across much of the CONUS =
and
Canada compared to the ECMWF. These differences translate to the GEFS
reforecast tool indicating at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile extending from the Interior West to t=
he
eastern CONUS, whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool limits the region to the
Interior West into the Great Lakes region. A slight risk of much below norm=
al
temperatures is posted across much of the Interior West and central CONUS, =
Feb
26, where the ECMWF reforecast tool is in agreement with the GEFS regarding
this extreme cold signal. A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures=
 is
posted across parts of the central CONUS, Feb 26, where the reforecast tool=
s
indicate at least a 30% to 40% chance of minimum temperatures falling below
the
15th percentile, with the GEFS indicating higher probabilities than the ECM=
WF.
The 15th percentile ranges from around -10 Deg F across the Northern Tier t=
o
40
Deg F across the Southern Tier.



Model ensemble means indicate weakening of the mid-level pattern by day 9 (=
Feb
27), but is also accompanied by increasing differences regarding the detail=
s
of
the pattern. The GEFS and Canadian maintain the mid-level trough whereas th=
e
ECMWF limits this trough to mainly across the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, a=
nd
Northeast. This translates to the GEFS reforecast tool extending the covera=
ge
of increased potential for the extreme cold signal to Feb 27 across the
Southern Plains and eastern half of the CONUS, whereas the GEFS reforecast
tool
only shows New England reaching the aforementioned thresholds. Due to these
differences, only Feb 26 was included in the much below normal temperature
risk. The reforecast tools show a brief respite of widespread much below
normal
temperatures during the middle of the period associated with the weaker
mid-level pattern. By day 12 (Mar 2) model agreement increases, indicating
mid-level troughing forming across the western half of the CONUS, supportin=
g a
slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the region, Mar 2 to 3. T=
his
hazard is not extended beyond Mar 3 due to increasing differences regarding
the
potential for extreme cold by the end of the period.



There is good agreement in the models regarding a series of surface lows
during
week-2 that could bring windy conditions to portions of the western Aleutia=
ns
and western Mainland Alaska, especially at the beginning of the period.
However, the reforecast tools and recent deterministic guidance does not
support the inclusion of a related high wind hazard at this time. A warming
trend is likely throughout Alaska, beginning prior to week-2, with above
normal
temperatures favored to continue into the beginning of March. The reforecas=
t
tools show many parts of Mainland Alaska having at least a 20% chance of
maximum temperatures reaching the 85th percentile of the climatological
distribution during the period, with the highest probabilities (>40%) on da=
y 8
(Feb 26). Possible impacts from these anticipated much above normal
temperatures include travel difficulties and increased avalanche risk,
including roof avalanches, across the southern and southwestern Mainland.

...Low-pressure system will bring blizzard conditions to parts of
the northern Plains and Great Lakes region on Friday before moving
into the interior Northeast on Saturday...

...Next storm system arrives in the Pacific Northwest bringing
heavy snow, gusty winds, and bitterly cold temperatures...

...Tranquil conditions and warmer temperatures across the South...


The potent storm system that has brought heavy rain, severe
thunderstorms, snow, and strong winds across a large portion of
the country, has finally moved out to sea. In its wake, gusty
winds may persist along coastal sections of the Northeast with
wind gusts up to 45 mph, before subsiding during the Friday
evening hours. Temperatures across the region should remain below
average throughout the weekend before more spring-like warmth
arrives on Monday.

Meanwhile, another strong low-pressure system will move through
the northern Plains and Great Lakes regions during the Friday
afternoon and evening hours before progressing through the
interior Northeast on Saturday. With frigid air in place from the
antecedent cold front, light to moderate snow in tandem with
strong wind gusts up to 65 mph have resulted in Blizzard Warnings
in northern North Dakota, Minnesota, and the UP of Michigan.
Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility and
make travel extremely treacherous. However, along and behind the
cold front, narrow bands of snow squalls are likely to move
rapidly from northwest to southeast. These bands will be
accompanied by heavy snowfall rates of 1"/hour or more, gusty
winds which may exceed 50 mph, and extremely limited visibility.
This heavy snow and wind combination will likely create dangerous
travel and slippery roads and may impact the evening rush hour for
several major cities including Duluth, Minneapolis, and Green Bay.
The potential for snow squalls shifts into the Northeast on
Saturday with similar impacts such as heavy snow, strong wind
gusts and reduced visibilities possible.

Farther west, the next weather maker to impact the western and
central U.S. arrives on Saturday as an upper trough dives south
into the Northwest U.S. late Saturday into Sunday. A Pacific low
pressure system will introduce periods of coastal/valley rain and
heavy mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. As the
upper trough arrives in the Northwest on Sunday, periods of snow
will persist in the Cascades and northern Rockies. Winter Storm
Watches have been issued for the Washington and Oregon Cascades,
as well as the Blue Mountains of Washington and Oregon, through
Sunday evening due to the potential for snowfall totals ranging
between 12 and 18 inches. Snow will break out across the northern
Rockies and High Plains as an Arctic front moves south into the
North Central U.S. on Sunday. In addition to snow, temperatures
will take a nose dive in Montana where apparent temperatures will
go from the low-mid 50s in eastern Montana Saturday afternoon, to
being subzero by Sunday afternoon. This Arctic front will be
responsible for the return of frigid temperatures throughout the
northern High Plains and Upper Midwest next week.

In contrast, the warmest and most tranquil weather will be focused
across the southern tier of the U.S. This is due to a series of
high pressure systems located over the Deep South and into the
Southwest. Although parts of the Southeast and Mid-South will
start the first half of the weekend on the seasonally cold side,
most locations in these regions will rebound to milder levels by
Sunday. The warmest temperature anomalies will be focused in the
north-central Plains where they look to range between 10 and 20
degrees above normal.

The potent storm system that has brought heavy rain, severe
thunderstorms, snow, and strong winds across a large portion of
the country, has finally moved out to sea. In its wake, gusty
winds may persist along coastal sections of the Northeast with
wind gusts up to 45 mph, before subsiding during the Friday
evening hours. Temperatures across the region should remain below
average throughout the weekend before more spring-like warmth
arrives on Monday.

Meanwhile, another strong low-pressure system will move through
the northern Plains and Great Lakes regions during the Friday
afternoon and evening hours before progressing through the
interior Northeast on Saturday. With frigid air in place from the
antecedent cold front, light to moderate snow in tandem with
strong wind gusts up to 65 mph have resulted in Blizzard Warnings
in northern North Dakota, Minnesota, and the UP of Michigan.
Widespread blowing snow will significantly reduce visibility and
make travel extremely treacherous. However, along and behind the
cold front, narrow bands of snow squalls are likely to move
rapidly from northwest to southeast. These bands will be
accompanied by heavy snowfall rates of 1"/hour or more, gusty
winds which may exceed 50 mph, and extremely limited visibility.
This heavy snow and wind combination will likely create dangerous
travel and slippery roads and may impact the evening rush hour for
several major cities including Duluth, Minneapolis, and Green Bay.
The potential for snow squalls shifts into the Northeast on
Saturday with similar impacts such as heavy snow, strong wind
gusts and reduced visibilities possible.

Farther west, the next weather maker to impact the western and
central U.S. arrives on Saturday as an upper trough dives south
into the Northwest U.S. late Saturday into Sunday. A Pacific low
pressure system will introduce periods of coastal/valley rain and
heavy mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest on Saturday. As the
upper trough arrives in the Northwest on Sunday, periods of snow
will persist in the Cascades and northern Rockies. Winter Storm
Watches have been issued for the Washington and Oregon Cascades,
as well as the Blue Mountains of Washington and Oregon, through
Sunday evening due to the potential for snowfall totals ranging
between 12 and 18 inches. Snow will break out across the northern
Rockies and High Plains as an Arctic front moves south into the
North Central U.S. on Sunday. In addition to snow, temperatures
will take a nose dive in Montana where apparent temperatures will
go from the low-mid 50s in eastern Montana Saturday afternoon, to
being subzero by Sunday afternoon. This Arctic front will be
responsible for the return of frigid temperatures throughout the
northern High Plains and Upper Midwest next week.

In contrast, the warmest and most tranquil weather will be focused
across the southern tier of the U.S. This is due to a series of
high pressure systems located over the Deep South and into the
Southwest. Although parts of the Southeast and Mid-South will
start the first half of the weekend on the seasonally cold side,
most locations in these regions will rebound to milder levels by
Sunday. The warmest temperature anomalies will be focused in the
north-central Plains where they look to range between 10 and 20
degrees above normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri February 18 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 24 - 28 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in very good agreemen=
t in depicting an amplified
500-hPa mid-level flow pattern across the forecast domain during the next 6=
 to
10 days. A trough-ridge pattern is depicted across the North Pacific and
western North America, favoring below-normal mid-level heights across much =
of
the Aleutians and parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and above-normal
mid-level heights across the remainder of the state. Above-normal 500-hPa
heights are also predicted across much of the western CONUS, along the east=
ern
periphery of the predicted amplified ridge over the Northeast Pacific.
Downstream, an enhanced, positively-tilted trough is predicted over much of
the
central CONUS, leading to below-normal 500-hPa heights across the Central a=
nd
Northern Plains and Midwest, extending to northern parts of the Northeast.
Mean
mid-level ridging is forecast over the western Atlantic, leading to predict=
ed
above-normal heights across the Southeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for all of Alaska, associated with me=
an
southerly flow between the amplified trough and ridge over the Bering Sea a=
nd
the Northeast Pacific, respectively. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal
temperatures are favored from the west coast of the CONUS to the Mississipp=
i
Valley, extending northeastward to the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and
Northeast,
beneath an amplified, positively-tilted mean mid-level trough. Enhanced odd=
s
of
above-normal temperatures are indicated for parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic, due to predicted return flow to the west of a mean subtropica=
l
ridge over the Atlantic.

An active storm track ahead of a mean mid-level trough west of Alaska favor=
s
increased above-normal precipitation probabilities across southern Alaska.
Models agree well in depicting a slight weakness in the mean mid-level ridg=
e
over the Northeast Pacific, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs 6-10 day forecast,
indicating a potential split of the mid-level high pressure. This split, wi=
th
the largest height centers off the west coast of the CONUS and north of
Alaska,
indicates an increased potential for low pressure systems track into the
Pacific Northwest, leading to near to above-normal precipitation odds acros=
s
the northwestern CONUS. However, the positive mid-level height anomaly cent=
er
off the West Coast remains intrusive across the southwestern CONUS, favorin=
g
below-normal precipitation there. Downstream, surface low pressure over the
east-central CONUS is predicted to move eastward early in the 6-10 day peri=
od,
increasing odds of above-normal precipitation from the western Gulf Coast t=
o
the Northeast. Surface high pressure is forecast to dominate through much o=
f
the period in the wake of this low pressure system exiting the East Coast,
favoring a tilt in the odds toward below-normal precipitation in the centra=
l
CONUS. Below-normal precipitation is also favored across the Florida
Peninsula,
ahead of a mean frontal boundary over the Southeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions and =
forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 26 - MAR 04, 2022

The 500-hPa height pattern over the CONUS during week-2 is an eastward
progression from the 6-10 day period. A trough-ridge pattern is depicted
across
the North Pacific, favoring below-normal mid-level heights across much of t=
he
Aleutians and above-normal mid-level heights across the remainder of Alaska=
.
Downstream, positive mid-level height anomalies are favored across the West=
,
to
the east of the mean ridge over the Northeast Pacific and western North
America. Strong mean troughing is predicted across the east-central CONUS, =
but
is displaced northward relative to the 6-10 day period, favoring negative
500-hPa height anomalies from the Northern Plains to the Northeast. Positiv=
e
mid-level height anomalies over the Southern Tier are associated with a mea=
n
subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.

Enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities are favored for all of Alas=
ka,
associated with mean southerly flow. Increased odds of above-normal
temperatures along the West Coast of the CONUS are associated with increasi=
ng
mid-level heights during week-2 as the mid-level ridge over the Northeast
Pacific shifts eastward. Below-normal temperature probabilities are enhance=
d
across much of the remainder of the CONUS, as surface high pressure is
predicted to dominate through much of the period. Ahead of a mean frontal
boundary, odds tilt toward above-normal temperatures across the southern
Florida Peninsula.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of southern
and
western Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians, underneath enhanced
southwesterly flow, leading to elevated probabilities of above-normal
precipitation. Similar to the 6-10 day outlook, a weakness in the mean
mid-level ridge over the Northeast Pacific and western North America is als=
o
evident. The weakness in the ridge indicates an increased potential for low
pressure systems to track across the Pacific Northwest, leading to increase=
d
above-normal precipitation probabilities across the northwestern CONUS.
Below-normal precipitation is most likely across the southwestern CONUS, wh=
ere
stronger above-normal mid-level heights are favored. Below-normal
precipitation
is also favored across much of the eastern CONUS, associated with predicted
mean surface high pressure. Odds tilt toward above-normal precipitation acr=
oss
parts of southern Texas, where mean easterly flow is expected to provide a
suitable moisture source for systems that potentially develop along the mea=
n
frontal boundary along the Gulf Coast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation fields i=
n
the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 21 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 25 2022

...Increasing confidence in a southern U.S. heavy rainfall event
with northern tier heavy snows...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00z/06z cycle, model guidance continues to show very
good agreement with the large scale pattern into the middle of
next week, though with some lingering uncertainty in the smaller
scale details. A compact upper low likely west of Baja California
to begin the period Sunday should weaken as it moves eastward,
with good consensus as well on the large scale for energy to spill
into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge by next
Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly eastward.
00z/06z models showed somewhat better agreement on Western trough
timing, with the 00z ECMWF adjusting westward with its axis, more
in line with the GFS. However, the 12z ECMWF again slowed down a
little bit with the axis, while the 12z CMC is faster than its
previous run. So, questions on timing continue to loom late
period. Additionally, the evolution of upstream energy is rather
uncertain stemming from high latitudes and rounding the Pacific
ridge, leading to low confidence in the specifics of the embedded
energies within the main trough and its eventual movement,
especially by day 7. The past few runs of the GFS has been quite
sharp and fast with the next shortwave into the Pacific Northwest
next Thursday, but the 12z run looks more reasonable and in line
with the ECMWF/CMC.

The WPC blend for todays progs featured a multi deterministic
model solution for days 3-5 amidst above average agreement. For
days 6 and 7, the ensemble means were phased into the blend with
increasing proportions to help account for the uncertainties in
the Western U.S. trough timing and mitigate the smaller scale
details. The resulting solution provides a middle ground solution
for the trough and maintains good continuity with the overnight
WPC package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and moderate to heavy mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies and persisting there into the middle
of next week. As the western trough deepens, it should tap into
Gulf of Mexico moisture to fuel a heavy to possibly excessive
rainfall event from portions of the lower Mississippi Valley into
the Tennessee Valley during the early to middle part of next week.
A multi-day event over roughly the same areas is possible as
additional energy gets reloaded into the trough out West. This
likely increases the threat for flooding and flash flooding into
at least next Wednesday. SPC continues to mention the threat for
severe weather within this pattern as well across parts of the
South. On the north side of this system, confidence is increasing
that a swath of moderate to heavy snowfall will be present
stretching from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday and Tuesday, and eventually affecting parts of far
northern New England as well, though the exact axis of heavy snows
remains somewhat uncertain.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30-40 degrees below
normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday

...Increasing confidence in a southern U.S. heavy rainfall event
with northern tier heavy snows...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00z/06z cycle, model guidance continues to show very
good agreement with the large scale pattern into the middle of
next week, though with some lingering uncertainty in the smaller
scale details. A compact upper low likely west of Baja California
to begin the period Sunday should weaken as it moves eastward,
with good consensus as well on the large scale for energy to spill
into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge by next
Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly eastward.
00z/06z models showed somewhat better agreement on Western trough
timing, with the 00z ECMWF adjusting westward with its axis, more
in line with the GFS. However, the 12z ECMWF again slowed down a
little bit with the axis, while the 12z CMC is faster than its
previous run. So, questions on timing continue to loom late
period. Additionally, the evolution of upstream energy is rather
uncertain stemming from high latitudes and rounding the Pacific
ridge, leading to low confidence in the specifics of the embedded
energies within the main trough and its eventual movement,
especially by day 7. The past few runs of the GFS has been quite
sharp and fast with the next shortwave into the Pacific Northwest
next Thursday, but the 12z run looks more reasonable and in line
with the ECMWF/CMC.

The WPC blend for todays progs featured a multi deterministic
model solution for days 3-5 amidst above average agreement. For
days 6 and 7, the ensemble means were phased into the blend with
increasing proportions to help account for the uncertainties in
the Western U.S. trough timing and mitigate the smaller scale
details. The resulting solution provides a middle ground solution
for the trough and maintains good continuity with the overnight
WPC package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and moderate to heavy mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies and persisting there into the middle
of next week. As the western trough deepens, it should tap into
Gulf of Mexico moisture to fuel a heavy to possibly excessive
rainfall event from portions of the lower Mississippi Valley into
the Tennessee Valley during the early to middle part of next week.
A multi-day event over roughly the same areas is possible as
additional energy gets reloaded into the trough out West. This
likely increases the threat for flooding and flash flooding into
at least next Wednesday. SPC continues to mention the threat for
severe weather within this pattern as well across parts of the
South. On the north side of this system, confidence is increasing
that a swath of moderate to heavy snowfall will be present
stretching from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday and Tuesday, and eventually affecting parts of far
northern New England as well, though the exact axis of heavy snows
remains somewhat uncertain.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30-40 degrees below
normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday
and Tuesday, with cold temperatures lingering through Wednesday
and Thursday as well.

...Heavy to excessive rain threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valley to the Mid-Atlantic Tuesday-Friday...

...Heavy snow/ice threats from the Upper Midwest to Maine Tuesday
and southern Plains to Northeast Wednesday-Saturday...


...Pattern Overview...

A very active weather pattern is expected to develop by early next
week over our fine nation as an upper level trough digs across the
Western U.S. with ejecting energies and induced frontal waves
progressing downstream. The upper trough should shift eastward
into the Central Plains and Midwest by later next week as
amplified ridging builds over the East Pacific and West Coast.
This amplified pattern results in a renewed heavy rain and
flooding threat from roughly the lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic through most of next week. There is
also a double dose of winter storm potential with a leading swath
from the Upper Midwest to Maine Tuesday, then broadly from the
southern Plains to the Northeast Wednesday into Saturday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest models and ensembles continue an ongoing recent trend
to offer quite similar mid-larger scale flow evolutions in a
medium range pattern with overall above normal predictability. A
composite of generally well clustered guidance from the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the National Blend of Models
(NBM) seemingly provides a good forecast basis for days 3-5
(Tuesday-Thursday). This solution is well supported by GEFS/ECMWF
ensembles. The WPC product suite was then mainly derived from the
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and NBM into days 6/7 in a period with
gradulaly growing model forecast spread. This broad strategy tends
to mitigate lingering smaller scale system variances while
maintaining good WPC product continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely to focus early to mid
next week across the cooling West/Rockies as potent upper trough
energies dig into the West as enhanced by post-frontal upslope
fetch. The wavy front on the leading edge of a cold surge set to
dig into the central U.S. early-mid next week will have upper
support to favor a swath of heavy snow from the Upper Midwest to
Maine Tuesday with some ice accumulations possible along the
southern edge. Meanwhile, ample upper energies working downstream
from the West next week will also act to induce waves along a lead
front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This is
expected to fuel a heavy rain and experimental "slight" ERO flood
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic starting early next week along with potential for
periodic re-development and training along the wavy/slowed
trailing front through later next week. A main second wave
evolution may also support the spread of a heavy snow/ice threat
from parts of the southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
and into a cold air dammed northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Wednesday into Saturday. Given lingering detail uncertainties in
the guidance, confidence on exact snow/ice amounts and locations
remains less certain at these longer lead times, but the potential
is there in this favorable pattern.

Arctic high pressure surging southward into the Central U.S.
during the first half of next week will support much below
temperatures from the Northwest into much of the Central U.S. as
far south as Texas. Especially from the northern High Plains to
the northern/central Plains, daytime highs and overnight lows
could be 30-40 below normal, which could approach to exceed record
low mins and max values. Daytime highs across the northern part of
this region could struggle to get above 0F Tuesday. This very cold
air will spread, but gradually modify later next week across the
Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above normal pre-frontal
temperatures are expected across the Southeast/East early in the
period (with some records possible, especially overnight mins)
with upper level ridging over the region.

energies dig into the West as enhanced by post-frontal upslope
fetch. The wavy front on the leading edge of a cold surge set to
dig into the central U.S. early-mid next week will have upper
support to favor a swath of heavy snow from the Upper Midwest to
Maine Tuesday with some ice accumulations possible along the
southern edge. Meanwhile, ample upper energies working downstream
from the West next week will also act to induce waves along a lead
front and tap deepening moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. This is
expected to fuel a heavy rain and experimental "slight" ERO flood
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic starting early next week along with potential for
periodic re-development and training along the wavy/slowed
trailing front through later next week. A main second wave
evolution may also support the spread of a heavy snow/ice threat
from parts of the southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys
and into a cold air dammed northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
Wednesday into Saturday. Given lingering detail uncertainties in
the guidance, confidence on exact snow/ice amounts and locations
remains less certain at these longer lead times, but the potential
is there in this favorable pattern.

Arctic high pressure surging southward into the Central U.S.
during the first half of next week will support much below
temperatures from the Northwest into much of the Central U.S. as
far south as Texas. Especially from the northern High Plains to
the northern/central Plains, daytime highs and overnight lows
could be 30-40 below normal, which could approach to exceed record
low mins and max values. Daytime highs across the northern part of
this region could struggle to get above 0F Tuesday. This very cold
air will spread, but gradually modify later next week across the
Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above normal pre-frontal
temperatures are expected across the Southeast/East early in the
period (with some records possible, especially overnight mins)
with upper level ridging over the region.

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a low-amplitude shortwave trough is forecast to
move across the northern Rockies within strong zonal flow. The
westerly winds crossing the Rockies will enhance surface lee
troughing in the central High Plains, while surface high pressure
over the Ohio Valley will enhance dry return flow across the
southern Plains. Warming temperatures and gusty winds within the dry
air mass will support elevated to near critical fire weather across
parts of the High Plains.

...Central and southern High Plains...
As the lee trough strengthens through the early morning and
afternoon, low-level west-southwesterly flow will increase across
the central High Plains. The dry downslope winds and warming
temperatures will support low relative humidity of 15-25% through
the afternoon. While some snow cover remains (especially across
eastern WY and northern CO), the dry air mass and warming
temperatures should sublimate/melt the lesser snow pack farther
east. Fuels remain very dry and fuel moisture is likely to be only
marginally affected. Thus, widespread elevated fire weather
conditions are likely through the afternoon.

Farther south across the OK/TX Panhandles and northeastern NM, more
southerly low-level flow is expected along the western periphery of
the surface high pressure over the Ohio Valley. A remnant nocturnal
low-level jet will support surface winds of 15-25 mph coincident
with surface RH of 15-20%. Fuels here remain quite dry and support
fire spread. Widespread elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely through much of the day with some localized critical
conditions also possible across the OK/TX Panhandles. Greater
uncertainty exists on the possibility of critical conditions given
the limited model guidance overlap of stronger surface winds and
critical RH.

...Mid Atlantic...
A mid-level shortwave trough and accompanying strong flow aloft will
overspread the Mid-Atlantic, with breezy/gusty westerly surface
winds likely across parts of VA, MD, and NC ahead of a fast moving
arctic cold front. Daytime temperatures in the 40s to 50s, and
downslope flow in the lee of the central Appalachians, may support
minimum RH of 25-35 percent. Confidence is low regarding the
temporal overlap of the breezy surface winds and low RH. Recent
precipitation may also limit fuel availability though some drying is
expected. The cold front will rapidly approach in the afternoon
potentially limiting the window for sustained fire weather
conditions. While no areas will be added, brief locally elevated
conditions may occur within the drier fuels.

...Eastern Nebraska...
Very dry air will likely move into parts of eastern NE and western
IA as the surface high shifts into the mid-Mississippi Valley.
Surface RH may briefly fall below 25% along with gusty low-level
winds. Fuels remain very dry, but much cooler temperatures (upper
30s to low 40s F) will likely keep fire concerns localized.

...Strong winds and snow squalls over parts of the Northeast on
Saturday...

...Heavy snow for the Cascades Saturday into Monday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Northern Tier States by Monday morning...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes/Northeast
southwestward to the Middle Mississippi Valley will move eastward
off the East Coast by Saturday evening. The system will produce
light to moderate snow to the Northeast and light snow over the
Central Appalachians. The powerful Arctic cold front will race
across the Northeast Saturday, exiting the New England Coast
Saturday evening. Along and behind the front, narrow bands of snow
squalls will move rapidly from northwest to southeast. These bands
will be accompanied by heavy snowfall rates of 1"/hr or more,
gusty winds which may exceed 50 mph and extremely limited
visibility. The brief heavy snow and wind combination will likely
create dangerous travel conditions as the front moves through.
Temperatures will drop quickly behind the front leading to a rapid
refreeze of wet roadways. In addition, lake effect snow will
develop downwind from Lakes Superior and Michigan, ending by
Saturday late afternoon.

Meanwhile, a fast-moving area of low pressure over Western Canada
will move into the Northern Plains overnight Saturday. The system
will move into the Upper Great Lakes by Sunday morning, moving
northeastward into Eastern Canada by Monday. As a result, light
snow will develop along the U. S./Canadian border from the
Northern Rockies to the Upper Great Lakes early Sunday morning to
Sunday afternoon. Very cold high pressure will build in over the
Rockies to the Great Lakes. The associated upslope flow will aid
in producing moderate snow over the Northern Rockies from Sunday
afternoon into Monday morning. The cold high pressure will bring
Temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below average over the Northern Tier
States by Monday morning.

Additionally, a weak front will move into the Pacific Northwest on
Saturday evening into Sunday morning. The system will produce
coastal rain and higher elevation snow from late Saturday
afternoon into Sunday. Onshore flow will keep the coastal rain and
higher elevation snow continuing into Monday. The heavy snow will
be a multiple-day event for the Cascades.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow is forecast to become increasingly southwesterly over
the Rockies and Plains Sunday as a Pacific trough begins to deepen
across the western US. Warm southerly flow aided by lee troughing
will overspread the southern High Plains along with low relative
humidity. Dry conditions, gusty winds and ongoing drought will
support critical fire weather potential.

...Southern High Plains...
As the zonal flow over the Rockies gradually becomes more
southwesterly ahead of the developing trough, broad lee troughing
will intensify Sunday with a surface cyclone emerging across
southeastern CO by midday. Low-level winds should increase
accordingly with the stronger pressure gradients driving
west-southwesterly downslope flow across the southern High Plains.
Surface winds of 20-30 mph are expected through the afternoon. The
strong winds will coincide with a low-level thermal ridge supporting
surface RH values of 10-20% from eastern NM, through the TX
Panhandle, and into portions of western OK. Fuels remain very dry
across much of the southern High Plains due to ongoing drought. This
will favor widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions
across portions of the southern High Plains.

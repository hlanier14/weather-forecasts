Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1037 AM CST Sun Jan 16 2022

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

With sunny skies in place, boundary-layer mixing will support 15-20
percent RH across the southern High Plains this afternoon. Surface
winds are expected to remain weak on a widespread basis, precluding
fire weather highlights. However, several guidance members suggest
that locally Elevated conditions may still occur in terrain-favoring
areas, particularly across the Permian Basin in western Texas.

..Squitieri.. 01/16/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1253 AM CST Sun Jan 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will quickly progress from the northern Rockies
into the lower Mississippi Valley today. Weak surface troughing will
occur in the southern Plains as a result. A dry airmass will still
be present across the southern High Plains region. Though winds are
expected to remain weak, a few areas of locally elevated fire
weather may occur around terrain features.

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 19 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 23 2022

...Cooled South to East Coast Snow/Ice Threat with frontal/coastal
low genesis late week...

...Pattern Overview...

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream
impulses carve out and reinforce a large mean trough downstream
over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes
into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the next tending
to dig more sharply into the South Friday and up off the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast Saturday. There is significant
forecast spread and run to run uncertainty with this latter
feature and associated mid-winter weather focus with frontal
wave/coastal low genesis.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a model
and ensemble composite days 3-7. There is good agreement with an
organized low pressure system set to dig into the north-central
U.S. and subsequently track moving eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the
Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally higher totals
expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold high pressure
sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the
low in a pattern with above normal predictability for these
features. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies
however with potential focus due to ample run to run trough
track/separation uncertainty aloft later week into the weekend.
The pattern offers potential into later week for an enhanced swath
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. A
cluster of multi-model ensemble members along with in particular
the 18 UTC GFS and now the latest 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian models,
are much more robust with frontal wave to coastal low/storm
genesis and mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and
up the East Coast at these longer time periods. However, the 00
UTC GFS has backed off. The preferred model and composite trends
WPC product continuity toward more organized and closer to the
coast genesis and track, but at this point not as strong as some
of the models. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

...Cooled South to East Coast Snow/Ice Threat with frontal/coastal
low genesis late week...

...Pattern Overview...

A mean upper ridge will amplify along/off the West Coast by
mid-later week. This will allow a series of northern stream
impulses carve out and reinforce a large mean trough downstream
over the central to eastern U.S. later week into the weekend. Of
the main shortwaves, the first should slide over the Great Lakes
into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the next tending
to dig more sharply into the South Friday and up off the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast Saturday. There is significant
forecast spread and run to run uncertainty with this latter
feature and associated mid-winter weather focus with frontal
wave/coastal low genesis.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

The WPC medium range product suite was mainly derived from a model
and ensemble composite days 3-7. There is good agreement with an
organized low pressure system set to dig into the north-central
U.S. and subsequently track moving eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the
Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally higher totals
expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold high pressure
sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the
low in a pattern with above normal predictability for these
features. The wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain some Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area
of precipitation up from the South/Southeast. Guidance varies
however with potential focus due to ample run to run trough
track/separation uncertainty aloft later week into the weekend.
The pattern offers potential into later week for an enhanced swath
of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. A
cluster of multi-model ensemble members along with in particular
the 18 UTC GFS and now the latest 00 UTC ECMWF/Canadian models,
are much more robust with frontal wave to coastal low/storm
genesis and mid-winter precipitation extent across the region and
up the East Coast at these longer time periods. However, the 00
UTC GFS has backed off. The preferred model and composite trends
WPC product continuity toward more organized and closer to the
coast genesis and track, but at this point not as strong as some
of the models. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

...Cooled South to East Coast Snow/Ice Threat with frontal/coastal
low genesis late week...

...Pattern Overview...

A series of impulses will carve out and reinforce a broad mean
trough over the central and eastern states during the extended
period while the upper ridge amplifies offshore the West Coast.
The leading shortwave will track over the Great Lakes region into
the Northeast by Thursday with one behind it digging into the
South Friday and then pulling offshore the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast
region Saturday. This pattern will be conducive for precipitation
to spread across the higher terrain of the Northern and Central
Rockies through Friday and precipitation to span from
Texas/western Gulf Coast, Deep South, Southeast to the
Mid-Atlantic and push eastward beyond the weekend into next early
next week.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

Previously, it was noted that there is significant forecast spread
and run to run uncertainty with this latter feature and associated
mid-winter weather focus with frontal wave/coastal low genesis.
The 06Z/12Z guidance continues to have notable spread on the
placement/track of the secondary shortwave feature. In turn, the
QPF placement varies significantly as well, especially across the
Gulf states, Southeast and Southern Appalachia. To combat these
differences, a general blend of the GFS/GEFS mean/CMC/ECWMF/EC
ensemble means were used through all time periods. This provide a
middle ground approach and helped maintain continuity from the
previous forecast cycle.

There is good agreement with an organized low pressure system set
to dig into the north-central U.S. and subsequently track moving
eastward along the U.S./Canadian border through Thursday. This
should bring some snow to the Great Lakes then northern New
England, with locally higher totals expected near typical lake
enhancement areas as cold high pressure sweeps down across the
central and eastern U.S. in the wake of the low in a pattern with
above normal predictability for these features. As the Arctic
blast reaches the southern tier states a wavy cold front will
encounter Gulf moisture to fuel an emerging area of precipitation
up from the South/Southeast. This pattern will be favorable for an
enhanced swath of overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery
of activity later in the week. This wave may develop into a robust
coastal low/winter storm that tracks up the East Coast.
Meanwhile, The West could see some light precipitation through the
period, particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the
Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross the region, with
mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

Despite overall weaker upper support, adequate boundary-layer mixing
is expected foster 15 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds
amid 15-20 percent RH by afternoon peak heating tomorrow/Monday, as
also shown by the latest guidance consensus. While the more
widespread Elevated conditions across eastern New Mexico into
extreme southwest Kansas are expected to only last a few hours,
fuels across the region are near-critical to critically dry (80-90th
percentile forecast ERCs). Elevated highlights have been introduced
mainly due to the more widespread 15 mph winds and very dry fuels.

..Squitieri.. 01/16/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CST Sun Jan 16 2022/

...Synopsis...
Weak shortwave ridging will break down during the day on Monday
across the Four Corners. Modest to moderate mid-level northwesterly
winds across the Divide will promote some degree of lee troughing
during the afternoon in the High Plains. The airmass across the
region should remain quite dry. Areas of locally elevated fire
weather conditions will be possible from east-central New Mexico
into the Texas Panhandle. Given the generally weak lee trough as
well as potential for high-level clouds to decrease boundary-layer
mixing, such conditions are expected to remain localized and brief.

...A deep low pressure system will continue to spread heavy snow
northward across the upper Ohio Valley through the lower Great
Lakes and the higher elevations of New England through Monday...

...Snow will change over to a period of sleet/freezing rain before
changing over to rain across interior Mid-Atlantic and the lower
elevations of New England...

...Some heavy downpours, thunderstorms, and high winds can be
expected to impact the coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic up
through New England into Monday...

A low pressure system continues to expand and intensify as it
moves across the southeastern U.S. and begins to turn toward the
northeast up the Eastern Seaboard.  Arctic air already in place
across the central and eastern U.S.
will work in concert with this dynamic system to deliver a wide
swath of more than a foot of heavy snow northward across the upper
Ohio Valley through the lower Great Lakes as the storm center is
forecast to track up the interior section of the East Coast
through Monday.  Closer to the track of the storm center, snow
that initially fall is expected to change over to a period of
sleet and/or freezing rain before changing over to plain rain
across interior Mid-Atlantic and up through the lower elevations
of New England.  Along the spine of the Appalachians, snow is
forecast to change over to a period of sleet and/or freezing rain
as the storm center approaches.  The frozen precipitation should
then change back to snow following the passage of the storm
center.  Heavy wet snow is expected across the higher elevations
of New England through much of Monday.  Near the immediate coast,
some heavy downpours, thunderstorms, and high winds can be
expected to precede the storm center as it tracks up the
Mid-Atlantic through New England into Monday.

The center of the deep low pressure system is forecast to move
into southeastern Canada Monday night.  This will change the
precipitation to all snow followed by gradual tapering off of the
snow Monday night.  Much improved weather is expected to arrive on
Tuesday for the Northeast but the size of the departing system
will keep winds blustery.

Meanwhile, a boundary over Central Canada will move into the Upper
Midwest by Sunday evening. The system will produce light snow over
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes
for Sunday and begin to wane by Monday evening. By Tuesday
morning, a wave of low pressure over the Northern High Plains will
move into the Northern Plains. Light snow will develop across the
parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains into the
Northern Plains overnight Monday into Tuesday morning. The snow
will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Weak onshore flow and approaching upper-level energy will develop
light rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest Monday evening into Tuesday. Moreover, upper-level
energy will move over California producing scattered areas of rain
Monday evening into Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun January 16 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
333 PM EST Sun Jan 16 2022

Valid 00Z Mon Jan 17 2022 - 00Z Wed Jan 19 2022

...A deep low pressure system will continue to spread heavy snow
northward across the upper Ohio Valley through the lower Great
Lakes and the higher elevations of New England through Monday...

...Snow will change over to a period of sleet/freezing rain before
changing over to rain across interior Mid-Atlantic and the lower
elevations of New England...

...Some heavy downpours, thunderstorms, and high winds can be
expected to impact the coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic up
through New England into Monday...

A low pressure system continues to expand and intensify as it
moves across the southeastern U.S. and begins to turn toward the
northeast up the Eastern Seaboard.  Arctic air already in place
across the central and eastern U.S. will work in concert with this
dynamic system to deliver a wide swath of more than a foot of
heavy snow northward across the upper Ohio Valley through the
lower Great Lakes, as the storm center is forecast to track up the
interior section of the East Coast through Monday.  Closer to the
track of the storm center, snow that initially falls is expected
to change over to a period of sleet and/or freezing rain before
changing over to plain rain across interior Mid-Atlantic and up
through the lower elevations of New England.  Along the spine of
the Appalachians, snow is forecast to change over to a period of
sleet and/or freezing rain as the storm center approaches.  The
mixed precipitation should then change back to snow following the
passage of the storm center.  Heavy wet snow is expected across
the higher elevations of New England through much of Monday.  Near
the immediate coast, some heavy downpours, possibly thunderstorms,
together with high winds can be expected to precede the storm
center as it tracks up the Mid-Atlantic through New England into
Monday.

The center of the deep low pressure system is forecast to move
into southeastern Canada Monday night.  This will change the
precipitation to all snow followed by gradual tapering off of the
snow Monday night.  Much improved weather is expected to arrive on
Tuesday for the Northeast but the size of the departing system
will keep winds blustery.

Meanwhile, a cold front across southern Canada will dip toward the
northern Plains.  An Alberta clipper is forecast to form on the
front on Monday and then move toward the Great Lakes on Tuesday.
Lingering snow across the Great Lakes will pick up in intensity on
Tuesday as the clipper approaches.  Farther west, accumulating
snow is also forecast across northern Minnesota and northeastern
North Dakota.  Arctic air behind the cold front will then surge
into the northern Plains on Tuesday.  Upslope snow is forecast to
develop and intensify over the northern High Plains into the
northern Rockies on Tuesday as an arctic high pressure system
slides down from western Canada.

Weak onshore flow combined with upper-level energy will develop
light rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest Monday evening into Tuesday.  Moreover, lingering
upper-level energy slowly approaching California from the Pacific
is forecast to produce scattered areas of rain Monday evening into
Tuesday for southern California.  Meanwhile, a new low pressure
system is forecast to form over the southern Plains on Tuesday.
No rainfall is expected with this system.  In fact, dry conditions
with a warming trend is forecast for southern Plains on Tuesday.

...Cooled Deep South to East Coast Snow/Ice threats with uncertain
wave genesis pattern...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Hazards...

Major model differences persist in a data sensitive pattern with
rampant run to run continuity issues days 3-7. Instead of chasing
uncertain shortwaves, the WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from the 01 UTC National Blend of Models and a
composite blend of the 18 UTC GEFS/12 UTC ECMWF ensemble means
whose reasonably compatible solutions lessen detail consistent
with a pattern with lower than normal embedded system
predictability. Manual adjustments were applied to incorporate as
much WPC system continuity as feasible.

...Pattern Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deepened low and wrapping snows/winds is slated to exit the
Northeast Day 3/Thu as a massive Arctic high spreads across much
of the central and eastern CONUS. Cold air flow also favor lake
effect snow. A continuing series of uncertain impulses will carve
out and reinforce the large mean upper trough over the central and
eastern U.S. through this forecast period, digging downstream of
an amplified upper ridge position just offshore the West Coast.
This pattern will be conducive for periods with snow to spread
across the Northern and Central Rockies Thu/Fri, and beyond that
for uncertain periods of shortwave/frontal wave enhanced
precipitation to span from Texas/western Gulf Coast through the
Deep South and Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic/East Coast. This
includes threats for snow/ice on the northern periphery of
activity across the South/Southeast and potentially up the
Appalachians/East Coast to the U.S. northern tier/Northeast given
the extent of cold air intrusions and with uncertain systems
rotating through the mean upper trough position. However, ample
forecast spread and continuity issues limits predictability of
particular system threats days 4-7.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 AM CST Mon Jan 17 2022

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Modest northwesterly flow across the Rockies will promote weak lee
troughing in the southern High Plains. Winds will generally remain
light, around 15 mph, though locally higher speeds of near 20 mph
may occur. The airmass within the region will remain quite dry and
10-20% RH will be possible by the afternoon. Elevated fire weather
is forecast due to dry fuels. Fire weather concerns across the rest
of the CONUS appear minimal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CST Mon Jan 17 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low off the coast of California will transition into
an open wave and move into the Southwest on Tuesday. This feature is
forecast to help deepen a lee trough/cyclone in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains vicinity. Farther north, a more potent upper
trough will move into the northern Plains with an attendant cold
front moving southward to near the Red River by Wednesday morning.

...East-central New Mexico into Texas South Plains and Rolling
Plains...
Surface winds will increase during the day and into the afternoon as
the surface low deepens in response to the approaching upper trough.
Sustained winds could reach 20-25 mph. Flow within the lowest 2 km
will also be moderately strong and support wind gusts up to 30-35
mph. RH remains a bit uncertain during the afternoon. All models
show an increase in 850-700 mb moisture during the day and a
subsequent impact on low-level RH. RH of 15-20% appears most
probable, but locally lower values could occur. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather is expected during the afternoon given the dry
fuels.

...Central High Plains...
A brief window of elevated conditions is possible behind the cold
front. The colder air will lag the wind shift and RH may dip to
around 15% in some locations. Winds between 15-20 mph are most
likely. Areas of dry fuels will support fire spread.

...Heavy snow for parts of the Lower Great Lakes, Central
Appalachians, and the Northeast on Monday...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Upper Great Lakes on Tuesday...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern High Plains and the Southern Rockies on Monday...

A strong storm over the Northeast will move into Southeastern
Canada by Tuesday. On Monday, the system will produce heavy snow
over parts of the Lower Great Lakes, Central Appalachians, and the
Northeast. Rain will develop over the coastal and inland portions
of Southern/Northern New England on Monday, too. By Tuesday
morning, scattered areas of light snow will linger over parts of
the Central Appalachians to the higher elevations of the Northeast.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Upper Great Lakes to the
Northern High Plains will linger over the Upper Great Lakes
through Tuesday morning, producing light snow over parts of the
Upper Great Lakes through Tuesday. By Tuesday morning, a wave of
low pressure over West-Central Canada will move southeastward to
the Northern Plains. The low will move eastward across the Great
Lakes overnight Tuesday and into Ontario, Canada, by Wednesday
morning. The associated front will advance southward to the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley and eastward to the Great
Lakes to Ohio, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys from Tuesday into
Wednesday. The system will produce heavy snow across parts of
Upper Mississippi Valley, near Lake Superior, and Michigan s Upper
Peninsula on Tuesday into Wednesday. Light snow will move into
parts of the Lower Great Lakes/Northeast overnight Tuesday.

The western portion of the front will produce light snow over
parts of the Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains on Tuesday
and extend into the Central Rockies by Monday morning.
Furthermore, weak onshore flow will produce light rain over parts
of the Pacific Northwest and some snow at the higher elevations
from late Monday afternoon into late Tuesday night. In addition,
overnight Tuesday, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will
start to pool along the boundary over the eastern portion of the
front, developing rain over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys
and the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.

On another note, Monday, warm temperatures, gusty wind, and dry
fuels have led to an area of Elevated Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Southern High Plains and the Southern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1132 AM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

The ongoing fire weather outlook for today remains on track with no
changes needed.  Sustained surface wind speeds already exceed 15 mph
this morning across north-central Montana with gusts around 30 mph,
as enhanced flow aloft begins to overspread the area.  While high
clouds will limit heating and critical RH potential, elevated fire
weather conditions are likely. See previous discussion (below) for
more details.

..Jirak.. 08/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough over the central Rockies will eject eastward into
the central Plains while a second shortwave trough moves onshore
across the Pacific Northwest and southern Canada. At the surface, a
weak cold front will shift eastward with the trough, while a
secondary cold front moves south out of Canada into Montana. Ahead
of the front, strong westerly winds in the lee of the Cascades and
northern Rockies may support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
As the shortwave trough across the Pacific Northwest continues
eastward, increasing mid-level flow is forecast to overspread much
of Montana by early afternoon. Amplified surface momentum transfer
and a strengthening area of low pressure to the northwest should
support an increase in westerly surface winds to 15-25 mph by early
afternoon. Lift ahead of the trough will bring widespread mid and
high-level cloud cover which may serve to limit diurnal heating
somewhat. Despite this, the strong winds coincident with daily RH
minimums near 25% should support elevated fire weather conditions
given dry fuels across the northern Rockies and Plains.

...Cascade Gaps...
Westerly flow largely orthogonal to the Cascades ahead of the trough
should favor moderate gap winds and downsloping along much of the
range through the day. Modified by cloud cover and the maritime
airmass, surface RH values are not expected to be much below 35%.
However, strong winds greater than 20 mph may periodically spill
into the lower basins through the day supporting localized fire
weather concerns where pockets of lower humidity and dry fuels
exist.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek onward...

...Overview...

Most guidance expects an upper ridge tracking from the eastern
Pacific into the Northwest U.S. and a separate
northwestward-drifting southern High Plains ridge to consolidate
into a strong ridge anchored over the Great Basin and central
Rockies by next Friday-Saturday. These features should support a
heat wave affecting the Northwest and parts of the Great
Basin/California with temperatures over some areas likely to
approach or reach daily records for highs/warm lows from midweek
onward. Moisture/impulses to the south of the consolidating ridge
may lead to some expansion of monsoon activity. Farther east the
axis of a mean trough consisting of multiple individual shortwaves
should progress eastward from the northern Plains and ultimately
settle over eastern Canada and the northeastern quadrant of the
lower 48. Associated fronts and leading warm/moist flow will
produce areas of rain and thunderstorms mainly over the eastern
half of the country.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The 00Z/06Z models and means generally followed through on the
recently improved agreement for evolution within the mean trough
aloft reaching the eastern half of North America. A leading
northern Plains shortwave should eject into Canada while upstream
energy reinforces the upper trough, resulting in dissipation of
the initial cold front followed by another front that pushes
south/east from the northern tier during the latter half of the
week. From the large scale perspective the primary difference that
arises is toward Friday-Saturday when 00Z/06Z GFS runs shift the
Northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska into western Canada upper pattern
farther eastward than consensus. At least into early Saturday this
does not appear to have much effect on the cold front reaching the
eastern U.S. though. The 12Z GFS has made some favorable
adjustments toward the majority. Also note that the 00Z/12Z CMC
runs stray faster than the consensus with the eastern
shortwave/front by late in the period. Guidance comparisons led to
a starting blend consisting of the 00Z/06Z operational models
early followed by a trend to an even model/mean mix by day 7
Saturday--a little more 00Z ECMWF than 00Z ECens and less 06Z GFS
than 06Z GEFS.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

For the Northwest heat wave, a few locations in Oregon could see
highs reach 10F or more above normal already on Tuesday but
greater coverage of plus 10-20F or so anomalies should prevail
over Washington/Oregon and some surrounding areas from Wednesday
into the weekend.  A decent number of locations may see readings
approach if not reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows
over multiple days. Current forecasts suggest this heat wave will
not be nearly as extreme as the all-time record event in late June
but could still be the second most significant of the summer for
the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Meanwhile shortwaves/moisture tracking around the southern side of
the consolidating upper ridge over the Great Basin/central Rockies
will likely provide a steady increase of coverage and rainfall
amounts in monsoon activity over and near the Four Corners states.
As a result high temperatures over this area may decline a bit
after near or slightly above normal values early in the period.

To the east of the Rockies, a leading Plains into Great Lakes
front (dissipating by Thursday) and a trailing front that reaches
the East Coast and south-central U.S. around the start of next
weekend will provide the best-defined focus for showers and
thunderstorms during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rain will be possible from the Midwest and Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast but it will likely take
into the short-range time frame to resolve the finer details of
magnitude and location of highest totals. Farther ahead of the
fronts, daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the
East and Deep South within a warm and moist environment. A
tropical wave may increase rainfall over southern Florida next
Saturday.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10F or
greater should be for morning lows over and near the Great Lakes
especially Tuesday-Thursday plus the Northeast late in the week,
though a few isolated plus 10F anomalies for highs could be
possible. Even with single-digit anomalies for highs over most
areas, the combined heat and humidity could support heat index
values into the low 100s for many in at least the southern half of
the central/eastern U.S. Highest heat index values are likely over
the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and vicinity along with
areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast. The cold front
reaching the East toward the end of the week will likely bring
high temperatures down to within a few degrees on either side of
normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther east by next
Saturday.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek onward...

...Overview...

Most guidance expects an upper ridge tracking from the eastern
Pacific into the Northwest U.S. and a separate
northwestward-drifting southern High Plains ridge to consolidate
into a strong ridge anchored over the Great Basin and central
Rockies by next Friday-Saturday. These features should support a
heat wave affecting the Northwest and parts of the Great
Basin/California with temperatures over some areas likely to
approach or reach daily records for highs/warm lows from midweek
onward. Moisture/impulses to the south of the consolidating ridge
may lead to some expansion of monsoon activity. Farther east the
axis of a mean trough consisting of multiple individual shortwaves
should progress eastward from the northern Plains and ultimately
settle over eastern Canada and the northeastern quadrant of the
lower 48. Associated fronts and leading warm/moist flow will
produce areas of rain and thunderstorms mainly over the eastern
half of the country.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The 00Z/06Z models and means generally followed through on the
recently improved agreement for evolution within the mean trough
aloft reaching the eastern half of North America. A leading
northern Plains shortwave should eject into Canada while upstream
energy reinforces the upper trough, resulting in dissipation of
the initial cold front followed by another front that pushes
south/east from the northern tier during the latter half of the
week. From the large scale perspective the primary difference that
arises is toward Friday-Saturday when 00Z/06Z GFS runs shift the
Northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska into western Canada upper pattern
farther eastward than consensus. At least into early Saturday this
does not appear to have much effect on the cold front reaching the
eastern U.S. though. The 12Z GFS has made some favorable
adjustments toward the majority. Also note that the 00Z/12Z CMC
runs stray faster than the consensus with the eastern
shortwave/front by late in the period. Guidance comparisons led to
a starting blend consisting of the 00Z/06Z operational models
early followed by a trend to an even model/mean mix by day 7
Saturday--a little more 00Z ECMWF than 00Z ECens and less 06Z GFS
than 06Z GEFS.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

For the Northwest heat wave, a few locations in Oregon could see
highs reach 10F or more above normal already on Tuesday but
greater coverage of plus 10-20F or so anomalies should prevail
over Washington/Oregon and some surrounding areas from Wednesday
into the weekend.  A decent number of locations may see readings
approach if not reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows
over multiple days. Current forecasts suggest this heat wave will
not be nearly as extreme as the all-time record event in late June
but could still be the second most significant of the summer for
the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Meanwhile shortwaves/moisture tracking around the southern side of
the consolidating upper ridge over the Great Basin/central Rockies
will likely provide a steady increase of coverage and rainfall
amounts in monsoon activity over and near the Four Corners states.
As a result high temperatures over this area may decline a bit
after near or slightly above normal values early in the period.

To the east of the Rockies, a leading Plains into Great Lakes
front (dissipating by Thursday) and a trailing front that reaches
the East Coast and south-central U.S. around the start of next
weekend will provide the best-defined focus for showers and
thunderstorms during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rain will be possible from the Midwest and Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast but it will likely take
into the short-range time frame to resolve the finer details of
magnitude and location of highest totals. Farther ahead of the
fronts, daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the
East and Deep South within a warm and moist environment. A
tropical wave may increase rainfall over southern Florida next
Saturday.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10F or
greater should be for morning lows over and near the Great Lakes
especially Tuesday-Thursday plus the Northeast late in the week,
though a few isolated plus 10F anomalies for highs could be
possible. Even with single-digit anomalies for highs over most
areas, the combined heat and humidity could support heat index
values into the low 100s for many in at least the southern half of
the central/eastern U.S. Highest heat index values are likely over
the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and vicinity along with
areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast. The cold front
reaching the East toward the end of the week will likely bring
high temperatures down to within a few degrees on either side of
normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther east by next
Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat August 07 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible from the Central Plains
to the Midwest through Sunday...

...Hot in the Great Plains, with poor air quality due to wildfire
smoke found throughout parts of the High Plains, Rockies, and
Intermountain West...

An upper level disturbance and frontal boundary will be the focus
for potentially severe thunderstorms this evening across the
Central Plains and Midwest. Storms from the TX/OK Panhandles to
the Upper Mississippi Valley could produce damaging wind gusts,
large hail, and tornadoes. The greatest threat of isolated
tornadoes is forecast across parts of southeast Minnesota,
northeast Iowa, and southwest Wisconsin. In addition to the severe
threat, flash flooding is also a concern this afternoon across the
Upper Midwest. By Sunday, as a wave of low pressure inches east
across the Midwest, the next round of potentially severe storms is
expected to set up between southern Wisconsin and eastern Kansas.
Portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley may also contend with
areas of flash flooding on Sunday as well. In total, as much as 2
to 4 inches of rain is possible by the end of the weekend for
portions of the Midwest.

Three other areas expected to receive notable rainfall through
Monday are located throughout the Northwest, Southwest, and
Mid-Atlantic. Starting with the latter, a weakening frontal
boundary with a wave of low pressure tracking northeast along it
will induce heavy showers and thunderstorms from the southeastern
Virginia to the New Jersey coast this evening. Some instances of
flash flooding are possible before the system exits the region
early on Sunday. In the Northwest, a potent Pacific cold front is
responsible for wet and cooler conditions across the Northern
Rockies and Northern High Plains by the beginning of the week.
Isolated severe thunderstorms and up to an inch of rain is
forecast over northwest and north-central Montana by the end of
Sunday. Elsewhere, monsoonal moisture may result in scattered
thunderstorms over the next couple of days across southern
Arizona.

Temperature-wise, above normal temperatures are expected from much
of the central U.S. to the Lower Great Lakes. Parts of the central
and southern High Plains could eclipse the century mark, while
hotter and more humid conditions return to the Northeast by
Monday. Last but certainly not least, thick wildfire smoke
continues to cause poor air quality levels in parts of the
Intermountain West, Rockies, and High Plains. Elevated fire
weather conditions have been issued for the northern High Plains
of Montana this evening and the central Great Basin on Sunday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0231 PM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

The only change to the fire weather outlook for tomorrow (Sunday) is
to introduce an elevated area across portions of eastern Idaho,
southwestern/south-central Montana, and far northwestern Wyoming.
Despite a limited temporal window in the afternoon with
near-critical RH values prior to frontal passage, strong and gusty
winds will elevate the fire weather concerns, especially for areas
with existing fires. See the previous discussion (below) for more
details.

..Jirak.. 08/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Sat Aug 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime with shortwave troughing over the
Pacific northwest will drive a strong cold front through much of the
northern Rockies/ High Plains Sunday. Strong northwesterly flow and
relatively dry surface conditions will support brief elevated fire
weather conditions along and ahead of the front from Montana into
the northern Great Basin.

...Northwestern Great Basin...
Westerly surface winds are expected through much of the day across
the northern Great Basin. On the fringes of high pressure farther
south, mid-level flow should increase ahead of the trough supporting
deep vertical mixing and drying. Widespread surface RH below 15% is
forecast to align with the corridor of enhanced winds supporting
elevated fire weather conditions across much of northern Nevada and
the Great Basin.

Later in the evening, the southern portion of the cold front across
the northern Rockies will begin to pass through the Great Basin and
Intermoutnain west. Winds along and behind the front should increase
substantially, with gusts near 30 mph possible. Surface RH should
rapidly recover behind the front limiting the potential for greater
sustained fire weather conditions. However, the strong and shifting
winds may briefly enhance the fire weather threat early in the
evening.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
Ahead of the cold front moving southeast out of Canada and the
Pacific Northwest, surface winds are forecast to increase markedly
through the day across portions of southern Montana and northern
Wyoming. A dry airmass enhanced by downslope flow on the backside of
a stalled surface trough will support low surface RH near 20%. As
winds increase near the front where surface pressure gradients will
be maximized, west-northwest winds of 20-30 mph and higher gusts are
expected. The overlap of strong winds and dry conditions will
briefly increase the potential for fire weather conditions to
elevated and near critical levels. Uncertainty remains high on the
longevity of any sustained fire weather potential given the rapid
decline in favorable conditions behind the front. However, mostly
dry fuels and the presence of strong shifting winds suggests some
threat is possible. No areas will be delineated at this time given
the expected brief nature of sustained fire weather threats.
However, this will be reassessed in subsequent outlooks.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek onward...

...Overview...

Most of the guidance agrees that upper level ridging will
consolidate from the Northwest U.S. into the Southern Plains
during the extended range period, while upper troughing (and
embedded shortwaves) moves through the Upper Great Lakes and
Northeast. These features should support a heat wave affecting the
Northwest and parts of the Great Basin/California with
temperatures over some areas likely to approach or reach daily
records for highs/warm lows from midweek onward. Across the
eastern third of the country, associated fronts and leading
warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and thunderstorms, some
locally heavy at times.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest cycle of model guidance continues to show above average
agreement regarding both the upper ridge across the West and
South, and mean troughing settling from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast. There remains some typical uncertainties in the details
of individual shortwave impulses embedded within the larger scale
trough, but a general blend of the guidance seems like a good
starting point right now. Elsewhere, there continues to be some
timing differences regarding a shortwave dropping out of the Gulf
of Alaska as well as another shortwave moving towards the West
Coast day 7/Sunday which could act to suppress the Western U.S.
ridge a bit. Given the late period timing, opted to lean on a
50/50 blend of the deterministic models and ensemble means which
gave a reasonable middle ground solution.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

For the Northwest heat wave, daytime high anomalies of plus 10-20F
or so should prevail over Washington/Oregon and surrounding areas
from Wednesday through the weekend. A decent number of locations
across the Northwest and into northern California may see readings
approach if not reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows
over multiple days. Current forecasts suggest this heat wave will
not be nearly as extreme as the all-time record event in late June
but could still be the second most significant of the summer for
the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Meanwhile, shortwaves/moisture tracking around the southern side
of the consolidating upper ridge over the Great Basin/central
Rockies will likely provide a steady increase of coverage and
rainfall amounts in monsoon activity over and near the Four
Corners states. As a result high temperatures over this area may
decline a bit after near or slightly above normal values early in
the period.

To the east of the Rockies, a leading Plains into Great Lakes
front (dissipating by Thursday) and a trailing front that reaches
the East Coast and south-central U.S. around the start of next
weekend will provide the best-defined focus for showers and
thunderstorms during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rain will be possible from the Midwest and Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast but it will likely take
into the short-range time frame to resolve the finer details of
magnitude and location of highest totals. Farther ahead of the
fronts, daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the
East and Deep South within a warm and moist environment. A
tropical wave may also increase rainfall over southern Florida
next Friday into Saturday.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10F or
greater should be for morning lows over and near the Great Lakes
especially Wednesday-Thursday plus the Northeast late in the week,
though a few isolated plus 10F anomalies for highs could be
possible. Even with single-digit anomalies for highs over most
areas, the combined heat and humidity could support heat index
values into the low 100s for many in at least the southern half of
the central/eastern U.S.. Highest heat index values are likely
over the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and vicinity along
with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast. The cold front
reaching the East toward the end of the week will likely bring
high temperatures down to within a few degrees on either side of
normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther east by the
weekend.

...Northwest heat wave likely to bring temperatures that challenge
daily records from midweek onward...

...Overview...

Most of the guidance agrees that upper level ridging will
consolidate from the Northwest U.S. into the Southern Plains
during the extended range period, while upper troughing (and
embedded shortwaves) moves through the Upper Great Lakes and
Northeast. These features should support a heat wave affecting the
Northwest and parts of the Great Basin/California with
temperatures over some areas likely to approach or reach daily
records for highs/warm lows from midweek onward. Across the
eastern third of the country, associated fronts and leading
warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and thunderstorms, some
locally heavy at times.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest cycle of model guidance continues to show above average
agreement regarding both the upper ridge across the West and
South, and mean troughing settling from the Great Lakes to the
Northeast. There remains some typical uncertainties in the details
of individual shortwave impulses embedded within the larger scale
trough, but a general blend of the guidance seems like a good
starting point right now. Elsewhere, there continues to be some
timing differences regarding a shortwave dropping out of the Gulf
of Alaska as well as another shortwave moving towards the West
Coast day 7/Sunday which could act to suppress the Western U.S.
ridge a bit. Given the late period timing, opted to lean on a
50/50 blend of the deterministic models and ensemble means which
gave a reasonable middle ground solution.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

For the Northwest heat wave, daytime high anomalies of plus 10-20F
or so should prevail over Washington/Oregon and surrounding areas
from Wednesday through the weekend. A decent number of locations
across the Northwest and into northern California may see readings
approach if not reach/exceed daily records for highs and warm lows
over multiple days. Current forecasts suggest this heat wave will
not be nearly as extreme as the all-time record event in late June
but could still be the second most significant of the summer for
the Portland-Seattle corridor.

Meanwhile, shortwaves/moisture tracking around the southern side
of the consolidating upper ridge over the Great Basin/central
Rockies will likely provide a steady increase of coverage and
rainfall amounts in monsoon activity over and near the Four
Corners states. As a result high temperatures over this area may
decline a bit after near or slightly above normal values early in
the period.

To the east of the Rockies, a leading Plains into Great Lakes
front (dissipating by Thursday) and a trailing front that reaches
the East Coast and south-central U.S. around the start of next
weekend will provide the best-defined focus for showers and
thunderstorms during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to
heavy rain will be possible from the Midwest and Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast but it will likely take
into the short-range time frame to resolve the finer details of
magnitude and location of highest totals. Farther ahead of the
fronts, daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the
East and Deep South within a warm and moist environment. A
tropical wave may also increase rainfall over southern Florida
next Friday into Saturday.

Very warm to hot conditions should prevail to the east and south
of the two cold fronts. The highest anomalies of plus 10F or
greater should be for morning lows over and near the Great Lakes
especially Wednesday-Thursday plus the Northeast late in the week,
though a few isolated plus 10F anomalies for highs could be
possible. Even with single-digit anomalies for highs over most
areas, the combined heat and humidity could support heat index
values into the low 100s for many in at least the southern half of
the central/eastern U.S.. Highest heat index values are likely
over the lower half of the Mississippi Valley and vicinity along
with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast. The cold front
reaching the East toward the end of the week will likely bring
high temperatures down to within a few degrees on either side of
normal over the central U.S. by Friday and farther east by the
weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0148 AM CDT Sun Aug 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough over the Pacific Northwest will move to
the east through the day as an attendant cold front advances through
the Great Basin and northern Rockies. Ahead of and along the front,
westerly winds are forecast to increase through the day, overlapping
with dry surface conditions. The strong winds and wind shift behind
the front will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies...
Ahead of the cold front across Montana, southwesterly surface winds
will begin to increase as surface pressure gradients and mid-level
flow strengthen through much of the day. The downslope orientation
of surface winds and strong heating should support dry surface
conditions with RH below 25% across much of southern Montana,
western Wyoming and northeastern Idaho. As surface winds approach
25-35 mph near and along the front, a corridor of elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions will likely develop by mid
afternoon. The fire weather threat is expected to be relatively
brief, as surface humidity recovers rapidly behind the front.
However, given the magnitude of the forecast winds and the
significant shift in direction, brief elevated to critical
conditions are expected especially near any active fires.

As the cold front moves eastward through the afternoon, isolated
thunderstorms may develop across Idaho and Montana. Model soundings
show weak buoyancy atop a mostly dry boundary layer suggesting the
potential for a few dry lightning strikes. While coverage is not
anticipated to reach dry thunder criteria, a few starts are possible
in dry fuels. Strong downdraft winds associated with high-based
storms may also contribute to stronger winds gusts ahead of the
frontal passage.

...Northern Great Basin...
Along southern portions of the aforementioned cold front, surface
winds will gradually increase through the day across portions of the
Great Basin and northern Nevada. Widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected, with warm and dry conditions across much of the region. As
the front approaches by mid to late afternoon, surface winds are
forecast to reach 15-20 mph with higher gusts. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions are forecast to  develop before the
front brings cooler and more stable conditions into the evening and
overnight.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough is forecast to move eastward across Montana and
Wyoming reaching the western Dakotas by early evening. At the
surface, a cold front associated with the trough will continue to
move east leaving a cooler and drier airmass across the Rockies and
central High Plains. Breezy westerly winds in the Rockies may
support locally elevated fire weather conditions across portions of
Wyoming.

...Southern Wyoming...
Within the post frontal airmass over the central Rockies, westerly
surface winds will remain gusty through much of the day as west to
east surface pressure gradients slowly weaken. Dry northwesterly
flow at the surface should keep humidity values low around 20%.
Winds of 15-20 mph may support locally elevated fire weather
conditions within the Red Desert and southern Wyoming before flow
weaken substantially late in the afternoon and early evening.
Elevated highlights will be withheld for now as the greatest overlap
of strong winds and low humidity appears to be over areas with
little concentration of favorable fuels.

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible in the Midwest and Great
Lakes, severe weather returns to the Northern Plains on Monday...

...Hot in the Great Plains; poor air quality due to wildfire smoke
throughout parts of the West...

The Midwest and Northern Plains are set to see some of the most
active weather to close out the weekend and to start the
work-week. Today, a frontal system over the North Central U.S.
will be the catalyst for additional severe thunderstorms capable
of producing damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes in the mid
and upper Mississippi Valleys. Some of these storms will also
contain excessive rainfall rates, promoting a threat for flash
flooding as well. Slight Risks for both severe weather and
Excessive Rainfall have been issued for portions of the Midwest
today as a result. The threat for severe weather and heavy rain
moves a little further east towards the Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley as a warm front lifts north through these regions on
Monday. Meanwhile, a cold front pushing across the northern
Rockies and Plains looks to trigger strong-to-severe storms in
these areas later today. The cold front heads for the Dakotas on
Monday where a renewed threat for severe weather is anticipated in
the northern and central Plains.

Abnormally hot conditions will be common throughout the Plains on
Sunday with high temperatures approaching the century mark from
West Texas on north into the Dakotas. Monday becomes even more hot
in the Heartland with some locations in the central Plains
potentially breaking daily record high temps. Hotter and
increasingly humid conditions will also engulf most areas east of
the Mississippi by Monday. A nearby area of low pressure may help
to keep temperatures on the cooler side along the Northeast coast
thanks to lingering showers and cloud cover. Speaking of cooler
temperatures, the cold front swinging through the Northwest will
provide an injection of cooler Pacific air to the interior Pacific
Northwest on Sunday, followed by the northern Rockies and High
Plains on Monday. Meanwhile, thick wildfire smoke continues to
plague parts of California, the Intermountain West, and High
Plains with terrible air quality. Expect Air Quality Alerts to
remain in effect for portions of the West into the start of the
upcoming week. Elevated fire weather conditions have been issued
for northern Nevada, the northern Rockies and northern High Plains.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1054 AM CST Tue Feb 08 2022

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...

The primary changes with this update were to connect the two
Elevated areas and slightly expand the Critical area in the central
Plains. Latest mesoanalysis depicts a surface cold front extending
from northeastern NM northeastward across parts of south-central KS.
The front slopes northward with height into north-central NE, with
the strongest low-level cold air advection now overspreading
southern NE. Here, visible satellite imagery and surface
observations depict a scattered to broken altostratus cloud deck
advancing southeastward, and these clouds should generally continue
eroding from north to south with daytime heating and strengthening
downslope flow off the Rockies. As the cold advection regime
continues to move southward and weaken with time, RAP forecast
soundings depict deep boundary-layer mixing extending into the
2-4-km layer, where 12Z soundings show 40-50 mph winds across the
post-frontal airmass. Therefore, these winds will likely mix down to
the surface during the afternoon hours today, where RH reductions
into the upper teens to lower/middle 20s (based on modified 12Z
soundings) overlap very dry fuels (ERCs in the 80th-95th
percentile).

Farther south across the TX/OK Panhandles and TX South Plains, clear
skies ahead of the approaching cold front should also favor a deeply
mixed boundary layer and minimum afternoon RH in the lower/middle
teens. Sustained west-southwesterly surface winds near 15-20 mph are
expected to coincide with the critically low RH, though the lack of
a stronger pressure gradient and modest lower tropospheric flow
should mitigate a higher-end fire-weather threat. With that said,
spotty and brief critical conditions cannot be ruled out. A rapid
wind shift to the north behind the previously mentioned boundary
could potentially re-direct any fires across the area by the late
afternoon/early evening timeframe.

..Weinman.. 02/08/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CST Tue Feb 08 2022/

...Synopsis...
A progressive mid-level trough will move southeast across the
central Plains today, accompanied by 60+ kt 500 mb flow which will
overspread a dry, well-mixed boundary layer this afternoon. Broad
surface lee-troughing across the central Plains will foster dry
westerly surface winds extending from southern South Dakota into
western Texas, where wildfire-spread concerns exist.

...Central Plains...
As the upper trough overspreads the region during the afternoon,
widespread 25+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds will
coincide with 20-25 percent RH for at least a couple hours during
the afternoon. Fuels remain quite dry across the area, with Critical
highlights introduced mainly due to the combination of very dry
fuels and strong winds.

...Western Texas...
Downslope flow and surface lee troughing will encourage 15 mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds by afternoon peak heating,
when RH is also expected to drop to 15 percent. Given the presence
of at least modestly dry fuels, Elevated highlights have been
introduced.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
159 PM EST Tue Feb 08 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Feb 11 2022 - 12Z Tue Feb 15 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance continues to advertise persistence of an amplified East
Pacific/West Coast upper ridge and downstream mean trough through
the weekend, followed by a significant pattern change early next
week as a trough initially tracking across the North Pacific drops
into the West ahead of a newly building Pacific upper ridge.  This
evolution will ultimately lead to a flatter trend for downstream
flow, with the initial western ridge migrating through the
western/central U.S. and the eastern trough departing from the
East Coast by next Tuesday.  The forecast pattern will tend to
favor below-average coverage and intensity of precipitation over
the lower 48.  Parts of the West will see well above normal
temperatures late this week into the weekend before a cooling
trend while some areas farther to the east may see some notable
temperature swings over the course of the period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles agree on the large scale pattern evolution
but embedded detail uncertainties persist.  These issues involve
specifics of initial upper trough energy crossing the eastern half
of the country/eventual western Atlantic surface development,
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough/associated surface
pattern, and distribution/timing of North Pacific shortwave energy
expected to push into the West next week.  Thus far the consensus
indicates that the eastern trough aloft will remain sufficiently
open to keep a potential western Atlantic system far enough
offshore not to bring meaningful precipitation to the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast around Sunday-Monday.  However a minority of
ensemble members could still suggest a lingering low-end potential
for moisture to extend farther westward.  Meanwhile models have
been varying considerably for specifics of the surface pattern
over the central/eastern U.S. behind this system.  At least the
06Z GFS/GEFS and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs arrived at similar
ideas for the next wave so their scenario provides the most likely
option at this time.  Operational model runs have also been
erratic with the details of Pacific energy coming into the West.
Again the aforementioned models/means showed reasonable agreement
in principle, bringing an open shortwave into the West, while
individual stray runs such as the 00Z CMC pulled off a low
offshore.  The 00Z ECMWF could be a little too amplified though.
The new 12Z CMC has adjusted to the model/mean consensus and the
12Z ECMWF has toned down its trough amplitude.

Based on the guidance comparisons through 06Z data, an operational
model blend with greater emphasis on the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF
transitioned to a model/mean mix among the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means.  Maintaining continuity, QPF stayed closer to
the operational model scenario near the East Coat around
Sunday-Monday.  PoPs represented a compromise between the wetter
ensemble means and fairly dry operational guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong but progressive clipper type low pressure system will
cross the northern Great Lakes on Friday and then track into
northern New England/eastern Canada by Saturday, spreading snow
across the Great Lakes and mostly light rain farther south and
east.  Expect breezy to windy conditions across the Upper Midwest
and Great Lakes region as this low moves through the region.
Parts of the Plains/Rockies could also see a brief period of brisk
winds as a couple cold fronts push southward.  Trailing Canadian
surface high pressure dropping southward across the central U.S.
will deliver dry conditions to much of the nation for the upcoming
weekend.  It appears likely that low pressure will develop off the
East Coast Sunday-Monday but the system is likely to be far enough
offshore to keep most of the precipitation and wind away from
land.  The upper trough and leading front reaching the West early
next week should bring an area of precipitation (mostly light to
moderate) and possibly strengthening winds to the region.
Coverage and timing of rain and mountain snow will depend on
system details that remain somewhat uncertain.

A majority of the West will see above normal temperatures from
late this week through the weekend.  Expect the warmest anomalies
(plus 10-15F and locally higher) to be centered over and near
California where high temperatures may challenge or exceed daily
record values.  Then the upper trough/leading cold front moving
into the West early next week will bring a cooling trend,
ultimately leading to highs within a few degrees F on either side
of normal by next Tuesday.  Farther to the east, the Plains should
see plus 10-20F anomalies for max and/or min temperatures on
Friday.  Frontal passage will bring a brief cooler period during
the weekend followed by temperatures rebounding to 5-20F above
normal early next week.  The eastern U.S. will see its warmest
temperatures of the period Friday-Saturday ahead of the
approaching front.  Plus 5-15F anomalies will be common and parts
of the Northeast could see lows 20F or more above normal on one or
both days.  The cold surge behind the front will reach the
Mississippi Valley by Saturday and then continue toward the East
Coast, leading to one or more days of max/min readings of 10-20F
below normal with coldest anomalies tending to focus over the
northern half of the East.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 08 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement in the dynamical models favoring the
development of mid-level low pressure over the southwestern CONUS to induce
surface low formation over the Great Plains early in the period. This
predicted
surface feature has the potential for triggering heavy precipitation across
portions of the Southern Plains, Mississippi, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and
the Southeast, as well as heavy snow across the higher elevations of the
Rockies and over portions of the Central Plains and Midwest. Over Alaska, the
prevailing mid-level height pattern supports the potential for below-normal
temperatures across the western and northern Mainland with possible heavy
precipitation and high elevation snow across the Southeast and the Panhandle
early in week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Central and Southern Rockies, the Central
and
Southern High Plains, and portions of the Mississippi Valley, Wed-Fri, Feb
16-18.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Alaska Panhandle, Wed-Fri, Feb 16-18.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation over portions of the Southern Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and the Southeast, Wed-Fri, Feb 16-18.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Alaska Panhandle, Wed-Fri, Feb
16-18.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the southwestern and south-central

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 11 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pnG2RzKOUPlIrk9Rc1CIv8zBEokzvJDjO2wSSe07mXV8rB3pvPqXHbPNYaFf3e8TvmGGU6kh$

FOR WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 16 - TUESDAY FEBRUARY 22: By the start of the period,
this morning's 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian 500-hPa height forecasts continue
to feature highly amplified ridging over the northeastern Pacific, with the
development of downstream troughing over the southwestern CONUS. Similar to
previous ensemble runs, the ECMWF remains more pronounced with this shortwave
disturbance compared to the GEFS, favoring a deeper trough axis extending into
northern Mexico and a larger distribution of negative height departures over
the higher elevations of the West and Great Plains early in the period.
Despite
these differences in strength, surface low formation remains favored over the
High Plains associated with this mid-level feature, which looks to be the
focal
point for potentially heavy precipitation and snowfall in today's outlook over
the CONUS. Towards the middle of the period, the ensemble mean solutions begin
to diverge on the evolution of the mid-level pattern leading to uncertainty in
the outlook later in February.  The GEFS remains bullish on the return of full
latitude troughing over eastern North America, whereas the ECMWF and Canadian
favor more anomalous ridging extending from the western Atlantic into the
eastern U.S., resulting in conflicting perspectives in regards to anomalous
temperatures over the eastern CONUS through the end of the period.



There is good agreement in the ensembles featuring surface low formation over
the High Plains with surface high pressure situated over the eastern CONUS to
promote return flow and the advection of Gulf moisture into the Great Plains
and Mississippi Valley early in the period.  Although the GEFS remains
comparably weaker to the ECMWF in terms of the spatial extent and magnitude of
total precipitation, both reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
3-day precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch,
supporting the continuation of a slight risk of heavy precipitation from Feb
16
to 18 over the Southern Plains, Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and
the
Southeast.  While the highest precipitation amounts are favored in the warm
sector of the predicted surface low, higher probabilities (>40%) for 3-day
totals exceeding the 85th percentile are indicated in the ECMWF reforecast
tool
across the Southern and Central Rockies and the Central Plains. Here, cold air
advection is likely on the backside of the low as supported by strengthening
negative 850-hPa temperature departures depicted in the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles in the region. Thus, a slight risk of heavy snow remains issued from
Feb 16 to 18 and is expanded eastward into the Middle Mississippi Valley
relative to yesterday's outlook. Heavy snowfall is possible across other
portions of the Midwest and Great Lakes as the low tracks eastward with time,
however there is still a good deal of uncertainty as to the details on timing,
location, and strength of the potential storm track later in the period.



Additionally, the deep trough axis favored aloft is expected to be conducive
for elevated winds across the southwestern and south-central CONUS. This
continues to be evidenced by strong surface pressure gradients in the
deterministic and ensemble guidance early in the period, and a slight risk of
high winds is issued from the Four Corners region to the Mississippi Valley.
The potential for high winds over parts of the Southwest and Great Basin
increases the risk of wildfires and dust storms given low soil moisture
content
and the widespread severe to extreme drought conditions currently registered
in
the region.



Over Alaska, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to feature 500-hPa
troughing over the Chukchi Sea early in the period which is expected to
promote
the advection of arctic air into many parts of the western and northern
Mainland. Although the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts a warmer scenario
compared
to yesterday, the GEFS reforecast tool depicts stronger chances for minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile with increased chances for
temperatures reaching hazard thresholds over the Northern Slope. Thus, a
slight
risk of much below normal temperatures remains issued early in the period, and
is expanded northward in the updated outlook.



Across the southern Mainland and Panhandle, increased onshore flow is expected
to promote above-normal precipitation over the region. Compared to yesterday,
higher total precipitation amounts are favored in the uncalibrated guidance
early in the period and the GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20%
chance of 3-day totals exceeding the 85th percentile and two inches to support
the addition of a slight risk of heavy precipitation. The favored increase in
moisture also increases the potential for locally heavy snowfall over the
higher elevations, prompting a corresponding hazard covering the southeastern
Mainland through the Panhandle for Feb 16 to 18.  Due to antecedent wet
conditions in southeastern Alaska, where several locations have experienced
near or more than twice of their normal precipitation accumulation for the
year, the continuation of above-normal precipitation during week-2 is expected
to adversely affect the highlighted region and raises the concern for
landslides in the low elevations.

milder than normal conditions for early February persists.  Fire
danger is forecast to be at critical levels over good portion of
the central Plains through tonight due to gusty downslope winds
and dry conditions.  By Wednesday, the focus of warm weather will
shift to the immediate coastal areas of California where high

parts of southern California.  In advance of this anomalous
February heat, an Excessive Heat Watch that includes the Los
Angeles metro area has been issued from late Wednesday into
Friday. The West Coast is not the only region expected to see
temperatures resembling more like spring rather than winter.  Even
much of the eastern U.S. will witness high temperatures reaching
into the 50s and 60s over the Mid-Atlantic, which are levels
normally seen in March.

Precipitation-wise, snow associated with a quick-hitting coastal
storm that has already resulted in more than a foot of snow inland
is expected to taper off by Wednesday morning as the storm moves
further into the Canadian Maritimes.  Farther south, the Sunshine
State will see more widespread showers and plenty of clouds
through tonight.  Drier conditions and sunshine are forecast to
progress from north to south across the state on Wednesday.
Elsewhere, a wave of low pressure is set to track through southern
Canada today and end up in the upper Great Lakes by Wednesday.
Periods of snow are likely in northern Minnesota and Wisconsin
tonight.  By Wednesday, rain and snow showers will envelope much
of the Great Lakes with the heaviest snowfall accumulations
confined to areas along the northern coast of Michigan's Upper
Peninsula where there will be a little more lake enhancement.
Some rain and snow showers may make their way into the northern
Mid-Atlantic and interior Northeast Wednesday night.  Lastly, an
upper level disturbance diving south through the northern High
Plains on Wednesday will produce periods of snow in the Black
Hills and central Rockies.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Guidance continues to advertise persistence of an amplified East
Pacific/West Coast upper ridge and downstream mean trough through
the weekend, followed by a significant pattern change early next
week as a trough initially tracking across the North Pacific drops
into the West ahead of a newly building Pacific upper ridge.  This
evolution will ultimately lead to a flatter trend for downstream
flow, with the initial western ridge migrating through the
western/central U.S. and the eastern trough departing from the
East Coast by next Tuesday.  The forecast pattern will tend to
favor below-average coverage and intensity of precipitation over
the lower 48.  Parts of the West will see well above normal
temperatures late this week into the weekend before a cooling
trend while some areas farther to the east may see some notable
temperature swings over the course of the period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles agree on the large scale pattern evolution
but embedded detail uncertainties persist.  These issues involve
specifics of initial upper trough energy crossing the eastern half
of the country/eventual western Atlantic surface development,
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough/associated surface
pattern, and distribution/timing of North Pacific shortwave energy
expected to push into the West next week.  Thus far the consensus
indicates that the eastern trough aloft will remain sufficiently
open to keep a potential western Atlantic system far enough
offshore not to bring meaningful precipitation to the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast around Sunday-Monday.  However a minority of
ensemble members could still suggest a lingering low-end potential
for moisture to extend farther westward.  Meanwhile models have
been varying considerably for specifics of the surface pattern
over the central/eastern U.S. behind this system.  At least the
06Z GFS/GEFS and 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs arrived at similar
ideas for the next wave so their scenario provides the most likely
option at this time.  Operational model runs have also been
erratic with the details of Pacific energy coming into the West.
Again the aforementioned models/means showed reasonable agreement
in principle, bringing an open shortwave into the West, while
individual stray runs such as the 00Z CMC pulled off a low
offshore.  The 00Z ECMWF could be a little too amplified though.
The new 12Z CMC has adjusted to the model/mean consensus and the
12Z ECMWF has toned down its trough amplitude.

Based on the guidance comparisons through 06Z data, an operational
model blend with greater emphasis on the 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF
transitioned to a model/mean mix among the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means.  Maintaining continuity, QPF stayed closer to
the operational model scenario near the East Coat around
Sunday-Monday.  PoPs represented a compromise between the wetter
ensemble means and fairly dry operational guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong but progressive clipper type low pressure system will
cross the northern Great Lakes on Friday and then track into
northern New England/eastern Canada by Saturday, spreading snow
across the Great Lakes and mostly light rain farther south and
east.  Expect breezy to windy conditions across the Upper Midwest
and Great Lakes region as this low moves through the region.
Parts of the Plains/Rockies could also see a brief period of brisk
winds as a couple cold fronts push southward.  Trailing Canadian
surface high pressure dropping southward across the central U.S.
will deliver dry conditions to much of the nation for the upcoming
weekend.  It appears likely that low pressure will develop off the
East Coast Sunday-Monday but the system is likely to be far enough
offshore to keep most of the precipitation and wind away from
land.  The upper trough and leading front reaching the West early
next week should bring an area of precipitation (mostly light to
moderate) and possibly strengthening winds to the region.
Coverage and timing of rain and mountain snow will depend on
system details that remain somewhat uncertain.

A majority of the West will see above normal temperatures from
late this week through the weekend.  Expect the warmest anomalies
(plus 10-15F and locally higher) to be centered over and near
California where high temperatures may challenge or exceed daily
record values.  Then the upper trough/leading cold front moving
into the West early next week will bring a cooling trend,
ultimately leading to highs within a few degrees F on either side
of normal by next Tuesday.  Farther to the east, the Plains should
see plus 10-20F anomalies for max and/or min temperatures on
Friday.  Frontal passage will bring a brief cooler period during
the weekend followed by temperatures rebounding to 5-20F above
normal early next week.  The eastern U.S. will see its warmest
temperatures of the period Friday-Saturday ahead of the
approaching front.  Plus 5-15F anomalies will be common and parts
of the Northeast could see lows 20F or more above normal on one or
both days.  The cold surge behind the front will reach the
Mississippi Valley by Saturday and then continue toward the East
Coast, leading to one or more days of max/min readings of 10-20F
below normal with coldest anomalies tending to focus over the
northern half of the East.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly mid-level flow will persist across the central
U.S. as one embedded 500 mb trough ejects into the Atlantic and a
second trough approaches from the northern Rockies/Plains
tomorrow/Thursday. Given the northward displacement of the upper
trough and accompanying surface cold front in the north-central
U.S., a relative lull in the more substantial wildfire-spread
potential is likely across the central Plains into the southern High
Plains, with modestly dry conditions but overall weaker surface flow
expected.

Surface high pressure will also remain in place across the Interior
West, with Elevated to Critically dry and breezy surface conditions
persisting across southern California. However, marginally receptive
fuels should limit widespread significant wildfire-spread potential.

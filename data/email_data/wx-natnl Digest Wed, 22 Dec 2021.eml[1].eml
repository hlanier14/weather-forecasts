Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CST Tue Dec 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

The primary change to the Outlook was to connect the two Elevated
Areas along and west of the I-25 corridor in CO. Here, a few hours
of elevated to locally critical conditions are expected atop
exceptionally dry fuels (widespread ERCs above the 95th percentile).
The spotty coverage of critical conditions precludes a Critical
Area. For additional details, please see the previous discussion
below.

..Weinman.. 12/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Tue Dec 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level shortwave trough will move through the
northwesterly flow across the northern Plains today. As this trough
crosses the Rocky Mountains, lee cyclogenesis is anticipated with a
surface cyclone moving south along the Front Range through the day.
In addition, this passing trough will lead to some strong downslope
flow in the lee of the mountains.

...Southeast Wyoming, far northern Colorado, and portions of the
Nebraska Panhandle...
Strong sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected during the
afternoon across a small portion of the central High Plains as a
result of strengthening downslope flow. Temperatures will be cool in
the region and minimum relative humidity is only expected to drop to
20 to 25 percent for a few hours. In addition, fuels in this region
are dry, but drier fuels are mostly south of this region. Therefore,
an elevated delineation is justified, but marginal temperatures,
relative humidity, and fuels preclude a critical area.

...Eastern New Mexico into far West Texas...
As the lee cyclone moves south along the Front Range, the pressure
gradient will tighten across the southern High Plains. This will
lead to wind speeds increasing to 15 to 20 mph in a very dry airmass
with relative humidity mostly in the single digits.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 PM CST Tue Dec 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR SOUTHEASTERN WYOMING INTO THE
SOUTHWESTERN NEBRASKA PANHANDLE...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update. Of note, locally enhanced fire-weather conditions
will be possible primarily across terrain-favored areas along and
west of the I-25 corridor in CO during the afternoon hours. This
will especially be the case for areas such as Canon City and
Walsenburg, where localized gap flows will support enhanced westerly
surface winds. These conditions appear too localized to warrant
highlights at this time. For additional details on the central High
Plains fire-weather threat, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 12/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Tue Dec 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will cross the central Rockies on Wednesday,
leading to moderately strong lee cyclogenesis. As the surface
pressure gradient tightens, gusty winds are expected across portions
of the southern and central High Plains.

...Southeast Wyoming, far northern Colorado, and far southwest
Nebraska...
As the surface low strengthens and moves into the central Plains,
strong downslope flow is expected to develop in its wake across
southeast Wyoming and into the Nebraska Panhandle and far northern
Colorado. Wind speeds of 25 to 30 mph are anticipated with relative
humidity around 8 to 12 percent.

...Eastern New Mexico into far West Texas...
Westerly winds are expected to strengthen to around 15 to 20 mph
during the afternoon hours with relative humidity around 8 to 12
percent. Some stronger winds may occur late in the afternoon,
especially in western portions of the elevated area as mid-level
flow strengthens between 21 and 00Z.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An impressively strong and persistent ridge over the East-Central
North Pacific and into Alaska will maintain amplified troughing
along or a little inland from the West Coast and a deep cyclonic
gyre over Canada's NW Territories Thursday through this weekend
and possibly well into or through next week. This troughing and
deep low will support an extended period of precipitation and
mostly below normal high temperatures over a broad portion of The
West. The trough's shape will vary from day to day depending on
individual shortwaves digging into the trough with good confidence
on a potent reinforcing shortwave trough pushing down the coast
Friday night before swinging inland into CA Saturday with the next
notable wave likely Tuesday/Tuesday night. Shortwave troughs and
impulses ejecting east from the trough will periodically track
east across the Rockies and the northern tier of the CONUS.
Associated fronts will separate a pronounced temperature contrast,
between well above normal readings over and east of the southern
two-thirds of the Plains and much below normal temperatures
becoming established over the far northern Plains.

The primary forecast problems involve the specifics of individual
shortwaves within the western trough and then their track and
intensity over the northeastern U.S. with a conflict of large
scale pattern teleconnections -- the Pacific/western U.S. pattern
favors above normal upper heights over the East while the
ridging/positive height anomalies northeast of Hudson Bay favoring
moderately below normal eastern U.S. heights. Overall the 00Z CMC
is notably different than the GFS/ECM/UKMET (namely with a more
southern Canadian cold core low/gyre), so it was not included in
the model blend.

Uncertainty still is noted with timing and strength of two waves
shifting east across the Great Lakes Friday night and Saturday
night. The 06Z GFS was much more potent with the second wave than
any other 00Z guidance and the 12Z GFS has backed off to a more
open and thus faster solution (where the feature quickly shifts
offshore over the Mid-Atlantic Saturday night) which is in better
agreement with the latest consensus.

The amplifying trough off the West Coast Friday night rounds a
lobe of low pressure that anchors over the Salish Sea Friday
through Sunday per the latest non-CMC guidance consensus. This
trough then swings east across The West and then support one or
more surface lows/fronts from the Plains eastward Sunday onward.
However, the details in this trough development/progression in
deterministic guidance is different enough to warrant some
inclusion of 06Z GEFS and 00Z ECENS means even for Day 3. By
Monday-Tuesday individual model runs and ensemble members
increasingly diverge for details at the surface and aloft east of
the Rockies, perhaps reflecting the competing teleconnection
tendencies over the East. These differences, as well as decreasing
confidence for details within the western trough late in the
period, favor trending the initial 00Z/06Z operational/ensemble
model blend used through Day 5 to lean more toward the ECENS and
GEFS means for Days 6/7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave troughs/energy rounding a persistent upper trough
aligned near the West Coast will periodically enhance the flow of
moisture into the West, with areas of focused/terrain-enhanced
precipitation extending from the coast into the Rockies. Expect
episodes of moderate to heavy precipitation from the Cascades and
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest into California, which will
increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to local runoff. The
highest precipitation/liquid equivalents should extend from the
Oregon Cascades into northwest California and the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful precipitation will also be likely across the highest
terrain of the Great Basin and the central/northern Rockies.
Colder air filtering into the Pacific Northwest will bring snow
levels to sea level by Saturday night while other parts of the
West will also see declining snow levels as the upper trough axis
nudges eastward.

It is looking likely that two areas of precipitation in the
northeastern quadrant of the CONUS will accompany a pair of
shortwave troughs Saturday/Sunday with the first pushing off New
England Saturday/Christmas morning and the next crossing from the
central Plains Saturday morning and the northern Mid-Atlantic
Saturday night. Wintry weather is likely on the north side of both
these waves from the Upper Great Lakes through New England. The
next wave looks to take a more northern route, tracking from the
central Plains to the Lake Superior and into Canada Sunday/Monday.


The southern half of the Great Plains will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies during the period with decent
coverage of max/min readings 20-30F above normal.  Such
temperatures look to challenge daily high max records across much
of Texas Saturday through Monday and maybe Tuesday. This warmth
will expand east with the northern extent determined by
system/frontal progression over the northern tier. Anomalies
should become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next
Tuesday as the mean troughing continues to broaden and shift
eastward toward the Rockies. Meanwhile temperatures of 20 to 40F
below normal will push across MT/ND this weekend, expanding to
SD/MN by Monday with closer to normal winter temperatures reaching
the central Plains and Upper Great Lakes by Tuesday.

...Low pressure system will spread snow across the Great Lakes
tonight and then a quick round of heavy snow for Maine later on
Wednesday...

...Unsettled weather spreads farther south from the Pacific
Northwest into California as well as farther inland across the
Northern Rockies...

...Critical Fire Weather for parts of the Front Range on
Wednesday...

A low pressure system will travel up and away from the Southeast
coast tonight. This system will generate rain showers and isolated
thunderstorms for parts of the East Coast tonight before moving
off into the Atlantic tomorrow. Another system, currently tracking
across the Upper Midwest, will go on to produce light snow showers
across the Great Lakes tonight into Wednesday. As this system
intensifies tomorrow, snow rates will pick up across parts of
western and northern Maine, leading to the accumulation of 6-10
inches of snow by Wednesday evening. Some light freezing rain may
mix in over parts of interior New England.

Ongoing troughing in the West will contribute to a heavy mountain
snowfall threat and moderate coastal/low elevation rainfall over
the next few days. Over the Cascades and Sierra, between 2-4 feet
of snow are likely with isolated areas likely to receive more.
Much of the Northern Rockies will get between 1-2 feet through
Thursday. Parts of southeastern Washington may pickup some light
freezing rain as well. Snow and rain will shift south across much
of California on Wednesday and especially Thursday, when the
heaviest snow is expected to fall over the Sierra. Many areas
along the West Coast will accumulate 2 or more inches of rainfall
by Thursday night. Critical Fire Risk is in effect for parts of
southeastern Wyoming and northwestern Nebraska tomorrow, as winds
pick up due to the arrival of a surface low pressure system and
humidity remains low. Temperatures will steadily rise above
average across the Great Plains over the next few days as a dome
of high pressure moves into the region.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 27 - 31 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the northern Pacific is forecast, leading to deep
troughing
downstream across the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights
extending
eastward to the Northeast. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to the south
across the Southern Plains and the southeastern CONUS in association with
above
normal 500-hPa heights.

Above normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased chances of above normal
temperatures across most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, while below
normal temperatures are favored over southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle related to the downstream troughing. Troughing over the western a=

north-central CONUS favors below normal temperatures from the western CONUS=
 to
the Northern Plains. Conversely, ridging over the south-central and eastern
CONUS leads to increased chances of above normal temperatures from parts of
the
Southern Rockies and Southern Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.

Above normal precipitation is likely for much of Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians related to  mean surface westerly flow predicted over the Bering
Sea.
Mean offshore flow leads to increased chances of below normal precipitation
across the Alaska Panhandle. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increa=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

FOR WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 29 - TUESDAY JANUARY 04: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensemble means are in good agreement depicting an amplified,
positively tilted mid-level trough continuing from week-1 into the beginnin=
g
of
week-2 over the western CONUS, and gradually weakening throughout the perio=
d.
This pattern supports increased chances for anomalous cold across the weste=
rn
third and north-central CONUS during the period. There is good agreement am=
ong
the reforecast tools indicating an increased risk of much below normal
temperatures across much of the West. A broad area of slight risk (>20%
chance)
of much below normal minimum temperatures is highlighted across parts of th=
e
western half of the CONUS throughout the period, where the reforecast tools
depict at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile. Many of these areas are anticipated to fall to below 20 deg F,
with
the interior West dropping below 0 deg F, and the north-central tier fallin=
g
to
below -20 deg F. An embedded moderate risk (>40% chance) is posted for the
entirety of week-2, and a high risk (>60% chance) is posted for Dec 29-30,
over
parts of the northwestern and north-central CONUS, supported by the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF reforecast tools. Relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs o=
utlook, the duration of the
moderate risk of much below normal minimum temperatures was increased, as t=
he
reforecast tools agree well with at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatu=
res
falling below the 15th percentile for many locations for the duration of th=
e
week-2 period. The reforecast tools indicate increased chances for some are=
as
having at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest
first percentile, particularly across Washington, northern Idaho, and north=
ern
Montana. This is suggestive of near record cold temperatures at the beginni=
ng
of the period over these areas. It should be noted that the cold signals in
the
GEFS reforecast guidance are not as prevalent as in the ECMWF reforecast.
Additionally, the ECMWF indicates an increased potential for some of this
colder air to reach parts of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Vall=
ey
during the middle to latter half of the period, as the mid-level ridge over
the
eastern U.S. is expected to de-amplify.



Mid-level troughing across the West is predicted to continue to support
enhanced moisture over portions of the western half of the CONUS. The GEFS
ensemble mean indicates enhanced integrated vapor transport values exceedin=
g
250 kg/ms primarily focused south of Mexico throughout much of the period,
with
the ECMWF ensemble lacking a signal across these same areas. Despite these
differences, there is still good model agreement regarding the increased
potential for enhanced precipitation across the West. The slight risk of he=
avy
precipitation across parts of Oregon and California is removed in today=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
outlook, as the precipitation signals appear to be more orographically-
induced.
As such, the slight risk of heavy snow for higher elevations of the Klamath
River Basin, Sierra Nevada, and Cascades is maintained for Dec 29-30.
Conversely, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted across parts of =
the
Southwest for Dec 29-31, associated with possible surface low formation off
the
coast of Mexico enhancing the moisture feed. This increased moisture transp=
ort
also supports a slight risk of localized heavy snow across higher elevation
areas of the eastern Great Basin, Four Corners region, and the Front Range =
of
the Rockies, Dec 29-31. A broad area is highlighted where the reforecast to=
ols
indicate some areas exceeding 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the
85th
percentile and half an inch. Heavy snow could increase the potential for
travel
hazards, especially given the increased travel following the holidays. In t=
he
eastern U.S., frontal activity along the western periphery of surface high
pressure over the Southeast may bring enhanced precipitation to portions of
the
Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is identified for these areas, Dec 30-Jan 1, where the
reforecast
tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85t=
h
percentile and one inch.



At the base and ahead of the mid-level trough across the West, surface low
formation supports a slight risk of high winds, Dec 29-Jan 1, from the Grea=
t
Basin eastward to the Central and Southern High Plains. The GEFS reforecast
tool indicates at least a 20% chance of this area experiencing wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile, with the ECMWF reforecast tool indicating a
stronger signal (>40% chance of exceeding the 85th percentile for some
locations). The highest wind speeds (>25 mph) are expected over the Central
and
Southern High Plains.



Over Alaska, mid-level troughing is forecast over the Alaska Panhandle from
the
beginning to middle of the period. Surface high pressure over northwestern
Canada is likely to increase chances for much below normal temperatures for
parts of week-2. A slight risk of much below normal minimum temperatures is
highlighted for the Alaska Panhandle, Dec 29-Jan 1, while a moderate risk i=
s
posted for the Panhandle, Dec 29, where the reforecast tools indicate
increased
probabilities of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile.



A surface low over the Bering Sea at the beginning of the period may suppor=
t
high winds across coastal portions of western Mainland Alaska. A slight ris=
k
of
high winds is posted for this region, Dec 29-31, where there is good agreem=
ent
among the reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.

Valid 12Z Fri Dec 24 2021 - 12Z Tue Dec 28 2021

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An impressively strong and persistent ridge over the East-Central
North Pacific and into Alaska will maintain amplified troughing
along or a little inland from the West Coast and a deep cyclonic
gyre over Canada's NW Territories Thursday through this weekend
and possibly well into or through next week. This troughing and
deep low will support an extended period of precipitation and
mostly below normal high temperatures over a broad portion of The
West. The trough's shape will vary from day to day depending on
individual shortwaves digging into the trough with good confidence
on a potent reinforcing shortwave trough pushing down the coast
Friday night before swinging inland into CA Saturday with the next
notable wave likely Tuesday/Tuesday night. Shortwave troughs and
impulses ejecting east from the trough will periodically track
east across the Rockies and the northern tier of the CONUS.
Associated fronts will separate a pronounced temperature contrast,
between well above normal readings over and east of the southern
two-thirds of the Plains and much below normal temperatures
becoming established over the far northern Plains.

The primary forecast problems involve the specifics of individual
shortwaves within the western trough and then their track and
intensity over the northeastern U.S. with a conflict of large
scale pattern teleconnections -- the Pacific/western U.S. pattern
favors above normal upper heights over the East while the
ridging/positive height anomalies northeast of Hudson Bay favoring
moderately below normal eastern U.S. heights. Overall the 00Z CMC
is notably different than the GFS/ECM/UKMET (namely with a more
southern Canadian cold core low/gyre), so it was not included in
the model blend.

Uncertainty still is noted with timing and strength of two waves
shifting east across the Great Lakes Friday night and Saturday
night. The 06Z GFS was much more potent with the second wave than
any other 00Z guidance and the 12Z GFS has backed off to a more
open and thus faster solution (where the feature quickly shifts
offshore over the Mid-Atlantic Saturday night) which is in better
agreement with the latest consensus.

The amplifying trough off the West Coast Friday night rounds a
lobe of low pressure that anchors over the Salish Sea Friday
through Sunday per the latest non-CMC guidance consensus. This
trough then swings east across The West and then support one or
more surface lows/fronts from the Plains eastward Sunday onward.
However, the details in this trough development/progression in
deterministic guidance is different enough to warrant some
inclusion of 06Z GEFS and 00Z ECENS means even for Day 3. By
Monday-Tuesday individual model runs and ensemble members
increasingly diverge for details at the surface and aloft east of
the Rockies, perhaps reflecting the competing teleconnection
tendencies over the East. These differences, as well as decreasing
confidence for details within the western trough late in the
period, favor trending the initial 00Z/06Z operational/ensemble
model blend used through Day 5 to lean more toward the ECENS and
GEFS means for Days 6/7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwave troughs/energy rounding a persistent upper trough
aligned near the West Coast will periodically enhance the flow of
moisture into the West, with areas of focused/terrain-enhanced
precipitation extending from the coast into the Rockies. Expect
episodes of moderate to heavy precipitation from the Cascades and
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest into California, which will
increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to local runoff. The
highest precipitation/liquid equivalents should extend from the
Oregon Cascades into northwest California and the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful precipitation will also be likely across the highest
terrain of the Great Basin and the central/northern Rockies.
Colder air filtering into the Pacific Northwest will bring snow
levels to sea level by Saturday night while other parts of the
West will also see declining snow levels as the upper trough axis
nudges eastward.

It is looking likely that two areas of precipitation in the
northeastern quadrant of the CONUS will accompany a pair of
shortwave troughs Saturday/Sunday with the first pushing off New
England Saturday/Christmas morning and the next crossing from the
central Plains Saturday morning and the northern Mid-Atlantic
Saturday night. Wintry weather is likely on the north side of both
these waves from the Upper Great Lakes through New England. The
next wave looks to take a more northern route, tracking from the
central Plains to the Lake Superior and into Canada Sunday/Monday.


The southern half of the Great Plains will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies during the period with decent
coverage of max/min readings 20-30F above normal.  Such
temperatures look to challenge daily high max records across much
of Texas Saturday through Monday and maybe Tuesday. This warmth
will expand east with the northern extent determined by
system/frontal progression over the northern tier. Anomalies
should become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme by next
Tuesday as the mean troughing continues to broaden and shift
eastward toward the Rockies. Meanwhile temperatures of 20 to 40F
below normal will push across MT/ND this weekend, expanding to
SD/MN by Monday with closer to normal winter temperatures reaching
the central Plains and Upper Great Lakes by Tuesday.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Today's guidance continues to show a very amplified Pacific into
Alaska upper ridge supporting a deep upper trough over the West
Coast/Interior West, anchored by a mean low over western Canada.
The trough will maintain a lengthy period of chilly and wet/snowy
conditions over West with the highest five-day liquid equivalents
likely to be between the Cascades and Sierra Nevada.  Individual
shortwaves ejecting from the upper trough and carried along in
fast west-southwesterly mean flow will support a series of
waves/frontal systems to the east of the Rockies, bringing snow to
northern areas and rain farther south.  Predictability for system
details has been and probably will continue to be a lot lower than
that for the large scale mean pattern.  Associated fronts will
separate a pronounced temperature contrast, between well above
normal readings over and east of the southern half or so of the
Plains and much below normal temperatures settling over the far
northern Plains.

The forecast over the East during Christmas weekend is more
uncertain than typically would be the case for the days 3-4 time
frame.  Starting with yesterday's 00Z ECMWF, guidance has recently
changed some details for West Coast shortwave evolution around
Thursday-Friday.  This has led to a dampening of a wave reaching
the Great Lakes by the start of the period while enhancing a
trailing wave to the southwest.  Still there significant
differences for the second wave even in the new 00Z guidance,
ranging between the GFS that remains quite strong like its 18Z run
(and faster 12Z run) and the weak/suppressed CMC.

Behind this leading system, the next well-defined shortwave
digging into the mean trough should be near the West Coast early
Christmas Day/Saturday and eject through/beyond the West
thereafter, bringing a system into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
around Monday.  Latest GFS runs are somewhat weaker and more
suppressed than most other guidance while the 00Z GEFS mean offers
a slight nudge in the consensus direction.  Then another feature
trails by about two days, bringing a wave into the East by next
Wednesday, while additional energy (with a little more spread for
shape, and possibly supporting a surface system) should arrive
near the West Coast around midweek as well.

The 12Z UKMET was out of sync with an average of other guidance
over the East early in the period so the first part of the
forecast consisted of a blend of other models and a small 18Z
GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean component.  Then ensemble weight gradually
increased to 30-50 percent late in the period.  The end result
reflected varying ideas of continuity and guidance trends while
staying on the conservative side where guidance spread was the
greatest.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The forecast remains little changed, with shortwave troughs/energy
rounding a persistent upper trough aligned near or inland from the
West Coast periodically enhancing the flow of moisture into the
West.  Areas of focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation will extend
from the coast into the Rockies.  The best potential for episodes
of moderate to heavy precipitation and highest five-day totals
will extend from the Cascades and coastal areas of the Pacific
Northwest into northern California and the Sierra Nevada.  At
lower elevations the continued rainfall will increase the soil
saturation and sensitivity to local runoff.  Meaningful
precipitation will also be likely across the highest terrain of
the Great Basin and the central/northern Rockies. Colder air
filtering into the Pacific Northwest will bring snow levels to sea
level by Saturday night while other parts of the West will also
see declining snow levels as the upper trough axis nudges
eastward.

Generally fast-moving waves will periodically spread precipitation
across the northern tier states and over parts of the East.  The
majority of wintry weather should be confined to areas from the
northern Plains through New England.  Precipitation coverage and
amounts remain more uncertain than desired so continue to monitor
forecasts as details gain better clarity.  Depending on position
of the mean frontal boundary over the East and wave details,
rainfall could trend heavier over the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into
the Appalachians by Tuesday-Wednesday.

The southern half of the Great Plains will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies during the period with decent
coverage of max/min readings 20-30F or so above normal.  Such
temperatures look to challenge daily high max records across much
of Texas from the weekend into early next week.  At times plus 20F
or greater anomalies may extend as far east/northeast as parts of
the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys ahead of each frontal system.
Anomalies should become somewhat more suppressed and less extreme
by next Wednesday as the mean frontal boundary east of the Rockies
pushes a little farther south.  Meanwhile the core of coldest
northern tier air will be over Montana and North Dakota where
temperatures will likely be 20-40F below normal.  The leading edge
of this airmass will make very gradual southeastward progress
during the period.  Western U.S. temperatures will trend colder
with the Northwest seeing expanding coverage of highs 10-25F below
normal next Monday-Wednesday.  Some locations in the West could
see daily records for cold highs.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST WYOMING INTO FAR
WESTERN NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will dominate much of the CONUS through today.
However, over 50 kts of 500 mb flow is expected to overspread the
central High Plains, where a mixed boundary layer will contribute to
downward momentum transport in terrain-favoring areas to support
favorable regional wildfire spread conditions. For much of the
grassland areas to the lee of the Rockies, fuels remain highly
receptive to wildfire spread.

Critical highlights remain in place to the lee of the Laramie Range,
where 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds are expected to
overlap with 15 percent RH for a few hours during the afternoon.
Elevated highlights have also been added to southern portions of the
Colorado Front Range, where some of the latest high-resolution
guidance has come into consensus in up to 10-15 mph sustained
westerly winds overlapping with 10-20 percent RH by afternoon peak
heating. Finally, Elevated highlights have been expanded across
central and eastern New Mexico, where 15-25 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will occur amid 10-20 percent RH.
Locally Critical conditions may be observed to the immediate lee of
the Sacramento Mountains.

A mid-level trough will amplify along the West Coast, encouraging
the intensification of surface lee-troughing and associated dry flow
across the central and southern High Plains tomorrow/Thursday
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added across northeast
Colorado, where 15 mph sustained southerly return flow is expected
to remain initially dry (i.e. 15-20 percent RH) for at least a few
hours during the afternoon. Elevated highlights have also been
introduced for portions of the southern High Plains, where 15-20 mph
sustained westerly winds are expected to develop to the west of the
surface lee trough axis amid 15-20 percent RH. In both Elevated
areas, finer fuels are at least modestly to highly receptive to
wildfire spread.

...Active weather with heavy mountain snow and lower elevation

...Periods of snow over the Great Lakes as wintry weather over
central and northern New England today gives way to cold and
blustery conditions tonight...

...Persistent warm and dry conditions over the central U.S. with
fire danger over the Front Range...

The western U.S. is entering a period of unsettled weather as
moisture from a large decaying cyclone off the West Coast is
forecast to push onshore.  The precipitation currently moving into
northern California is only a preview of what is to come during
the next couple of days as another low pressure system near the
west coast of Canada is forecast to track toward the Pacific
Northwest.  Active weather in the form of heavy mountain snow and
lower elevation rain will gradually engulf much of the western
U.S. through Friday morning under this weather pattern.  Major
mountain ranges such as the Over the Cascades and especially the
Sierra Nevada will likely see snowfall to be measured in feet.
Much of the northern Rockies and will get 1-2 feet during the next
few days.  For the lower elevations along the West Coast, a couple
more inches of rainfall can be expected where the rain will be
quite persistent and heavy at times.

A low pressure system is currently moving off into the Atlantic.
Another system, currently tracking across the Upper Midwest, will
go on to produce light snow showers across the Great Lakes tonight
into Wednesday. As this system intensifies tomorrow, snow rates
will pick up across parts of western and northern Maine, leading
to the accumulation of 6-10 inches of snow by Wednesday evening.
Some light freezing rain may mix in over parts of interior New
England.

Critical Fire Risk is in effect for parts of southeastern Wyoming
and northwestern Nebraska tomorrow, as winds pick up due to the
arrival of a surface low pressure system and humidity remains low.
Temperatures will steadily rise above average across the Great
Plains over the next few days as a dome of high pressure moves
into the region.

rain will engulf much of the western U.S. during the next couple
of days...

...Periods of snow over the Great Lakes as wintry weather over
central and northern New England today gives way to cold and
blustery conditions tonight...

...Persistent warm and dry conditions over the central U.S. with
fire danger over the Front Range...

The western U.S. is entering a period of increasingly unsettled
weather as moisture from a large decaying cyclone off the West
Coast is forecast to push onshore.  The precipitation currently
moving into northern California is only a preview of what is to
come as another low pressure system near the west coast of Canada
is forecast to track toward the Pacific Northwest during the next
couple of days.  Active weather in the form of heavy mountain snow
and lower elevation rain will gradually engulf much of the western
U.S. through Friday morning under this weather pattern.  Major
mountain ranges such as the Cascades and especially the Sierra
Nevada will likely see snowfall to be measured in feet.  Farther
inland, much of the northern Rockies will eventually get 1-2 feet
of new snow during the next few days.  For the lower elevations
along the West Coast, a couple more inches of rainfall can be
expected where the rain will be quite persistent and heavy at
times.

A low pressure system is currently edging gradually out into the
Atlantic, bringing an end to the rain across the Mid-Atlantic
coast.  Meanwhile, a coastal front is helping to focus a narrow
zone of wintry precipitation across central New England.  Another
system, currently exiting the Great Lakes, will help guide the
wintry weather northeastward through northern New England today
resulting in 6 to locally more than 8 inches of snow across
northern Maine.  The snow should taper off to flurries tonight
with cold and blustery winds rushing in behind the departing storm.

Periods of snow can be expected over the Great Lakes where a
stationary front lingers.  Meanwhile, persistent warm and dry
conditions are forecast for the central U.S.  These conditions
will promote fire danger especially over the Front Range of the
High Plains where downslope winds will prevail for the next couple
of days.  Temperatures will steadily rise above average across the
Great Plains toward the Great Lakes ahead of a warm front as the
large dome of warm air expands across the mid-section of the
country.

...Upper level low going cross country this week to produce heavy
mountain snow in the Rockies and severe weather in the Midwest...

...A pair of Pacific storm systems to kickoff an extended period
of unsettled weather from the Pacific Northwest to Northern
California...

...Temperatures gradually warming up in the East, staying
seasonally cool in the West; showers and thunderstorm possible
along the central Gulf Coast; Elevated Risk for Fire Weather in
the central High Plains...

An upper low over Utah is advancing east towards the central
Rockies later today, generating lower elevation rainfall and
periods of mountain snow along its route. Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued for parts of Wyoming, including the Wind River
and Big Horn mountains ranges where 1 to 2 feet of snowfall is
expected. Light accumulations are also possible from the Wasatch
and Colorado Rockies to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Within
the warm sector of a strengthening low pressure system over the
central Plains, scattered thunderstorms are expected to flare up
from central Nebraska to the Upper Mississippi Valley. In fact, a
Marginal Risk for severe weather is in place for parts of the
Midwest this evening. The wave of low pressure tracks into the
Great Lakes by Wednesday forcing showers and thunderstorms to
develop from the Midwest and mid-Mississippi Valley to the eastern
Corn Belt. This storm system's swath of heaviest rainfall is
forecast to occur from southern South Dakota and southern
Minnesota to central Wisconsin where over an inch of rain is
possible in spots.

Farther west, the West Coast is preparing for what will feel like
a never ending series of Pacific storm systems directing
atmospheric river after atmospheric river at the West Coast over
the next seven days. The first storm system arrives late Tuesday
into Wednesday ushering Pacific moisture into Northern California
and up the coast to western Washington. Some light snowfall
accumulations in the higher terrain of the northern Sierra Nevada
and Cascades are possible, but rainfall totals over one inch are
likely along the coastal range of Northern California and into the
lower elevated areas along the slopes of the northern Sierra
Nevada. Overall this is good news for drought stricken areas of
California and Oregon, but as an even more powerful storm system
approaches the second half of the week (and more subsequent storm
systems to follow in the medium range), burn scar areas could
become more subjected to debris flows and flash flooding. A Day 3
Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been issued for Thursday
in parts of Northern California for not only potentially heavy
rainfall rates, but to highlight the opportunity for debris flows
and rapid run-off near burn scar areas.

Elsewhere, high pressure sliding east over the Southeast region
allows for the return of southerly flow in the Mid-South today and
eventually reaching the East Coast late Wednesday into Thursday.
The result is abnormally warm temperatures making a comeback after
a few days worth of seasonally cooler conditions. Meanwhile, due
to the persistent rounds of upper troughs slamming into the
western third of the Lower 48, temperatures will generally stay on
the cooler than normal side, although some parts of the interior
Northwest may witness abnormally mild conditions. In the South,
areas of showers and thunderstorms may lead to locally heavy
totals along the Central Gulf Coast mid-week due to a weak
mid-level disturbance nearby. Last but not least, there is an
Elevated Risk for fire weather conditions in parts of the central
High Plains. Red Flag Warnings have been posted in southeast
Colorado and southwest Kansas due to the favorable fuels present
for fire weather.

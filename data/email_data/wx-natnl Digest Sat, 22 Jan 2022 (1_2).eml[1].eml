Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1019 AM CST Fri Jan 21 2022

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Morning observations support the ongoing forecast with only meager
potential for fire weather concerns. The dry air mass currently in
place over the southern Plains will reside within a surface ridge
axis with winds generally less than 15 mph. Strong Santa Ana winds
remain likely later this afternoon/evening along the southern CA
coast, but morning fuel guidance continues to show unreceptive fuel
statuses.

..Moore.. 01/21/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1132 PM CST Thu Jan 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Cool/cold temperatures will generally limit fire weather concerns
across the CONUS. A mid-level trough will move southward along the
West Coast before becoming a closed low across the lower Colorado
River Valley. High pressure will strengthen in the Northwest and
Great Basin. Strong offshore winds will develop in southern
California with upper-level winds supporting higher gusts. Despite
the strong winds and areas of lowered RH, fuels are not particularly
supportive of fire spread due to precipitation over the last month.

FOR SATURDAY JANUARY 29 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 04: As an amplified 500-hPa troug=
h
develops over the West, the risk of multiple temperature and precipitation
hazards are expected to increase throughout the western and central U.S. by
the
beginning of February. For the third consecutive day, reforecast tools are =
in
good agreement in depicting a 20 to 30 percent chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling into the lowest 15th percentile of the climatological distribution =
for
parts of the western and north-central CONUS. This slight risk begins on Ja=
n
31
and the magnitude of the anomalous cold is forecast to increase during earl=
y
February. The most likely area for much below normal temperatures (40 perce=
nt
chance of minimum temperatures in the lowest 15th percentile) exists across
the
interior Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies from Feb 2-4, based on good
agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Accompanying the
amplifying trough aloft and decreasing 500-hPa heights, a slight risk of he=
avy
snow is posted for the northern Cascades and northern to central Rockies fr=
om
Jan 30 to Feb 4. The ECMWF model remains the most amplified with the 500-hP=
a
trough over the West and wettest farther south across California and the Gr=
eat
Basin. Since the GFS and Canadian ensemble means are much less amplified wi=
th
the trough aloft, a heavy snow hazard was not posted for the Sierra Nevada
Mountains or Great Basin but may be needed in later outlooks.



Once the 500-hPa trough over the West becomes established, there is an
increasing chance of surface low development across the Great Plains with a
likely northeast track to the Great Lakes. Based on the evolving 500-hPa
height
and surface pattern along with precipitation tools, a slight risk of heavy
snow
is posted for parts of the central U.S. from Jan 31 to Feb 4. Due to model
differences on the amplitude of the 500-hPa trough upstream, it was necessa=
ry
to expand the spatial coverage of the snow hazard as the ECMWF (GFS) ensemb=
le
mean would favor a more northward (southward) track. The spatial extent and
timing will be refined as this potential winter storm becomes better define=
d
in
the next week. Meanwhile, in the predicted warm sector, a slight risk of he=
avy
rainfall (more than 1 inch per 24 hours) is posted from the Ohio River sout=
h
to
the Gulf Coast. This heavy rainfall hazard is supported by uncalibrated ECM=
WF
model guidance and consistent with the return of Gulf moisture later in
week-2.



A wind hazard may be added in subsequent outlooks if the model consensus
favors
the 500-hPa trough amplifying into the Southwest which would be more conduc=
ive
for gusty winds from the Four Corners region eastward to the southern Great
Plains. However, at the present time, only the ECMWF model depicts the trou=
gh
digging that far south. Given the widespread severe to extreme drought and =
low
soil moisture, any enhanced winds would increase the risk of wildfires and
dust
storms for these areas heading into February.



Following much below normal temperatures across the eastern U.S. during lat=
e
January, moderating temperatures are expected by early February. 500-hPa
heights are forecast to rise in response to an amplifying trough upstream o=
ver
the West. Therefore, the moderate risk of much below normal temperatures fo=
r
the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast is discontinued. Based on good agreement amo=
ng
the ensemble means with a low pressure system tracking near New England ear=
ly
in week-2, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted for eastern New England fr=
om
Jan 29-31. If the 500-hPa trough that results in low pressure development
shifts more westward, that would lead to a greater risk of a winter storm f=
or
more of the East Coast.



A slight risk of much below normal temperatures was introduced today for
extreme southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, based on goo=
d
model agreement and continuity. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicat=
e
that minimum temperatures have at least a 20 percent chance of falling into
the
lowest 15th percentile, beginning on Jan 31.

200 PM EST Fri Jan 21 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 24 2022 - 12Z Fri Jan 28 2022

...Overview...

A strong eastern Pacific ridge will help to maintain a broad mean
trough across a majority of the lower 48 through the middle of
next week.  Later in the week guidance suggests the overall
pattern may begin to shift a little eastward as Pacific energy
finally nudges the ridge into the western U.S.  This pattern will
favor temperatures that are slightly above normal over the West,
variable over the Plains, and mostly below average  over the East.
 A southern stream wave should produce an area of locally moderate
to heavy rain along/north of the Gulf Coast early in the week
while lighter precipitation spreads across the rest of the eastern
U.S.  Otherwise expect precipitation coverage and intensity to be
fairly modest over most of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The primary forecast uncertainties involve shortwave details
within the lower 48 mean trough, and by late in the week specifics
of Pacific energy pushing into the ridge that drifts into the
western U.S.  The southern stream shortwave emerging into the
southern Plains early in the week is fairly similar in the
guidance, quickly shearing as it becomes embedded within fast
flow.  Some fine-scale surface details that have lower
predictability 4-5 days out in time will still take some time to
be resolved.  Meanwhile guidance has been differing for specifics
of one or more shortwaves dropping into the Great Basin/Rockies by
Tuesday onward, with a blend approach looking best given
persistent differences among the models and between consecutive
runs.  An intermediate solution appears ideal along the West Coast
by Thursday-Friday.  Recent GFS runs through 06Z have been on the
slower/closed side with the Pacific energy (as was the 12Z CMC)
and thus keep more ridging over the West, in contrast to the ECMWF
that has been on the fast/open side with the shortwave.  Their
respective ensemble means are less extreme but with a tilt to
their models' relative timing.  The means have trended toward a
stronger and faster shortwave over the past couple days, which
would at least favor leaning away from the slow side of the
spread.  The new 12Z GFS/CMC have remained slower and closed while
the new 00Z ECMWF has trended slower (albeit straying to the
amplified side of the spread by early Friday), ultimately leading
to better clustering for now.

A 00z/06z operational model blend was effective for most of the
period. Some weighting was offered to the ensembles by day 5 due
to uncertainties with the Southwest shortwave. This weighting was
increased to 60 percent by the end of the period to account for
spread in the deterministics with respect to the incoming Pacific
shortwave.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A southern stream system tracking near the Gulf Coast Monday into
Tuesday should produce an area of locally moderate to heavy
rainfall across the far southern tier.  Highest totals are likely
be from around eastern Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley
during Monday-Monday night with a lighter trend farther eastward.
Also early in the week a separate wave/front crossing the East
will spread mostly light to moderate snow from the Great Lakes
into the Northeast.  Moisture in the northern periphery of the
southern system interacting with the front may lead to some snow
from the Ohio Valley into central Appalachians and could provide
some enhancement farther northeast as well.  Some lake effect snow
will be possible after the system passes by.  Another frontal
system reaching the Great Lakes late in the week could bring some
light snow to the region.  Aided by low level upslope flow as high
pressure builds into the central U.S., an area of snow will drop
southward through the Rockies and High Plains during the first
half of the week.  The rest of the West should be dry except for
possibly some light precipitation reaching the Pacific Northwest
late in the week.

Within the generally cold pattern over the eastern half of the
country, the East Coast will start out chilly on Monday with
Florida and the Northeast most likely to see min and/or max
temperatures at least 10F below normal.  The next Arctic surge
will bring readings down to 15-25F below normal over the
Midwest/Upper Mississippi Valley Tuesday into early Wednesday
while well below normal readings spread south and east through the
Plains and eastern U.S. into Thursday with some moderation over
the East by late week.  The Plains will see a warming trend
Wednesday-Friday with increasing coverage of plus 10F or greater
anomalies from northern into central areas.  Expect the West to
see moderately above normal temperatures next week.  Isolated
locations could see plus 10F or so anomalies.

...Significant icing across the coastal plains of the Carolinas
tonight; periods of snow in southeast Virginia and the Carolina
Piedmont...

...Arctic chill continues across much of the southern and eastern
U.S....

...Light snow across the Upper Midwest and toward the upper Great
Lakes; High Winds tonight and Saturday morning in California; snow
showers across southern Rockies move toward the southern Rockies...

An upper level trough tracking through the Tennessee Valley this
evening will induce a swath of snow and wintry mix across portions
of the Carolinas and southeast Virginia. The heaviest snowfall is
expected from the southeast Virginia Tidewater through the
Carolina Piedmont where snow totals up to 6" are possible. Farther
south in eastern Georgia and along the coast of both North and
South Carolina, an icy wintry mix will make for treacherous travel
conditions this evening and into the overnight hours. The areas
that stay predominantly freezing rain could receive 0.25-0.50" of
ice accumulation, allowing to the potential for widespread tree
damage and power outages. Periods of snow will linger into early
Saturday morning but bitterly cold temperatures in the storm
system's wake allows for snow covered and icy untreated roads to
remain hazardous for travel during the day Saturday.

Speaking of "bitterly cold temperatures" an Arctic air-mass
remains entrenched over the eastern U.S. on Saturday. Subzero
temperatures Saturday morning (with even colder wind chills
ranging between -10 to -20 in northern New England) are expected
while wind chills in the teens reach as far south as the central
Gulf Coast. Saturday's high temps will struggle to get above
freezing across the northeastern quarter of the Lower 48 while
high temperature departures along the Southeast Coast and along
the Rio Grande in Texas range between 15 to 20 degrees below
normal. Farther north, another cold front is set to deliver
another round of frigid temperatures to the North Central U.S.
this weekend. This front also produces snow showers throughout the
upper Great Lakes Saturday. Meanwhile, an Alberta Clipper ushers
in a round of snow to the northern Plains late Saturday as well as
another reinforcing shot of Arctic air across the Upper Midwest by
Sunday. By Sunday evening, a swath of light snowfall accumulations
are likely from the Dakotas to the lower Great Lakes. Latest
snowfall forecasts show the heaviest totals will be in the Upper
Great Lakes where lake effect snow bands could drop as much as a
foot of snow in parts of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Where the
Alberta Clipper tracks, anywhere from 3-6" of snow accumulation is
possible from southern Minnesota to northern Indiana.

Farther west, an upper low in the Desert Southwest will generate
unsettled weather for the Four Corners region while Santa Ana
Winds race through southern California. High Wind Warnings have
been posted just north and east of Los Angeles, the central Sierra
Nevada, and the coastal ranges north of San Francisco. An even
larger footprint of Wind Advisories is in effect through Saturday
morning from central California to the southern Great Basin. The
upper low is forecast to produce light snowfall accumulations from
the highest peaks of southern California to the Mogollon Rim of
Arizona and the southern Rockies tonight through Saturday. This
upper low will inch east on Sunday with only a few spotty showers
and some light snowfall accumulations in the higher elevations of
eastern Arizona and western New Mexico. Temperature-wise, the West
remains fairly mild overall with the warmest departures focused
along the West Coast. In the Great Plains, a warm front sliding
east gives way to warming temperatures throughout much of the
region. High temps by Sunday are likely to reach the 50s in the
central Plains, which is roughly 10 to 20 degrees above normal for
late January.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri January 21 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 27 - 31 2022

During the 6-10 day period, a large amplitude 500-hPa ridge is expected ove=
r
the Bering Sea, south to the Northeast Pacific. A significant pattern chang=
e
is
forecast over much of the CONUS, however, with a ridge evolving into a trou=
gh
over the Western half of the CONUS during the period, leading to small mean
500-hPa anomalies in the West. Over the Eastern half of the CONUS mean
troughing is predicted for the 6-10 day period as a whole, however 500-hPa
heights are expected to rise throughout the period, with the pattern becomi=
ng
nearly zonal by the end of the period. Today's manual 500-hPa blend favors =
the
0z ECMWF ensemble mean, which has shown the best run-to-run consistency ove=
r
the past several days. Recent ECMWF ensemble runs have consistently evolved
the
large scale pattern (troughing developing over the West and troughing
weakening
in the East) faster than the other models. Since today's ECMWF ensemble mea=
n
was favored, the temperature and precipitation tools based on the ECMWF
ensemble mean were given more credence than the GEFS or Canadian ensemble
means.

As forecast heights fall over much of the Western CONUS, surface temperatur=
es
are expected to decrease, leading to increased chances of below normal
temperatures over the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and Great Basin.
Over parts of the Southwest and Great Plains, positive temperature anomalie=
s
early in the 6-10 day period slightly favor above normal temperatures in th=
ose
regions. Well below normal temperatures (anomalies of -10 to -20 degrees F)
early in the period significantly increase chances of below normal
temperatures
for the eastern third of the CONUS, especially near the Southeast coast whe=
re
forecast negative anomalies persist the longest during the period.

As the predicted trough develops over the West towards the end of the perio=
d,
several shortwave troughs support an enhanced likelihood of above normal
precipitation from the Cascades east to parts of the Northern Plains. Behin=
d
the mean through forecast over the Eastern CONUS, below normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored near the Great Lakes. A potential storm system during the second ha=
lf
of the period is becoming more likely somewhere in the Eastern U.S., as the
past several runs of the GEFS, Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means forecast a
storm, though there is still a great deal of uncertainty as to where/when t=
he
system may develop. The general support for this storm to develop favors ab=
ove
normal precipitation for the Gulf Coast states, northward to parts of the
southern New England coast.

The forecast large-amplitude ridge forecast over Alaska favors near to belo=
w
normal temperatures for the state. This ridging and expected surface high
pressure covering most of the state reduces chances of above normal
precipitation relative to yesterday's outlook.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to a significant pattern change occurring during the period, and some
disagreement between the models and tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 29 - FEB 04, 2022

By the week-2 period, the forecast trough becomes well established over the
Western CONUS, while the predicted large-amplitude ridge persists over the
Northeast Pacific. The evolution of the 500-hPa pattern over the Eastern U.=
S.
is more uncertain. While today's GEFS and Canadian ensemble means forecast
weak
negative 500-hPa anomalies to persist over much of the East, yesterday's an=
d
today's ECMWF ensemble means forecast an increase in heights over the East =
and
more southerly flow when compared to the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means. =
The
ECMWF is still favored for the week-2 period due to better run-to-run
consistency and better agreement with it's comparable deterministic run, so
today's manual 500-hPa blend for the week-2 period depicts weak positive
height
anomalies over much of the East.

With the forecast trough becoming more pronounced in the West, below normal
temperatures are favored for the West Coast, Great Basin, Northern Rockies =
and
Northern Plains. The expectation that southerly low-level flow strengthens
ahead of the western trough leads to an increased chance of above normal
temperatures across the South Central CONUS. Colder temperatures forecast
during the beginning of the period for parts of Florida and the Southeast a=
nd
Mid-Atlantic coasts slightly favor below normal temperatures there.

Additional shortwaves in the forecast trough over the Western CONUS support=
s
an
enhanced likelihood of above normal precipitation for much of the western h=
alf
of the CONUS. Probabilities are higher over parts of Montana and Wyoming du=
e
to
the potential for upslope flow to enhance precipitation. One or more potent=
ial
storm systems developing in the eastern U.S. favors above normal precipitat=
ion
there.

Strong surface high pressure forecast over Alaska leads to increased chance=
s
of
below normal temperatures for the state. Very large positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over Alaska favor near to below normal precipitation across the
state.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensem=
ble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below Average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to large differences in the large-scale pattern between models over the
Eastern U.S. and significant differences between models and statistical too=
ls
over the East.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 AM CST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For today, a broad upper-level trough will exist across the upper
Midwest into the Mid-South. Farther west, a closed upper low will
slowly progress eastward within the lower Colorado River Valley
region. At the surface, high pressure will be situated across much
of the west into the Plains. Colder surface temperatures and light
winds will keep fire weather concerns minimal for most areas.
Offshore winds will continue across southern California into the
afternoon. Fuels are not receptive to fire spread due to recent
precipitation, however.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1223 AM CST Sat Jan 22 2022

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For Sunday, the closed upper low over the Southwest will evolve into
an open wave before reaching the southern High Plains. A shortwave
trough will quickly move southeastward out of Canada and into the
northern Plains. At the surface, high pressure will remain in the
West with a surface low developing in the upper Midwest. Overall,
fire weather concerns will be minimal due to cool/cold conditions
and unreceptive fuels. Offshore winds will continue in southern
California, though fuels will continue to be unsupportive of fire
spread.

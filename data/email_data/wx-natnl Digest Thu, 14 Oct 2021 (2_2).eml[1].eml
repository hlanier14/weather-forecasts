...Tropical moisture from former hurricane Pamela continues to
bring heavy rain and flash flooding today from south-central Texas
to southeastern Oklahoma...

...Threat of severe weather increases later on Friday for the Ohio
Valley ahead of a developing low pressure system...

...The cold in the West and the warmth in the East will shift
eastward heading toward the weekend...

The weather pattern across the mainland U.S. is forecast to
undergo a noticeable change during the next couple of days.  This
pattern change will shift the prevailing cold pattern in the West
and the persistent warmth in the East eastward as we head toward
the weekend.  First of all, the intense low pressure system that
has brought heavy snow and high winds across the northern/central
Rockies into the High Plains is getting ready to depart into
southern Canada.  The remaining snow and rain over the northern
Plains should come to an end by this afternoon although the winds
will remain rather strong and gusty.  This intense storm plays a
key initial role in eroding the persistent warm ridge that has
been anchoring in the eastern U.S.  Meanwhile, another low
pressure system is brewing over the southern High Plains ahead of
an upper trough sliding across the western U.S.  This system is
forecast to intensify while tracking toward the lower Great Lakes
along a frontal boundary during the next couple of days.  Showers
and thunderstorms are expected to form ahead of the system with
the best chance for the thunderstorms to become severe later on
Friday across the Ohio Valley.  By Saturday morning, the
showers/storms will likely reach western New England as the
intensifying storm moves into Ontario, Canada.  In the wake of
this system, the cold air in the West will be ushered into and
through the Plains states.  The coverage of warmth in the East
will then shrink as southerly winds spread the warmth further
north toward New England.

In the shorter term though, ample tropical moisture associated
with former hurricane Pamela surging into the southern Plains will
continue to create an environment ripe for thunderstorms capable
of producing intense downpours.  Several inches of rain are
possible between south-central Texas and southeast Oklahoma where
a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is expected for this
morning.  The heavy rain threat may also extend into parts of
western Arkansas and the Middle Mississippi Valley as well.  By
later today, the heavy rain threat is forecast to diminish quite a
bit as the main energy is forecast to shift into the southern High
Plains where a new low pressure system is forming.  Meanwhile,
moisture associated with the upper trough moving across the
western U.S. is expected to spread high-elevation snows across the
Intermountain region and into the central Rockies for today and
into tonight.  By Friday, a strengthening high pressure system
will bring drier and colder than normal conditions across the vast
majority of the West.  The exception will be near the Pacific
Northwest coast where a stream of Pacific moisture will bring
persistent rain into the region.

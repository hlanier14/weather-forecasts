.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1232 AM CST Mon Mar 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-to upper level ridging and surface high pressure in the western
CONUS (where the only dry fuels reside) will limit the overall fire
weather threat. Some dry and breezy conditions are possible in
eastern Montana and western North Dakota as an area of low pressure
moves across the Canadian Prairies and strengthens the pressure
gradient. However, fuels are still quite moist in this region and
therefore, no elevated area is warranted.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1253 PM EST Mon Mar 1 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 4 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 8 2021

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance, along with the 00Z ECMWF, are
in above average agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through
Friday across the continental U.S., and a general deterministic
model blend sufficed as a starting point in the forecast process.
By Saturday, the operational GFS becomes notably more progressive
with the shortwave crossing the Intermountain West compared to the
other guidance, including the GFS parallel, and the 12Z CMC
trended more in line with the slower ECMWF, although not as slow
as its 00Z run.  Since the GFS parallel version was closer to the
ensemble means, it was given more weighting for the second half of
this forecast period than the regular GFS, and more contributions
from the EC and GEFS means by next Monday.  In terms of sensible
weather, the heaviest precipitation appears most likely for
portions of the Pacific Northwest early in the forecast period,
and rainfall chances increase for the Florida Peninsula for this
weekend as the Gulf of Mexico low affects the region.  This low is
expected to track far enough offshore to keep most of the East
Coast region dry, but if future forecasts trend more towards the
northwest, then precipitation chances could increase for coastal
regions.  The previous discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest models and means continue to show a fairly amplified large
scale upper pattern featuring a west-central U.S./Plains ridge
between mean troughs over the eastern Pacific and East Coast.
Embedded within this pattern will be an upper low that should
reach the southwestern U.S. and then the Southern Plains after
midweek, followed by rather pronounced suppression of the upper
energy and surface reflection beneath the eastern mean trough
aloft.  The axis of this trough should be far enough eastward to
keep any developing Atlantic low pressure by the weekend/early
next week well offshore.  The eastern Pacific mean trough will
feature two primary features, one likely reaching the West Coast
early in the weekend (with leading wavy front) and then ejecting
inland followed by amplifying upstream energy that should bring
another system toward the Northwest toward late weekend/early next
week.

Guidance has stabilized since runs from 24 hours ago had adjusted
slower for the upper low tracking into the southwestern U.S. and
Southern Plains, followed by suppression of most moisture/surface
waviness around the southern periphery of high pressure that
builds over parts of the east-central/eastern U.S. and Southern
Plains.  Hopefully this evolution represents something close to a
"final answer" after multiple days of wildly diverse and
inconsistent solutions, first for whether an upper low would form
to begin with and then the low's track/timing.

The primary forecast discrepancy upstream regards how the leading
trough off the West Coast ejects inland after guidance maintains
good consensus into Friday.  Thus far there have generally been
two persistent clusters, a slower/sharper ECMWF-led majority that
ultimately brings the remaining shortwave energy
eastward/east-northeastward as it continues across the lower 48,
and the faster/flatter GFS-GEFS mean that take more of the energy
around the ridge.  CMC runs through 12Z have been somewhat of a
compromise.  A blended approach still looks reasonable, leaning
two-thirds or so toward the majority cluster near the West Coast
into Saturday while toning down the strength of this energy
relative to the 12Z ECMWF as it continues into the large scale
mean ridge.  The 00Z GFS/GEFS mean have adjusted a little slower
than their prior runs, the CMC has adjusted close to the ECMWF
idea, and the new ECMWF has become less amplified as the energy
ejects inland--in sum maintaining general support for current
preferences.  The next system that reloads the East Pacific mean
trough aloft shows fairly good large scale agreement in most
models and means (00Z CMC could be somewhat flat).  Thus a
model/ensemble mean composite represents the large scale pattern
well while downplaying low-predictability details during the
latter part of the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low likely to reach the Southwest/Great Basin area by
early Thursday will produce locally enhanced rain and higher
elevation snow over the Four Corners states with moisture then
extending eastward into the Plains.  Some moderate to heavy
rainfall is possible over the Plains but likely over a fairly
small area.  Then most of the rainfall should trend lighter as it
gets suppressed along and south of the Gulf Coast, though activity
could rebound again over parts of the Florida Peninsula during the
weekend.  Continue to expect any low pressure development over the
western Atlantic from the weekend into early next week to be well
offshore.  From late week into the weekend the eastern Great Lakes
could see some lake effect activity in prevailing cool cyclonic
flow.

Precipitation associated with the first eastern Pacific upper
trough/surface front will focus primarily over Vancouver Island
and into the Olympics at first and then extend southward toward
the central West Coast and possibly farther south over California.
 A frontal wave nearing the coast may support a band of heavier
precipitation by Saturday.  Rain and mountain snow will trend
lighter as the upper shortwave continues inland, with mostly light
totals over the Interior West and Rockies.  The next system should
bring another episode of rain and mountain snow to the northern
half or two-thirds of the West Coast.

Expect temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity to
remain well above normal through the period with plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs and only slightly less extreme for morning
lows.  The amplified pattern aloft will also bring a more moderate
warming trend to the West including warmest anomalies of plus
10-15F for highs from portions of the Interior West into the
Southwest and eventually southern Rockies.  Meanwhile the upper
trough near the East Coast will keep that part of the country on
the chilly side.  Highs of 5-15F below normal are likely to be
most widespread Friday-Sunday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1253 PM EST Mon Mar 1 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 4 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 8 2021

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance, along with the 00Z ECMWF, are
in above average agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through
Friday across the continental U.S., and a general deterministic
model blend sufficed as a starting point in the forecast process.
By Saturday, the operational GFS becomes notably more progressive
with the shortwave crossing the Intermountain West compared to the
other guidance, including the GFS parallel, and the 12Z CMC
trended more in line with the slower ECMWF, although not as slow
as its 00Z run.  Since the GFS parallel version was closer to the
ensemble means, it was given more weighting for the second half of
this forecast period than the regular GFS, and more contributions
from the EC and GEFS means by next Monday.  In terms of sensible
weather, the heaviest precipitation appears most likely for
portions of the Pacific Northwest early in the forecast period,
and rainfall chances increase for the Florida Peninsula for this
weekend as the Gulf of Mexico low affects the region.  This low is
expected to track far enough offshore to keep most of the East
Coast region dry, but if future forecasts trend more towards the
northwest, then precipitation chances could increase for coastal
regions.  The previous discussion is appended below for reference.
/Hamrick

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Latest models and means continue to show a fairly amplified large
scale upper pattern featuring a west-central U.S./Plains ridge
between mean troughs over the eastern Pacific and East Coast.
Embedded within this pattern will be an upper low that should
reach the southwestern U.S. and then the Southern Plains after
midweek, followed by rather pronounced suppression of the upper
energy and surface reflection beneath the eastern mean trough
aloft.  The axis of this trough should be far enough eastward to
keep any developing Atlantic low pressure by the weekend/early
next week well offshore.  The eastern Pacific mean trough will
feature two primary features, one likely reaching the West Coast
early in the weekend (with leading wavy front) and then ejecting
inland followed by amplifying upstream energy that should bring
another system toward the Northwest toward late weekend/early next
week.

Guidance has stabilized since runs from 24 hours ago had adjusted
slower for the upper low tracking into the southwestern U.S. and
Southern Plains, followed by suppression of most moisture/surface
waviness around the southern periphery of high pressure that
builds over parts of the east-central/eastern U.S. and Southern
Plains.  Hopefully this evolution represents something close to a
"final answer" after multiple days of wildly diverse and
inconsistent solutions, first for whether an upper low would form
to begin with and then the low's track/timing.

The primary forecast discrepancy upstream regards how the leading
trough off the West Coast ejects inland after guidance maintains
good consensus into Friday.  Thus far there have generally been
two persistent clusters, a slower/sharper ECMWF-led majority that
ultimately brings the remaining shortwave energy
eastward/east-northeastward as it continues across the lower 48,
and the faster/flatter GFS-GEFS mean that take more of the energy
around the ridge.  CMC runs through 12Z have been somewhat of a
compromise.  A blended approach still looks reasonable, leaning
two-thirds or so toward the majority cluster near the West Coast
into Saturday while toning down the strength of this energy
relative to the 12Z ECMWF as it continues into the large scale
mean ridge.  The 00Z GFS/GEFS mean have adjusted a little slower
than their prior runs, the CMC has adjusted close to the ECMWF
idea, and the new ECMWF has become less amplified as the energy
ejects inland--in sum maintaining general support for current
preferences.  The next system that reloads the East Pacific mean
trough aloft shows fairly good large scale agreement in most
models and means (00Z CMC could be somewhat flat).  Thus a
model/ensemble mean composite represents the large scale pattern
well while downplaying low-predictability details during the
latter part of the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The upper low likely to reach the Southwest/Great Basin area by
early Thursday will produce locally enhanced rain and higher
elevation snow over the Four Corners states with moisture then
extending eastward into the Plains.  Some moderate to heavy
rainfall is possible over the Plains but likely over a fairly
small area.  Then most of the rainfall should trend lighter as it
gets suppressed along and south of the Gulf Coast, though activity
could rebound again over parts of the Florida Peninsula during the
weekend.  Continue to expect any low pressure development over the
western Atlantic from the weekend into early next week to be well
offshore.  From late week into the weekend the eastern Great Lakes
could see some lake effect activity in prevailing cool cyclonic
flow.

Precipitation associated with the first eastern Pacific upper
trough/surface front will focus primarily over Vancouver Island
and into the Olympics at first and then extend southward toward
the central West Coast and possibly farther south over California.
 A frontal wave nearing the coast may support a band of heavier
precipitation by Saturday.  Rain and mountain snow will trend
lighter as the upper shortwave continues inland, with mostly light
totals over the Interior West and Rockies.  The next system should
bring another episode of rain and mountain snow to the northern
half or two-thirds of the West Coast.

Expect temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity to
remain well above normal through the period with plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs and only slightly less extreme for morning
lows.  The amplified pattern aloft will also bring a more moderate
warming trend to the West including warmest anomalies of plus
10-15F for highs from portions of the Interior West into the
Southwest and eventually southern Rockies.  Meanwhile the upper
trough near the East Coast will keep that part of the country on
the chilly side.  Highs of 5-15F below normal are likely to be
most widespread Friday-Sunday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CST Mon Mar 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

Recent high-resolution guidance suggests that an axis of 15 mph
surface winds will develop amidst very low RH values (ranging from
5-15% - lowest across eastern NM) D2/Tue afternoon.  While ERCs
aren't particularly high based on recent fuels guidance, finer fuels
will likely support grass fire spread given the recent very dry
conditions.

..Cook.. 03/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1233 AM CST Mon Mar 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak lee troughing in eastern Colorado may lead to some gusty winds
in eastern New Mexico. However, the lee troughing does not appear
strong enough for widespread winds in excess of 15 mph. Some dry
northwesterly flow will be present in the northern Plains, but fuels
are still quite moist in this region. Therefore, no fire weather
areas are warranted this outlook.

Recent high-resolution guidance suggests that an axis of 15 mph
surface winds will develop amidst very low RH values (ranging from
5-15% - lowest across eastern NM) D2/Tue afternoon.  While ERCs
aren't particularly high based on recent fuels guidance, finer fuels
will likely support grass fire spread given the recent very dry
conditions.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1233 AM CST Mon Mar 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Weak lee troughing in eastern Colorado may lead to some gusty winds
in eastern New Mexico. However, the lee troughing does not appear
strong enough for widespread winds in excess of 15 mph. Some dry
northwesterly flow will be present in the northern Plains, but fuels
are still quite moist in this region. Therefore, no fire weather
areas are warranted this outlook.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 01 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the western contiguous U.S.
resulting in enhanced onshore flow and chances for heavy precipitation across
California. As the mid-level low shifts further inland, the risk for heavy
precipitation is forecast to diminish, but cold temperatures are forecast to
become more prevalent across portions of the western lower-48 states.
Downstream, mid-level high pressure is forecast across portions of the central
and eastern lower-48 states. An active frontal region may set up across the
central CONUS in between the mid-level high and low pressure areas. Transient
mid-level flow is favored across Alaska with intermittent surface lows
forecast
to impact the western and southern parts of the state throughout the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of California, Tue-Thu, Mar 9-11.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Northern Plains, Upper and
Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, Tue-Mon, Mar 9-15.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevadas,
Tue-Wed, Mar 9-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Pacific
Northwest, California, Great Basin, and Southwest, Tue-Mon, Mar 9-15.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 04 - MONDAY MARCH 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!qEaHBoZ5RycKExpDG1rIzSl_XzP4HmSK96EHiYry1o3Y-RxWH3zuZQx9YGcNxVyzG8SjxJ4A$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 09 - MONDAY MARCH 15: At the onset of the week-2 period, the
6z GEFS, 0z ECMWF, and 6z Canadian ensembles are in good agreement in regards
to mid-level troughing along the West Coast of the CONUS. This feature is
forecast to push further inland as the period progresses, with the GEFS
depicting a quicker progression compared to the other models. The trough is
forecast to take on a positive tilt, thereby directing the most anomalous
onshore flow across California early in week-2. This region of onshore flow is
favored to gradually shift southward through the state as the mean trough axis
moves further inland. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts probabilities of at
least 20% for 3-day precipitation totals to exceed the 85th percentile across
most of California, with the highest probabilities (30%-40%) across the
southern coastal parts of the state. The GEFS reforecast tool is weaker,
likely
due to its quicker inland progression of the trough axis, but still depicts
parts of southern California having at least a 20% chance for 3-day
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile. As a result, a slight risk
for heavy precipitation is highlighted across most of California for 3/9-3/11,
with a north-south progression of the highest precipitation chances within
this
period. Periods of heavy snow are possible across the Sierra Nevadas, and an
accompanying slight risk for heavy snow hazard is depicted for 3/9 and 3/10.
By
3/11, the highest precipitation chances are favored to shift to southern
California, where any snow forecast is not expected to reach hazards criteria.



As the trough axis shifts further inland, colder air is forecast to build
across most of the CONUS west of the Rockies. The ECMWF is slower than the
GEFS
in terms of timing, but both tools show at least a 20% chance that minimum
temperatures fall below the 15th percentile by the middle of the period. The
GEFS reforecast tool is more expansive compared to the ECMWF with higher
probabilities extending through the Great Basin and into the Rockies. For now,
the slight risk of much below normal temperatures is depicted across parts of
the Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, California, and the Southwest, but this
may
need to be adjusted in future outlooks if the tools come into better
agreement.
Subfreezing overnight temperatures are favored across most of the highlighted
area, with minimum temperatures over some of the mountainous regions possibly
falling into the teens (deg F). Although slightly warmer temperatures are
forecast across the California Central Valley, patchy frost will be a concern
with overnight temperatures possibly dropping below 40 deg F.



This same trough axis is also forecast to result in one or more areas of
surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies during week-2. Impacts will
be
dependent on the exact track and strength of the lows, but increased chances
of
heavy precipitation are likely across portions of the Northern Plains, Upper
and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and the Ohio Valley where the
ECMWF
and GEFS reforecast tools both depict at least a 20% chance that 3-day
precipitation totals exceed the 85th percentile. A slight risk for heavy
precipitation is posted across these regions for all of week-2. Although the
greatest potential looks to be in the early to middle part of the period based
on the reforecast tools, the synoptic pattern supports the heavy precipitation
potential through the end of the period. Wintry precipitation is possible on
the northwestern side of these systems, with increased frontal convergence and
rain favored in the warm sector to the southeast of the surface low tracks.



A transient pattern is forecast across Alaska, with zonal flow developing
across the state. This favors multiple surface low pressure systems to impact
the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska during week-2. Given that temperatures are
also likely to average below normal, increased snowfall is also favored
especially across southwestern Mainland Alaska. The surface lows crossing the
Bering Sea are likely to increase the risk of high winds along the coast of
the
southwestern Mainland and over the Aleutians, however, wind speeds are not
forecast to reach hazards thresholds.

...Rain and thunderstorms will develop across the Gulf Coast
states through Wednesday...

...Light snow and gusty winds are expected in the Great Lakes to
Northeast through Tuesday...

A quasi-stationary front extending across the Gulf Coast will have
a low-pressure wave moving eastward from the Western Gulf Coast to
off the Southeast Coast by Wednesday.  Moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico will move northward over the boundary, producing rain and
thunderstorms along the Gulf Coast into the Southeast through
Wednesday.  The rain will slowly end from the Western Gulf Coast
to the Southeast during this time period.  A second front
extending from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic to the Middle
Mississippi Valley will move off the East Coast by Tuesday
morning.  The associated surface low over Eastern Canada will
deepen rapidly, producing a tight pressure gradient over the
Northeast into the Mid-Atlantic.  The tight pressure gradient will
produce a strong gusty wind over the region through Wednesday.
The gusty wind will end from the West to the Northeast.  Light
snow will also develop over the Great Lakes to the Northeast that
will wane overnight Monday.  A third front will move southeastward
from Central Canada on Tuesday afternoon, advancing to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic by Wednesday evening.  Light snow will
develop over part of the Northeast on Wednesday into Wednesday
evening.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy moves into the Pacific Northwest on
early Tuesday morning and moves eastward to the Northern Plains by
Tuesday night.  The energy will produce light snow over parts of
the Northern Cascades and parts of Northern Rockies on Tuesday
into Wednesday.  Additionally, an upper-level low will move
onshore over Southern California late Wednesday.  The low will
help produce light rain over parts of Southern California on
Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday evening.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon March 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 07 - 11 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast to be centered over the
Bering Strait and extend across much of Mainland Alaska. Positive mid-level
height anomalies are forecast over the Aleutians, the southern Mainland Coast,
and the Panhandle, associated with mean ridging over the Northeast Pacific.
Over the CONUS, troughing is favored in the West and along the Southeast
Coast.
Mid-level height anomalies are more negative in the 00Z ECMWF ensemble,
compared to the 06Z GEFS, with respect to these features. The locations of
these troughs in space are in very good agreement across the West. However,
the
magnitudes of the troughs along the Southeast causes differences in the
predicted 500-hPa height fields along the East Coast. Mean ridging and
positive
500-hPa height anomalies are favored elsewhere over the CONUS.

Mid-level negative height anomalies have increased in coverage across much of
the Alaska Mainland, relative to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast, favoring
increased probabilities of below-normal temperatures along parts of the Bering
Sea coast and southern Alaska, extending from the Alaska Peninsula to the
Panhandle. Odds tilt toward above-normal temperatures in the eastern
Aleutians,
under the influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge to the south. Enhanced
probabilities of below-normal temperatures along the West Coast and Great
Basin
are associated with mean troughing and below-normal mid-level heights.
Increased below-normal temperature probabilities are also favored in the
Southeast, in association with an exiting low-pressure system of the Southeast
coast early in the 6-10 day period. East of the Rockies, amplified ridging
favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal temperatures across much of the
central CONUS, extending into the Northeast.

Enhanced onshore flow favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal
precipitation in much of Mainland Alaska, with probabilities diminishing to
near-normal southeastward into the Panhandle, with increasing influence from
the Northeast Pacific ridge. Mean troughing centered just off the West Coast
increases probabilities of above-normal precipitation ahead the trough over
California into the Central Rockies. Additionally, there is the potential for
an enhancement of the subtropical jet by the Madden-Julian Oscillation during
the 6-10 day period, which may influence precipitation across the Southwest.
The manual 500-hPa height blend also suggests a positive tilt to the long-wave
pattern. This orientation increases the potential for energy to move eastward
along the Pacific Coast trough to the Rockies and amplifying thereafter over
the Northern Plains and Midwest, increasing odds for above-normal
precipitation
from the Central and Northern Plains to the Great Lakes. Over the Southeast
and
Southern Tier, below-normal precipitation is favored under strong mean surface
high pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good model agreement offset slightly by some disagreement among the
temperature
tools in Alaska, and the precipitation tools across the Northern Plains.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 09 - 15 2021

The predicted circulation pattern during the Week-2 period depicts an eastward
progression of the long-wave pattern from the 6-10 day period, with negative
500-hPa height anomalies moving over the Central and Northern Plains. Mean
ridging over the eastern CONUS is forecast to de-amplify during the Week-2
period, but remain, favoring positive mid-level height anomalies from the
Southern Plains to the Great Lakes, extending eastward to the East Coast.
Troughing over western North America is favored to become more meridionally
expansive, decreasing 500-hPa heights across southern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle. Above-normal mid-level heights remain across the Aleutians, under
the influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge to the south.

With falling heights heading into, and throughout, the Week-2 period across
Mainland Alaska, enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperatures are
forecast across much of the state. Probabilities of below-normal temperatures
diminish to near-normal in the Aleutians, underneath positive mid-level height
anomalies. Amplified troughing over the western CONUS favors enhanced
probabilities of below-normal temperatures along the West Coast, extending
eastward across the Rockies. Conversely, amplified ridging and mean southerly
flow across the eastern CONUS enhances odds of above-normal temperatures from
the Great Plains to the East Coast.

Strong onshore flow favors above-normal precipitation in much of Alaska, with
above-normal probabilities diminishing to near-normal in the southeastern
Panhandle, where near-normal mid-level heights are favored. In the western
CONUS, above-normal precipitation is favored near the base, and ahead of, the
amplified mean trough. Farther north of the leading edge of the trough, odds
tilt toward below-normal precipitation in the Pacific Northwest. Similar to
the
6-10 day period, the positive tilt to the long-wave trough suggests increased
progression of systems across the Rockies, aiding in  the extension of
enhanced
above-normal precipitation probabilities across the Central Rockies. Energy
exiting the Rockies is expected to amplify over the Northern Plains and
Midwest, increasing probabilities of above-normal precipitation from the
Northern Plains to the Great Lakes. Across the Southeast and Southern Plains,
below-normal precipitation is favored underneath surface high pressure that is
forecast to dominate throughout much of the Week-2 period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 45% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
model agreement with some disagreement among the precipitation tools across
the
southwestern CONUS. Uncertainty is also increased across the Northern Plains
with respect to the transition and amplification of short-wave energy over the
region.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

From late week into the weekend most guidance shows an amplified
upper pattern featuring mean troughs just off the West Coast and
near the East Coast along with an intervening ridge.  The ridge
will flatten later in the weekend as a shortwave ejecting from the
eastern Pacific mean trough progresses across the lower 48.
Upstream energy reinforcing the Pacific trough will drift toward
the West Coast early next week, with the trough axis possibly
starting to move inland toward the end of the period next Tuesday.
 At the same time low amplitude flow downstream (with perhaps a
lingering flat ridge reaching into the eastern half of the
country) will start to push away the East Coast mean trough.
Expect two main precipitation areas during the period--one from
the south-central Plains through Florida/extreme Southeast as a
system tracks around the southern periphery of the East Coast mean
trough late this week into the weekend, and a second area
along/near the West Coast with lighter amounts farther inland
ahead of the eastern Pacific mean trough.

The best clustering of guidance has remained fairly steady since
the previous cycle.  12Z/18Z runs were generally consistent with
their runs from 12 hours prior for the wave tracking across the
Gulf after some north-south oscillation over the past couple days
or so, and new 00Z models appear to offer good continuity.  The
shortwave reaching the West Coast around Saturday continues to be
a point of contention among the guidance but ongoing slower GFS
trends are adding further support to the ECMWF and most other
models that have been slower than the GFS over recent days.
Latest GFS runs are still somewhat fast but to a less extreme
degree.  Latest UKMET runs are in the minority with being slower
and more closed aloft.  In a slight nod to the GFS from recent
days, the past couple ECMWF runs through 12Z/01 carry the core of
ejecting shortwave energy somewhat northward from earlier runs.
By mid-late period the faster GFS timing for this feature could
lead to slightly premature departure of the East Coast mean
trough.  Meanwhile an intermediate/blend approach looks good for
the upper trough that begins to enter the West toward the end of
the period, with the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF displaying their
characteristic faster/slower timing respectively and their
ensemble means a bit closer to the average.  Predictability is low
for embedded details and any possible impulses ejecting from the
trough.  The new 00Z ECMWF has changed some specifics for both
primary features of interest, illustrating the ongoing detail
uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Plains upper low that opens up as it becomes incorporated into
the East Coast mean trough Friday into the weekend will support
rainfall of varying intensity from the southern half of the Plains
across the Gulf Coast and most of Florida/extreme Southeast.
Rainfall may trend heavier over Florida and vicinity with the
interaction of low latitude moisture and the wave/frontal system
crossing the Gulf.  As the surface low continues over the
Atlantic, guidance continues to show a track well offshore while
high pressure builds into the eastern U.S.  Ahead of the surface
high expect some mostly light lake effect activity to the lee of
the eastern Great Lakes.

The primary focus for rain and mountain snow over the West will
extend from the Pacific Northwest into northern California and the
Sierra Nevada.  The leading shortwave will bring one episode of
precipitation late this week into the weekend, including some
possible enhancement with a frontal wave.  Lighter amounts should
then reach the northern half of the Rockies as the feature
continues inland.  The next system will likely bring another
episode of rain and mountain snow to the northern half or
two-thirds of the West Coast with highest totals currently
expected from southwest Oregon into northern California and into
the Sierra Nevada.  Again lighter activity should spread farther
inland.  Depending on shortwave details, some precipitation could
start to develop over parts of the central U.S. by the first part
of next week.

Well above normal temperatures over the Northern Plains and
vicinity from late this week into the weekend (plus 10-25F
anomalies for highs and/or morning lows) should decrease by a few
degrees and reach eastward into the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes
early next week as a front pushes into the Plains.  Meanwhile
highs up to 10-15F above normal will progress from the Interior
West/Southwest into the southern Rockies and High Plains.  Behind
this area of warmth expect modestly below normal readings to
expand eastward from the West Coast during the weekend and early
next week.  East Coast locations will see highs 5-10F below normal
(and pockets up to 15F below normal) from late week into the
weekend followed by a warming trend.  Parts of the Northeast could
see highs at least 10F above normal next Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Tue Mar 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A surface low will traverse southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba
through the day today. The pressure gradient associated with this
surface low will lead to some breezy conditions across the northern
Plains. However, relative humidity is not expected to be that low,
and fuels are still moist in the area. Therefore, fire weather
concerns are minimal. In addition, some winds of 10 to 15 mph are
expected amid dry surface conditions from northeast New Mexico
across the TX/OK Panhandles and into southwest Kansas, as weak lee
troughing occurs in eastern Colorado. Winds are expected to remain
too light to warrant an elevated delineation.

A compact upper low is expected to move into southern California on
Wednesday. This will lead to strengthening flow across the Southwest

southwest Arizona into the Great Basin. However, fuels in this
region are not dry enough for any fire weather concern. Elsewhere
light winds should mitigate any threat for large fires.

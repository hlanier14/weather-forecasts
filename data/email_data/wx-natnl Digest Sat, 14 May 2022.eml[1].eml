...Persistent record-breaking heat is likely in the south-central
U.S. next week with periods of anomalous heat for the rest of the
southern tier as well..


...Overview...

Upper troughing should be exiting the East early next week, with
uncertain shortwave energy sliding through the Great Lakes and
Northeast around Thursday-Friday. After this, models suggest the
pattern over the CONUS may again amplify as troughing digs into
the West and upper ridging expands into the East. Meanwhile to the
south, strong and stubborn ridging will continue to promote
unseasonably hot weather across the Southern U.S., with the most
persistent and record-breaking heat centered in Texas and
Louisiana. The best focus for showers and thunderstorms should be
along a quasi-stationary boundary from the central Plains into the
Ohio Valley, while the West sees cooling temperatures in response
to upper troughing as the week progresses, along with lowering
snow levels by midweek within rounds of precipitation.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance remains in mostly good agreement with the
overall pattern during the medium range period, but with plenty of
uncertainties surrounding smaller scale features and evolution of
the trough out West later in the period. Timing of the trough out
of the East on Tuesday has improved, with models suggesting more
separation between this and a deep closed low over Hudson Bay
which looks to linger for several days next week. Even though the
bulk of this feature is well north of the CONUS, it should play a
role in the evolution of the pattern upstream over the West.
Models are split on how strong a leading shortwave will be across
the Northern tier Wednesday-Friday with the GFS and UKMET
strongest, and ECMWF and CMC fairly weak. Guidance shows some
varying run to run continuity suggesting low confidence on the
specifics of this feature which has important implications on
frontal positions and rainfall/convection. Despite the
differences, it seems the best approach was a middle ground so the
WPC forecast for days 3-4 was based on composite blend of the
deterministic models, though with more emphasis towards the ECMWF
which seemed most consistent across the board.

Big uncertainties begin as early as day 5 with a closed low off
the British Columbia coast which looks to dig into the Western
U.S. late next week. The 12z/yesterday CMC was significantly
weaker/less amplified with this trough through the Northwest with
more eventual interaction/phasing with the low over Hudson Bay,
but the newest 00z run (available after forecast production time)
came in a bit more amplified and closer to the consensus. Recent
runs of the GFS and ECMWF (along with the ensembles) show a more
amplified pattern across the CONUS by next Saturday, but differ in
the details of how to get there. WPC leaned on the ensemble means
to help temper these smaller scale differences, but with at least
half GFS/ECMWF to help with system definition.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial ridging across the Southwest and southern Plains and then
eventually rising heights farther east over the Deep South will
promote a broad area of heat across much of the southern U.S.
during the period. The greatest and most lasting anomalies through
the period should be over Texas (persisting from the short range
time frame) where some locations could see highs up to 15-25F
above normal, with numerous daily record highs likely. Parts of
the Southwest into the central Great Basin and southern/central
Rockies can expect highs around 10-15F above average for the first
half of the week before a cooling trend as the deeper troughing
presses inland. However, warm to hot temperatures could increase
for the southeastern quadrant of the U.S. later next week, with
potential for daily record highs.

A warm front lifting through the Mid-Mississippi Valley and Ohio
Valley will provide focus for multiple areas of showers and
storms/convective complexes during the middle to latter part of
next week. The ingredients are in place for heavy rainfall
somewhere, but plenty of uncertainty remains in the guidance with
respect to coverage and amounts, although it seems likely this
should present at least a localized flood threat given recent
heavy rains in some of these areas.

The series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-20F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Thursday-Friday. Snow levels
should lower as the week goes on as the main upper trough arrives.
A leading well defined front will press east across the region,
with rainfall likely arriving into parts of the north-central
Plains by next weekend.

...Summer-like heat in the Northeast will continue to challenge
daily high temperature records today...

...Hot spell for the Desert Southwest, Southern Plains, and
western Gulf Coast into early next week...

...Unsettled weather along the East Coast, Northwest, and in the
Mississippi Valley...

It'll be hot across portions of the interior Northeast today with
high temperatures in the 80s likely to compete for daily records.
Temperatures will remain above average before moderating a bit
early next week. Meanwhile, a low pressure system will bring rain
showers and high elevation snow to parts of the Pacific Northwest
this morning. Showers and thunderstorms are then forecast to
spread into the Northern Rockies this afternoon as daytime heating
brings potential instability to the area. Things will quiet down
in the Northwest on Sunday before another system brings some more
showers and thunderstorms to the region on Monday. Speaking of
thunderstorms, a slow moving upper trough will allow for the
potential development of severe thunderstorms along an attendant
cold front moving across the Mid-South and Midwest over the next
couple of days. Locally damaging winds and hail will be the
primary risks from this threat. Scattered to isolated
thunderstorms are possible across much of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast on Sunday and Monday afternoon/evenings due, in part, to
persistent upper troughing, the approaching cold front and diurnal
heating.

Upper-level ridging in the Southwest will allow for potentially
record breaking heat to visit the region as well as the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley this weekend. Highs in the 90s
and 100s may pose a threat to those with poor cooling or heat
sensitivities. The persistence of this upper ridge across the
southern tier states may become a problem as a prolonged heat wave
becomes a possibility heading into next week. Parts of southern
Colorado and the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles are within areas of
elevated fire risk this weekend due to relatively dry and windy
conditions.

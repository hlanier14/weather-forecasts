Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN IDAHO AND
SOUTHWESTERN MONTANA...

Widespread Elevated/Critical fire weather conditions are expected
today across portions of the Northwest and northern Rockies, where
the Elevated area has been expanded slightly in southeastern Oregon
and northern California. Locally Elevated/near-Critical conditions
may also develop in the lee of the Cascades where low RH (<25%) and
winds greater than 15 mph develop. For additional information please
see the previous discussion.

...Southern California...
Morning observations showed increased boundary-layer moisture moving
north into southern California and the western Great Basin. With
afternoon heating, a few thunderstorms may develop within the higher
terrain. Model soundings show steep low-level lapse rates in place
supportive of mostly dry storms. Any storms that do develop may pose
a low-end risk for dry lightning within receptive fuels.

..Lyons.. 09/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A series of mid-level impulses will traverse the northwest U.S.
while pivoting around an upper ridge/anticyclone centered across the
Interior West today. 30+ kt 500 mb flow will overspread the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies in tandem with the mid-level
impulses, providing upper support for dry and breezy conditions
encouraging modest wildfire-spread potential.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies...
By afternoon, boundary-layer mixing will encourage downslope flow
along the lee of southern Cascades/northern Sierra in southern
Oregon, far northern California, far northwest Nevada, and the
Sawtooth Range in northeast Idaho. At least 15 mph sustained
westerly surface winds are expected to coincide with 15-20% RH for a
few hours across southern portions of the Pacific Northwest, and
parts of the northern Rockies, where Elevated highlights have been
maintained. A Critical area also remains across portions of
northeast Idaho into far southwest Montana given the likelihood for
20 mph sustained surface winds to overlap with 15-20% RH for several
hours, and given the presence of critically dry fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical models are beginning to advertise a more amplified
mid-level height pattern over North America during week-2, with mid-level low
pressure centered over western North America increasing chances for below
normal temperatures, elevated winds, and enhanced precipitation across the
northwestern contiguous U.S. and the Alaska Panhandle. The development of
mid-level high pressure downstream is anticipated to promote above-normal, but
nonhazardous temperatures for many areas east of the Rockies during the
period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk for much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest, Northern Intermountain Region, and Northern Rockies, Thu-Fri, Sep
16-17.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Alaska Panhandle, Thu-Mon,
Sep 16-20.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Southern Alaska Mainland and Alaska
Panhandle, Thu-Mon, Sep 16-20.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Northern Intermountain Region,
Rockies, and the Northern and Central High Plains, Thu-Mon, Sep 16-20.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 11 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!soHTxe5w4TNuNg7DB67pEI3udSZxIE-iwPirxSbug5aJFMRYU-dLtdsbqXbbm0FEDNu-CMh4$

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 16 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 22: In the wake of a
transient,
mid-level trough that is predicted to weaken and lift out over southeastern
Canada early in the period, the latest GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor a more
amplified mid-level pattern to take shape across much of North America
compared
to previous guidance. Anomalous mid-level ridging is forecast to develop over
the northern tier of the CONUS that gradually strengthens through the middle
part of the period to promote unseasonably warm temperatures for many areas
east of the Rockies during week-2. Upstream, more amplified troughing is
advertised in both the GEFS and ECMWF that shifts south over the Gulf of
Alaska, where the latter model favors a broader coverage of negative height
departures overspreading the northwestern CONUS. This mid-level pattern shift
is conducive for cooler temperatures, an elevated potential for high winds,
and
enhanced onshore flow to increase precipitation chances over western North
America during week-2.



With positive mid-level height departures favored to develop early in the
period, there is fair agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depicting a broad region across much of the CONUS with at least a 20% chance
of
maximum daytime temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile. However, actual
temperatures are not expected to exceed excessive heat criteria and no
corresponding hazard areas are issued. The highest maximum temperatures remain
most likely across the Desert Southwest where daytime highs may reach 105
degrees F, and over 95 degrees over the south-central CONUS. In this part of
the country, elevated heat index values remain possible, including portions of
the Lower Mississippi Valley where many populations are still experiencing
power outages due to Hurricane Ida. This may exacerbate impacts for sensitive
groups due to the lack of available cooling resources in some areas.
Above-normal rainfall remains favored over portions of the western and central
Gulf Coast. There continues to be some indications in the guidance for
tropical
cyclone development in the western Gulf, though the heaviest precipitation
amounts now appear likely to occur late in week-1 tied to this potential
disturbance. Uncalibrated precipitation guidance shows some potential for
heavy
precipitation persisting into early week-2, however there are reduced chances
in the latest reforecast tools for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the
85th percentile and one inch, and the slight risk of heavy precipitation is
removed in the region relative to yesterday's outlook.



Tied to the anomalous troughing predicted aloft over the northwestern CONUS,
there is good agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools highlighting
a region over Oregon, Washington, and Idaho with at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and 40 degrees F early
in the period. Thus, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is issued
from Sep 16 to 17 as these colder nighttime temperatures may lead to early
season frost in the region. Additionally, surface low pressure is forecast to
form over the Canadian Prairies resulting in strong surface pressure gradients
and elevated wind speeds across the Northern Intermountain Region, portions of
the Rockies, and the High Plains. Given good support in the reforecast tools,
which both show at least a 20% chance for sustained winds exceeding the 85th
percentile, a slight risk of high winds is issued over these regions through
the middle portion of week-2. Combined with ongoing drought conditions, any
increase in sustained winds are expected to exacerbate multiple ongoing
wildfires that continue to reduce air quality and threaten life and property
across the West.



The amplified trough axis favored across western North America also favors
enhanced onshore flow and resultant increased precipitation chances across
much
of the Pacific Northwest, western Canada, and the Alaska Panhandle. This is
well reflected in the reforecast tools which depict an area inclusive of these
regions with at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile through the middle of the period. Although these
tools maintain increased chances for 3-day precipitation accumulations
exceeding 2 inches over part of the Alaska Panhandle to support the
continuation of a slight risk for heavy precipitation in the region (Sep
16-20), accumulations are not expected to be as high over the Pacific
Northwest, precluding a corresponding hazard area from being added at this
time. In accordance with the reforecast guidance, a slight risk of high winds
is maintained from Sep 16 to 20 mainly over the Panhandle, but now excludes
the
Aleutians and much of the southern Mainland relative to yesterday's outlook,
as
models favor a more southerly mean solution of the anomalous troughing aloft
and the associated surface low pressure systems that develop during week-2.
The
combined elevated risk of heavy precipitation and high winds over the Alaska
Panhandle favors an increased potential for debris flow and landslides in the
region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
227 PM EDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Sep 15 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal flow over the northern two-thirds of the CONUS with
high pressure over the southern third will persist this weekend
well into next week. This makes for a mostly dry pattern outside
of a frontal system tracking across the northern Plains and Great
Lakes and a plume of tropical moisture that threatens heavy rain
for the TX and LA coasts. Temperatures will generally be near to
below normal across the northern tier north of the front and near
the Gulf, but warmer than normal in between.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Notable model divergence in the flow pattern over the CONUS begins
Saturday night with recent runs of the GFS (including the 12Z
today) featuring a weaker and much faster trough crossing from the
Pacific Northwest by Sunday night. These quicker GFS solutions
then allow ridging to return across The West ahead of the next
wave in the middle of next week. Meanwhile, the 00Z ECMWF, 00Z/12Z
UKMET, and 00Z/12Z CMC all feature a more amplified, positively
tilted, and slower trough that lingers over the Pacific Northwest
through Monday with troughing lingering over The West until the
next wave arrives in the middle of next week. With a focus on
consensus, the forecast that is based on a deterministic blend of
global models on Day 3 quickly becomes non-GFS and favoring the
00Z ECMWF by Day 4 with increasing weight to the ECENS, CMCE, and
some GEFS through Day 7. Overall, removing the GFS from the model
blend makes for a slower progression of fronts/precip across the
CONUS than the previous forecast.

Near the Gulf of Mexico, there remains uncertainty with the broad
tropical plume shifting northwest to the Gulf Coast Sunday into
the middle of next week. All guidance was considered given the
general lack of trackable forcing mechanisms in the moisture
plume. 06Z and 12Z runs of the GFS are farther north up the coast
with their focus of QPF, highlighting the middle and upper TX
coast where prior runs focused on the lower coast/lower Rio Grande
Valley. The 00Z ECMWF also shifted farther east, featuring the
central Gulf coast (centered on LA) while the CMC (GDPS) continued
to generally keep heavy QPF offshore in the Gulf. Given this
uncertainty, the Days 4-7 QPF along the Gulf coast features a
compromise between the GFS and ECMWF, highlighting the middle TX
coast to the southern LA coast with an apex near Galveston
Bay/Houston metro. However, given the broad spread in guidance
(including the ensemble means), there remains a general heavy rain
threat next week from the lower Rio Grande Valley through the
central Gulf Coast and any particular areas of focus are likely to
continue shifting.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The frontal boundary over the northern tier will likely only
support light rainfall for the northern Plains/Rockies before a
modest injection of moisture from the south should promote more
scattered showers across the Upper Miss Valley/Great Lakes Tuesday
into Wednesday. This should slide into the Northeast Wednesday per
current timing. As noted above there is a multi-day potential for
heavy rain across the western and central Gulf Coasts later Sunday
into or through the middle of next week with confidence on
location pending any organization/focused area development.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge and south of the
surface boundary this weekend from the southern Rockies and
eastward. High temperatures look to be 10 to 15 degrees above
normal over the southern Rockies/Plains Saturday when several high
temperature records will be challenged. This area of warmth will
temper a bit as anomalies of generally 5 to 10 degrees above
normal cross the Middle Mississippi, Ohio Valleys, and then
Mid-Atlantic next week. Temperatures along the Canadian border
will linger near to below normal through the period. Areas around
the Gulf will see typical mid-September temperatures in the upper
80s to around 90F with plenty of humidity.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed September 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 14 - 18 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions from the ECMWF, GEFS, and CMC generally depict
low amplitude 500-hPa flow across much of the forecast domain. The main
westerlies are forecast near the Canadian border with an anomalously deep mean
trough progressing west to east across the Gulf of Alaska. Predicted mid-level
flow across the Lower 48 is relatively weak due to a more progressive pattern
forecast over the CONUS. Subtropical ridging is forecast over much of the
southern two-thirds of the CONUS, with the strongest positive height anomalies
focused over the mid-Atlantic. Models have trended toward lowering heights
over
the north-central CONUS, which is consistent with composites from the current
phase of the MJO.

With low amplitude flow and subtropical ridging expected across much of North
America, above normal temperatures are favored over most of the CONUS. The
highest probabilities (exceeding 70 percent) for above normal temperatures are
indicated near the Four Corners Region and parts of the Eastern U.S. Due to
the
trend toward lower heights across the north-central CONUS during the 6-10 day
period, probabilities are lower from parts of the Northern Plains and western
Great Lakes region. Troughing and below normal heights are expected across
most
of Alaska, leading to enhanced probabilities of near to below normal
temperatures across the state. This trough is forecast to progress to the
south
and east during the 6-10 day period, favoring below normal temperatures
extending into the Northwestern CONUS.

As a forecast trough moves south and east of Mainland Alaska, the storm track
is expected to shift to the south, favoring above normal precipitation for the
Alaska Panhandle and into the Pacific Northwest. In addition the Aleutians and
Mainland Alaska are expected to remain relatively dry, favoring near to below
normal precipitation for those areas. Beneath predicted subtropical ridging,
most of the western CONUS is favored to have near to below normal. A forecast
frontal system moving across the central and eastern portions of the U.S.
increases chances of above normal precipitation across parts of eastern Texas,
the Lower and Middle Mississippi Valleys, and the Northeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Yesterday's operational
12z ECMWF centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by a relatively low-
amplitude
pattern across the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 16 - 22 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern is forecast to become more
amplified, with a mean trough strengthening across parts of the northwestern
CONUS, and downstream ridging amplifying over the remaining portions of the
Lower 48. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are expected to persist over much
of Alaska. These negative height anomalies favor near to below normal
temperatures across Alaska, and including the Pacific Northwest as the
forecast
trough moves eastward during the later portion of the week-2 period. The
predicted amplification of the pattern across most of the U.S. leads to
increasing positive 500-hPa anomalies and above normal temperatures over much
of the Lower 48. As the predicted trough moves south and east across the
Pacific Northwest, Alaska is expected to become even drier than the 6-10 day
period, with an enhanced likelihood of near to below normal precipitation for
the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska. This also leads to increased probabilities
of above normal precipitation spreading further into the northwestern CONUS
than the 6-10 day period. A strengthening ridge forecast over much of the
CONUS
favors near to below normal precipitation over most of the rest of the Lower
48, except along portions of the Gulf Coast, where leftover frontal activity
and the potential (though uncertainty is high) for tropical moisture favors
above normal precipitation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's
operational 0z GFS centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement among the models and tools, and a relatively amplified pattern
across the domain.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN IDAHO AND SOUTHWEST
MONTANA...

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Latest hi-res guidance has trended drier with the surge of monsoon
and Pacific moisture expected ahead of a shortwave troughing moving
onshore. Regional model soundings show weak instability developing
through the day with PWAT values generally less than an inch across
portions of California, the Great Basin and the Northwest. This will
favor a drier storm mode with a greater potential for dry lightning
strikes. The greatest coverage of storms is expected across far
southeastern Oregon and northern California/Nevada late Thursday
into the overnight hours Friday with more isolated storms expected
farther south across central California. Given record fuels across
much of California, northern Nevada and portions of southeastern
Oregon, widespread dry thunder probabilities have been introduced to
cover the threat for isolated to widely scattered thunderstorms.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with only minor
adjustments to the Elevated area across southern Wyoming for the
latest guidance.

..Lyons.. 09/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Wed Sep 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
Widespread 30-40 kt 500 mb flow will pivot around a persistent
mid-level ridge/anticyclone across the Interior West while
accompanying a series of progressive mid-level impulses, and
overspread the Pacific Northwest, northern Great Basin, and northern
Rockies to the northern High Plains tomorrow/Thursday. Widespread
dry and breezy conditions are expected across a large part of the
northwest CONUS, where modestly to critically dry fuels are in place
to support wildfire-spread.

Elevated highlights have been introduced where 15+ mph surface
sustained westerly winds will overlap with 15-25% RH for at least a
few hours tomorrow afternoon. Critical highlights have been
introduced to portions of northeast Idaho into far southwest Montana
in proximity to the Sawtooth Range, as the strongest mid-level flow
is expected overspread this region, supporting surface winds
occasionally reaching 20+ mph. While favorable upper support for
surface wildfire-spread conditions will remain along the northern
periphery of the upper ridge, a very dry, mixed boundary layer
across western parts of the Great Basin is expected to compensate
and support Elevated conditions tomorrow afternoon and evening.

In addition, mid-level moisture (albeit meager) will meander
northward along the western periphery of the Interior West
anticyclone. Associated buoyancy is expected to remain scant across
Nevada into the southern Sierra, with only a sparse dry thunderstorm
possible tomorrow afternoon, precluding isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights at this time.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms and excessive
rainfall over parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic through Thursday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Florida Panhandle through Thursday morning...

...A heatwave will encompass much of the West with record high
temperatures possible...

A front extending from the Lower Great Lakes/Mid-Atlantic to the
Southern High Plains will slowly move eastward off the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic Coast by Friday morning.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front over the
Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.
Upper-level dynamics have led the SPC to issue a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
through Thursday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Furthermore, heavy rain is
associated with these thunderstorms that will fall over areas
where IDA produced heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms through
Thursday.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly localized
areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small
streams the most vulnerable. The severe thunderstorm threat
decreases to scattered thunderstorms on Thursday over parts of the
Northeast and the Atlantic Coast.  The excessive rainfall will
also decrease slightly over the Northeast.

Meanwhile, numerous showers and thunderstorms over the Central and
Eastern Gulf Coast will produce heavy rain over portions of the
area.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Florida Panhandle with these
thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable through Thursday morning.

Elsewhere, an upper-level high over the Great Basin will aid in
producing record high temperatures over the Western States through
Thursday, then over parts of the Central Rockies and the
Central/Southern High Plains on Friday.  Furthermore, the dry
weather associated with the upper-level high will and gusty winds
has led to an increase in the fire weather threat over parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region/Northern Rockies as a Critical
Risk of fire weather is posted. Red Flag Warnings over parts of
the Northwest into the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains.
In addition, Excessive Heat Warnings are posted over Southeastern
California, southern Nevada, and parts of northwestern Arizona.
Heat Advisories are also issued over most of California. However,
Air Quality Alerts have also been published over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire
smoke.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
500 PM EDT Wed Sep 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021 - 12Z Wed Sep 15 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal flow over the northern two-thirds of the CONUS with
high pressure over the southern third will persist this weekend
well into next week. This makes for a mostly dry pattern outside
of a frontal system tracking across the northern Plains and Great
Lakes and a plume of tropical moisture that threatens heavy rain
for the TX and LA coasts. Temperatures will generally be near to
below normal across the northern tier north of the front and near
the Gulf, but warmer than normal in between.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Notable model divergence in the flow pattern over the CONUS begins
Saturday night with recent runs of the GFS (including the 12Z
today) featuring a weaker and much faster trough crossing from the
Pacific Northwest by Sunday night. These quicker GFS solutions
then allow ridging to return across The West ahead of the next
wave in the middle of next week. Meanwhile, the 00Z ECMWF, 00Z/12Z
UKMET, and 00Z/12Z CMC all feature a more amplified, positively
tilted, and slower trough that lingers over the Pacific Northwest
through Monday with troughing lingering over The West until the
next wave arrives in the middle of next week. With a focus on
consensus, the forecast that is based on a deterministic blend of
global models on Day 3 quickly becomes non-GFS and favoring the
00Z ECMWF by Day 4 with increasing weight to the ECENS, CMCE, and
some GEFS through Day 7. Overall, removing the GFS from the model
blend makes for a slower progression of fronts/precip across the
CONUS than the previous forecast.

Near the Gulf of Mexico, there remains uncertainty with the broad
tropical plume shifting northwest to the Gulf Coast Sunday into
the middle of next week. All guidance was considered given the
general lack of trackable forcing mechanisms in the moisture
plume. 06Z and 12Z runs of the GFS are farther north up the coast
with their focus of QPF, highlighting the middle and upper TX
coast where prior runs focused on the lower coast/lower Rio Grande
Valley. The 00Z ECMWF also shifted farther east, featuring the
central Gulf coast (centered on LA) while the CMC (GDPS) continued
to generally keep heavy QPF offshore in the Gulf. Given this
uncertainty, the Days 4-7 QPF along the Gulf coast features a
compromise between the GFS and ECMWF, highlighting the middle TX
coast to the southern LA coast with an apex near Galveston
Bay/Houston metro. However, given the broad spread in guidance
(including the ensemble means), there remains a general heavy rain
threat next week from the lower Rio Grande Valley through the
central Gulf Coast and any particular areas of focus are likely to
continue shifting.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The frontal boundary over the northern tier will likely only
support light rainfall for the northern Plains/Rockies before a
modest injection of moisture from the south should promote more
scattered showers across the Upper Miss Valley/Great Lakes Tuesday
into Wednesday. This should slide into the Northeast Wednesday per
current timing. As noted above there is a multi-day potential for
heavy rain across the western and central Gulf Coasts later Sunday
into or through the middle of next week with confidence on
location pending any organization/focused area development.

Temperatures will be above normal under the ridge and south of the
surface boundary this weekend from the southern Rockies and
eastward. High temperatures look to be 10 to 15 degrees above
normal over the southern Rockies/Plains Saturday when several high
temperature records will be challenged. This area of warmth will
temper a bit as anomalies of generally 5 to 10 degrees above
normal cross the Middle Mississippi, Ohio Valleys, and then
Mid-Atlantic next week. Temperatures along the Canadian border
will linger near to below normal through the period. Areas around
the Gulf will see typical mid-September temperatures in the upper
80s to around 90F with plenty of humidity.

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 12 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 16 2021

...Overview...

Quasi-zonal flow over the northern two-thirds of the CONUS with
ridging along 30N will persist through the period. This makes for
a mostly dry pattern outside of a frontal system tracking across
the northern tier and a plume of tropical moisture that may
suppoer a heavy rain threat for parts of the TX and LA coasts.
Temperatures will generally be near to below normal across the
northern tier north of the front and near the Gulf, but warmer
than normal in between from the Southwest to the Mid-Atlantic.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The guidance continues to have problems resolving the eastern
Pacific flow into the West that translates downstream next week,
showing important differences even before the medium range period.
The GFS and many GEFS members generally detached a portion of an
eastern Pacific trough much more than the other models/ensembles,
allowing its northern part to move swiftly eastward next week,
well ahead of the larger consensus that includes the ECMWF,
Canadian, and UKMET. Once that timing difference starts, it
expands through the period rendering an all-encompassing blend
ineffectual. Preferred the non-GFS consensus that was closer to
continuity but realize that the GFS does present a plausible
solution. However, opted to rely on the older 00Z/08 ECMWF rather
than its even slower 12Z/08 run. Its 12Z/08 ensemble mean was
weighed most heavily after next Tuesday as it was preferred over
the quicker GEFS mean.

Around the Gulf of Mexico, there remains uncertainty with the
broad tropical plume shifting northwestward to the northwest Gulf
Coast Sunday into the middle of next week. All guidance was
considered given the general lack of trackable forcing mechanisms
in the moisture plume. There remains a general heavy rain threat
next week from the lower Rio Grande Valley through the central
Gulf Coast and any particular areas of focus are likely to
continue shifting with each model run. Potential exists for
several inches over the multi-day period.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The frontal boundary over the northern tier will likely only
support light rainfall for the Great Lakes Sunday until a modest
injection of moisture from the south should promote more scattered
showers across the Upper MS Valley/Great Lakes Tuesday into
Wednesday. This should slide into the Northeast Wednesday per
current timing. Over the middle MS Valley, the tail-end of the
frontal boundary will act as another focus for showers on Tuesday
into Wednesday as the front eventually lifts northward.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 deg F above normal under the ridge
and south of the surface boundary from the Four Corners/southern
Rockies and points eastward. This area of warmth will temper a bit
as anomalies of generally 5 to 10 degrees above normal cross the
Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys and into the Mid-Atlantic next
week. Temperatures along the Canadian border will linger near to
below normal through the period. Areas around the Gulf will see
typical mid-September temperatures in the upper 80s to around 90F
with plenty of humidity yielding heat indices near 100F.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CDT Thu Sep 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN OREGON INTO
EXTREME NORTHEAST CALIFORNIA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST IDAHO INTO
FAR SOUTHWEST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
An active fire weather day appears likely across portions of the
Interior west this afternoon through tonight, as the upper ridge
over the region begins to break down and a mid-level trough impinges
on the West Coast. Widespread 35-50 kts of 500 mb flow will pivot
around the interior-West upper anticyclone and support dry and
breezy conditions conducive to fire spread across portions of the
western Great Basin northeastward to the northern High Plains.
Deep-layer ascent associated with the approaching upper trough will
also support isolated to scattered thunderstorms across the western
Great Basin and portions of the Pacific Northwest into the northern
Rockies. Several fire starts will be possible where thunderstorms
occur given the extremely dry fuels in place.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A plume of mid-level moisture will continue to spread northwest
across the western Great Basin, Pacific Northwest, and northern
Rockies through the day. Daytime heating of the boundary layer,
along with gradually increasing deep-layer ascent with the
approaching upper trough, will serve to initiate thunderstorms by
21Z. Thereafter, storm coverage will increase within the 00-06Z time
frame. Precipitable water values from central Nevada northwestward
to central Oregon and eastward to south-central Montana are expected
to peak in the 0.6-0.9 inch range. Classic inverted-V vertical
profiles extending up to 700-500 mb in forecast soundings suggest
high-based, dry thunderstorm modes. Isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights have been added where at least a couple thunderstorms are
expected to form from 21Z onward to the end of the period (12Z
Friday morning).

Of particular concern is a region from central Oregon into far
northern California within the 21-06Z period, where high-resolution
guidance consensus depicts a denser cluster of dry thunderstorms
moving across the region. Fast-moving storms atop a deep, dry
boundary layer will overspread an area characterized by record dry
fuels. As such, several lightning-induced fire ignitions/holdovers
may be associated with this round of storms. This may especially be
the case if subsequent rounds of storms/wetting rainfall late Day 1
into Day 2 end up occurring farther north than anticipated.
Scattered dry thunderstorm highlights have been introduced to
account for this scenario.

...Dry and Windy Conditions...
A dry, well-mixed boundary layer is expected to develop across much
of the interior West into the northern High Plains by afternoon peak
heating. The downward momentum transport of the stronger mid-level
flow, along with downslope flow along the lee of terrain-favoring
areas, will foster 15-25 mph sustained westerly winds coinciding
with 15-20% RH across a broad region of the West. Elevated
highlights have been maintained across parts of the western Great
Basin, into the Pacific Northwest, northern and central Rockies, and
northern High Plains, where confidence is highest in the
aforementioned surface winds/RH overlapping for at least a few hours
this afternoon into early evening.

The best chance for Critical conditions will be across northeast
Idaho into far southwest Montana. Here, downslope flow along the
Sawtooth Range, and downward momentum transport of the strongest
flow within the core of a 500 mb wind maximum, will support 20+ mph
sustained winds overlapping with 15% RH for at least a few hours.
Elsewhere within the Elevated delineation, at least locally Critical
conditions appear likely across portions of central Nevada, as well
as across portions of central into eastern Montana. However,
guidance suggests that the most favorable surface winds/RH overlap
will remain too localized and brief to warrant Critical highlights.

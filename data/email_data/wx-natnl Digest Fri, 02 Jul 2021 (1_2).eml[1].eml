Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1113 AM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN MONTANA...

Critical fire weather highlights have been added for parts of
eastern Montana for this afternoon into early evening. Visible
satellite imagery depicts clear skies across the state, with the
latest METAR observations showing surface temperatures climbing into
the 80s F with RH in the 20-35% range. The approach of a thermally
induced surface pressure trough will promote deep boundary-layer
mixing as surface temperatures climb to near 100 F. As such, RH is
expected to drop into the 10-20% range by afternoon peak heating. At
least 15-20 mph sustained easterly surface winds are expected on a
widespread basis, though several areas may see periods of 20+ mph
winds. While the meteorological conditions are expected to be
borderline Critical at best, record dry fuels are in place, with
ERCs suggesting that fuels are Critically to Extremely Critically
receptive to fire spread, warranting an introduction of Critical
highlights.

Otherwise, scattered thunderstorms are still expected across
portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies. This
region has the best chance at experiencing at least a few dry
strikes this afternoon and evening. Isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights remain in place, with only minor adjustments made to the
ongoing delineation to account for the latest guidance.

..Squitieri.. 07/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Within a weak and nebulous mid-level flow pattern with persistent
mid-level ridging, minimal deep-layer flow will be maintained over
the western and central U.S. To the east, an upper trough will
deepen across the eastern third of the CONUS. Fire weather concerns
will be limited in area and scope, given the weak flow regime and
widespread precipitation cross the CONUS.

...Montana...
As surface high pressure over the Midwest intensifies, easterly
low-level pressure gradients are forecast to increase across the
northern Rockies/Plains. Surface winds of 10-20 mph are forecast to
develop across central and northern Montana. Warm temperatures
beneath the ridge axis will support surface humidity values of
20-30%. With dry fuels in place, elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely.

...Northwest and Northern Rockies...
Scattered thunderstorms will develop with a surge of monsoonal
moisture from the Southwest and Four Corners, into the Northwest and
northern Rockies. PWAT values will decrease with latitudinal extent,
with areas across the Great Basin and Southwest seeing the highest
values over 1 inch. The result will be a gradient in storm mode, as
wetter storms will be favored south, and drier storms to the north.
While a few dry strikes are possible in dry fuels with wetter
storms, the greatest risk for dry thunder appears to be across the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Dry thunder probabilities
have been shifted north to account for the threat of isolated dry
strikes in receptive fuels.

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast into next week
as Tropical Storm Elsa could impact Florida by midweek...

...Overview...

The large scale pattern is expected to become less amplified and
more typically summer-like during the medium range period as the
upper trough over the northeastern U.S. lifts into the Canadian
Maritimes early in the week. A seasonably strong upper ridge is
forecast over the Four Corners states, while a weak upper
trough/low may move across the south-central CONUS and help cause
continued rain chances, while the main jet stream/westerlies
meander over the northern U.S. and southern Canada. Additionally,
what is now Tropical Storm Elsa has the potential to impact
Florida around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

In terms of the overall midlatitude pattern, guidance is pretty
agreeable with the pattern described above. A mainly deterministic
model blend was able to be used especially for the first part of
the forecast period. The 00Z CMC was removed by around midweek as
it had a stronger upper low in the Eastern Pacific offshore of the
Pacific Northwest with a different evolution compared to other
models. There were some fairly minor differences with shortwaves
in the northern stream, which were handled by transitioning to a
blend favoring more of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

However, with Tropical Storm Elsa, guidance is quite variable in
terms of its track and strength. The 00Z ECMWF as well as most of
its ensemble members take a weaker Elsa fairly far east of Florida
into the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, the 00Z/06Z GFS take a
stronger Elsa into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, impacting the
western Florida peninsula, while GEFS members vary quite a bit on
their low tracks. The 00Z CMC appeared in between, and the 00Z
UKMET clustered fairly well with the GFS runs, but the 12Z UKMET
opens Elsa into an open wave by around Monday. Thus, uncertainty
is rather high with Elsa, and its track and strength uncertainties
feed on each other, as a stronger system could influence its
environment more and push westward compared to a weaker system
drifting/turning northeastward. The WPC forecast followed the NHC
track, which was closer to the GFS runs and the 00Z UKMET.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With an initial weakening front in the Southeast, and lowering
heights over the south-central U.S., there will be support for
persistent showers and thunderstorms in the Gulf Coast states next
week. The heaviest rain may be across portions of Texas, with
multi-inch totals likely to accumulate over a few days. Farther
west, some late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are
likely each day over the Central/Southern Rockies through the
medium range period. Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead
of a front from the north-central to northeastern U.S. And, heavy
rainfall and flooding will be a threat where Elsa ends up
tracking, along with high winds near its track. Current forecasts
show heavy rain for portions of the Florida Peninsula and across
the Georgia and Carolina coast around Wednesday into Thursday with
Elsa.

The historic heat wave will continue to lessen in magnitude by the
medium range period as the ridging weakens, but temperatures
nearing and exceeding 100 degrees (depending partially on
elevation) remain expected for the Great Basin and Northern
Rockies through much of next week. Some rain showers over the
northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they will
do little to ease the growing drought over much of the West. The
north-central U.S. can also expect a hot day on the 4th of July
before a cold front brings temperatures down toward normal on
Monday into Tuesday. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S. through the week
with the cloudiness and showers. Meanwhile, a cooler than average
July 4th is forecast for the Northeast, but temperatures warm into
the 90s by Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu July 01 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 07 - 11 2021

The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in good agreement and depict a high
amplitude longwave pattern for July with a 500-hPa trough (ridge) over Alas=
ka
(the western CONUS). The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean is less amplified and
appears to be an outlier among model solutions. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean =
is
most amplified with the western CONUS ridge (500-hPa height departures of +=
60
meters) and this model solution is favored since it has support from the
deterministic GFS model. Based on this amplified ridge and above normal 500=
-
hPa
heights, above normal temperatures are likely throughout the West along wit=
h
the Central and Northern Great Plains. Above normal temperatures are also
favored across the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, although
probabilities are much smaller compared to the West. Downstream of the high
amplitude ridge, a weakness in the subtropical ridge over the east-central
CONUS is forecast to persist through around day 7. This weakness in the
subtropical ridge coupled with the expectation of widespread precipitation
favors near to below normal temperatures across the Southern Great Plains,
Lower Mississippi Valley, and parts of the Southeast.

Tropical Storm Elsa recently developed to the east of the Windward Islands.=
 As
of 11am EDT on July 1, the National Hurricane Center forecasts Elsa to trac=
k
northwest towards Cuba and Jamaica this weekend. Model spread becomes large
regarding Elsas track by early next week, with outcomes ranging from the Gu=
lf
of Mexico to offshore of the Southeast. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation were raised across the coastal Southeast, given the good
continuity from the GFS model. Please refer to the National Hurricane Cente=
r
for the latest updates and forecasts on Tropical Storm Elsa.

A positively-tilted trough aloft and associated surface front are likely to
enhance diurnal convection across the eastern third of the CONUS where abov=
e
normal precipitation is favored. The elevated probabilities of above normal
precipitation extend southwest to the southern Great Plains and Rio Grande
Valley, based on good agreement and continuity among the precipitation tool=
s.
The amplified 500-hPa ridge aloft favors below normal precipitation across
much
of the West and the Northern and Central Great Plains. Model guidance is in
good agreement for increased probabilities of above normal precipitation
across
parts of Arizona and New Mexico. This is related to enhanced low-level
moisture, associated with easterly waves and increasing monsoonal flow.

Forecast confidence remains high across Alaska as a high amplitude 500-hPa
trough favors below normal temperatures and above normal precipitation for =
a
majority of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
reasonably good agreement on a highly amplified summer pattern offset sligh=
tly
by uncertainty on the eventual track of Tropical Storm Elsa.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 09 - 15 2021

Model solutions depict the high amplitude trough over Alaska shifting sligh=
tly
to the east during week-2, while an expansive and strong 500-hPa ridge for
July
persists over the west-central CONUS. The subtropical ridge is forecast to
slightly strengthen over the eastern and central CONUS with 500-hPa heights
slightly above average. As represented by the large probabilities, forecast
confidence remains high for above normal temperatures across much of the We=
st
and Northern Great Plains. Low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile)
throughout much of the western and north-central CONUS is also likely to
contribute to the anomalous warmth. Elevated probabilities of above normal
temperatures extend east to include the Midwest and Northeast, but
temperatures
are unlikely to be as anomalous as areas to the west. A favored area for be=
low
normal temperatures was reintroduced to parts of the Southeast where soil
moisture is above the 80th percentile, and also based on the consolidation
tool
which weighs the cooler GEFS reforecast more.

Ensemble means are in good agreement that the 500-hPa ridge axis becomes
centered over the Four Corners region early in week-2, which is favorable f=
or
enhanced monsoonal flow into the Southwest. Therefore, above normal
precipitation is favored for parts of Arizona and New Mexico. The expansive
and
strong ridge aloft supports increased probabilities of below normal
precipitation throughout the remainder of the West and north-central CONUS.
Subtropical ridging, both aloft and at the surface, is forecast to strength=
en
and extend westward over the Gulf of Mexico during week-2. This evolving
pattern favors a suppression of seabreeze convection and below normal
precipitation across the Florida Peninsula and along parts of the Gulf Coas=
t.
Also, anomalous upper-level convergence associated with the Madden Julian
Oscillation is forecast to shift east to the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean S=
ea
by week-2. Early in week-2, model guidance features a slow-moving front whi=
ch
elevates probabilities of above normal precipitation across the Midwest,
Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic.

A stable longwave pattern featuring a high amplitude ridge (trough) over th=
e
north-central Pacific (Mainland Alaska) is forecast to persist into mid-Jul=
y.
Therefore, below normal temperatures are likely to continue across much of
Alaska. The troughing aloft favors above normal precipitation for the Alask=
a
Panhandle and much of Mainland Alaska. As the trough axis shifts eastward,
below normal precipitation becomes more probable for the Aleutians and part=
s
of
southwest Mainland Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
stable longwave pattern offset by increasing uncertainty in the precipitati=
on
outlook across the south-central and eastern CONUS.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Threat of heavy rain lingers near the Gulf Coast into next week
as Tropical Storm Elsa could impact Florida by midweek...

...Overview...

The large scale pattern is expected to become less amplified and
more typically summer-like during the medium range period as the
upper trough over the northeastern U.S. lifts into the Canadian
Maritimes early in the week. A seasonably strong upper ridge is
forecast over the Four Corners states, while a weak upper
trough/low may move across the south-central CONUS and help cause
continued rain chances, while the main jet stream/westerlies
meander over the northern U.S. and southern Canada. Additionally,
what is now Tropical Storm Elsa has the potential to impact
Florida around midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

In terms of the overall midlatitude pattern, guidance is pretty
agreeable with the pattern described above. A mainly deterministic
model blend was able to be used especially for the first part of
the forecast period. The 00Z CMC was removed by around midweek as
it had a stronger upper low in the Eastern Pacific offshore of the
Pacific Northwest with a different evolution compared to other
models. There were some fairly minor differences with shortwaves
in the northern stream, which were handled by transitioning to a
blend favoring more of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

However, with Tropical Storm Elsa, guidance is quite variable in
terms of its track and strength. The 00Z ECMWF as well as most of
its ensemble members take a weaker Elsa fairly far east of Florida
into the western Atlantic. Meanwhile, the 00Z/06Z GFS take a
stronger Elsa into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, impacting the
western Florida peninsula, while GEFS members vary quite a bit on
their low tracks. The 00Z CMC appeared in between, and the 00Z
UKMET clustered fairly well with the GFS runs, but the 12Z UKMET
opens Elsa into an open wave by around Monday. Thus, uncertainty
is rather high with Elsa, and its track and strength uncertainties
feed on each other, as a stronger system could influence its
environment more and push westward compared to a weaker system
drifting/turning northeastward. The WPC forecast followed the NHC
track, which was closer to the GFS runs and the 00Z UKMET.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With an initial weakening front in the Southeast, and lowering
heights over the south-central U.S., there will be support for
persistent showers and thunderstorms in the Gulf Coast states next
week. The heaviest rain may be across portions of Texas, with
multi-inch totals likely to accumulate over a few days. Farther
west, some late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are
likely each day over the Central/Southern Rockies through the
medium range period. Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead
of a front from the north-central to northeastern U.S. And, heavy
rainfall and flooding will be a threat where Elsa ends up
tracking, along with high winds near its track. Current forecasts
show heavy rain for portions of the Florida Peninsula and across
the Georgia and Carolina coast around Wednesday into Thursday with
Elsa.

The historic heat wave will continue to lessen in magnitude by the
medium range period as the ridging weakens, but temperatures
nearing and exceeding 100 degrees (depending partially on
elevation) remain expected for the Great Basin and Northern
Rockies through much of next week. Some rain showers over the
northern Rockies may offer slight relief to the heat but they will
do little to ease the growing drought over much of the West. The
north-central U.S. can also expect a hot day on the 4th of July
before a cold front brings temperatures down toward normal on
Monday into Tuesday. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S. through the week
with the cloudiness and showers. Meanwhile, a cooler than average
July 4th is forecast for the Northeast, but temperatures warm into
the 90s by Tuesday.

Hcuty3J1IAs$

FOR FRIDAY JULY 09 - THURSDAY JULY 15: There is little change to the week-2
hazards perspective as dynamical models continue to advertise the weakening=
 of
an amplified 500-hPa ridge towards the end of week-1, followed by the
redevelopment of anomalous ridging overspreading the western and north-cent=
ral
CONUS to increase the potential for above-normal temperatures and possible
excessive heat during the early to middle portion of week-2. The ridge is
anticipated to weaken after the middle of the period, which is seen in
decreasing probabilities of maximum temperatures reaching excessive heat
criteria in the reforecast tool, which would allow for a moderation of
temperatures by mid-July.



The GEFS reforecast tool has increased the signal for heat across the West
today, compared to yesterday, coming into more agreement with the ECMWF
reforecast tool.  The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean shows the mid-level ridge
extending
further east to the Northeast and generally being more amplified than the 0=
Z
ECMWF, which is reflected in the GEFS reforecast tool indicating the potent=
ial
for excessive heat to include parts of the Midwest and Northeast throughout
week-2. Due to these significant model differences, the slight risk (>20%
chance) for excessive heat is limited to the western CONUS and the
north-central CONUS during week-2, where both reforecast tools have agreeme=
nt.
Both the reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance of temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F (90 Deg F in higher elevation
areas)
across the West, whereas only the GEFS reforecast tool shows this elevated
potential across the Dakotas and Upper Mississippi Valley. Despite these
differences, a broad area of moderate risk for excessive heat is posted acr=
oss
parts of the West extending into parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Jul=
y 9
to 12. The moderate risk area has been slightly expanded eastward and
southward
given the better agreement of the heat signal in both reforecast tools for
these regions. Triple digit temperatures are possible across some parts of =
the
higher elevations across the West as well as in parts of the Northern Plain=
s,
where combined with below normal precipitation predominately favored during
week-2, is likely to exacerbate ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D=
4)
conditions being felt throughout this part of the country. Heat-driven impa=
cts
expected also include locally elevated fire weather conditions as well as
direct health risks for human and animal populations across the highlighted
regions.



For precipitation, the Weather Prediction Center's day 7 surface analysis
features surface troughing across the Great Plains, with a frontal boundary
draped across the northeastern CONUS, likely extending into week-2. Both th=
e
GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to favor return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico,
which would advect ample moisture into parts of the eastern CONUS. While th=
e
GEFS reforecast tool remains fairly weak regarding the potential for heavy
precipitation, the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts a region focused over the
Ohio
Valley and Tennessee Valley with at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch early in the perio=
d.
Surface troughing across the Great Plains may support episodes of high wind=
s
across the region during the 8 to 12 day period. The ECWMF reforecast tool
shows at least 20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th
percentile and 20 mph. Due to the GEFS reforecast tool not showing this
signal,
and the ECWMF reforecast tool wind speeds not exceeding 25 mph, a related h=
igh
wind hazard is not posted at this time.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to monito=
r
Tropical Storm Elsa, located at approximately 52W over the tropical Atlanti=
c,
as of 2pm EDT. The NHC 5 day outlook favors Elsa approaching Florida by nex=
t
Tuesday. The last several runs of the deterministic GFS as well as the ECMW=
F
probabilistic tropical cyclone activity guidance generally favors this stor=
m
tracking near the East Coast from the end of week-1 into the beginning of
week-2 after moving across Florida, although there are differences regardin=
g
the details of the track. If this disturbance does track near the East Coas=
t,
there could be increased chances for heavy rainfall across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, as well as high winds along the East Coast.
Despite
general uncertainty at this lead regarding the storm track and resulting
hazardous impacts, a broad area for slight risk of heavy rainfall is
highlighted across parts of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Appalachians,
Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Tennessee Valley, at the beginning of the peri=
od,
based on where the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of
3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th percentile. The heavy precipitation
risk
area includes possible heavy rainfall resulting from the aforementioned
frontal
activating across northeastern CONUS, in addition to possible impacts from
Tropical Storm Elsa during week-2. Heavy rainfall and high winds associated
with Elsa would most likely occur from the end of week-1 (day 7) into day 8
(Jul 8 to 9).



Over the southwestern CONUS, model guidance continues to support the North
American Monsoon kicking into gear. Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor
mid-level ridging (594 dm) centered over the western portion of the Four
Corners region conducive for the enhancement of monsoonal moisture across
parts
of the Southwest. Model guidance tools show slightly greater spatial covera=
ge
for above normal precipitation in the region compared to yesterday. A possi=
ble
flood risk area is designated for eastern Arizona and western New Mexico wh=
ere
the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance for 3-day rainfall
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 0.5 inches. Although totals
are
not expected to exceed pre-defined heavy precipitation hazard thresholds,
there
is a continued risk of locally heavy, convective rainfall over very dry soi=
ls
to elevate the potential for enhanced runoff across the higher elevations i=
nto
the valleys, and a possible flooding hazard is issued across parts of Arizo=
na
and New Mexico.



Over Alaska, anomalous mid-level troughing continues to be favored over muc=
h
of
Alaska, likely bringing below-normal temperatures and above-normal, but non
hazardous precipitation throughout much of the state. The anomalously cool =
and
wet conditions during early July are also likely to quell ongoing wildfire
activity.

0240 PM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm area was expanded westward to account
for the latest high-resolution guidance showing sparse to isolated
thunderstorm coverage across portions of far northeast California.
While coverage may not exceed 10 percent, fuels across parts of
northern California are Critically dry, with very efficient
lightning-induced ignition rates recently reported, hence the
isolated dry thunderstorm delineation expansion. Otherwise, locally
dry and breezy conditions are expected from the lee of the Cascades
to portions of far western North Dakota tomorrow, though the lack of
widespread, stronger surface winds precludes Elevated highlights at
this time.

..Squitieri.. 07/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Thu Jul 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
An indistinct mid-level flow pattern driven by mid-level ridging
will continue across the western US, while a deepening upper low
becomes quasi stationary over the Northeast. At the surface, a cold
front will move south across the center of the country, enhancing
shower and thunderstorm activity while high pressure settles over
the Midwest.

...Northwest and Intermountain West...
With plentiful moisture over much of the western CONUS, scattered
thunderstorms are again forecast to develop diurnally. Lightning
strikes will be possible over areas with dry and receptive fuels.
Similar to the last several days, higher PWAT values across the
Southwest will likely limit the potential for dry strikes, though a
few may still occur outside the heaviest precipitation cores. To the
north along the gradient of the monsoonal surge across the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies, model soundings indicate much drier
low-level thermodynamic profiles favorable for isolated dry strikes.
Several days of lightning activity and dry/receptive fuels will
continue to pose a risk for lightning ignitions. Dry thunder
probabilities have been added where the greatest overlap in storm
coverage and dry surface conditions is forecast.

...Northern Rockies and High Plains...
Gusty easterly flow may linger across portions of Montana
Day2/Friday, as surface pressure gradients begin to weaken with the
passage of the mid-level ridge. Surface humidity values of 20-30%
and winds of 10-15 mph may support a few hours of locally elevated
fire weather conditions given dry fuels.

...Excessive heat continues across interior sections of the
Northwest, the Northern Rockies, and the Northern High Plains...

...Thunderstorms, heavy rain, and flood chances continue ahead of
a cold front moving across the eastern U.S....

...Heavy rain and thunderstorms likely throughout the Central and
Southern Plains and the Desert Southwest....

An upper-level ridge remains in place across the western U.S. as
the excessive heat continues for the interior Northwest, Northern
Rockies, and Northern High Plains. Daily highs well above normal
are expected through the end of the forecast period, with highs at
or above 100 for the interior valleys and Northern High Plains and
in the 90s at higher elevations. While these highs are not as hot
as the historic temperatures seen earlier this week, the
oppressiveness of the heat is compounded by the length of the heat
wave. Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect for portions of
eastern Washington and Oregon, northern Idaho, the Snake River
Valley of Idaho, northwestern Montana, and the high plains of
eastern Montana. Heat Advisories remain in effect or the Northern
Rockies of Montana as well as portions of southern Oregon and
northern California.

In the East, a cold front is progressing southward through the
interior Northeast, central Appalachians, and the Ohio Valley. The
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather
through this evening for the eastern Mid-Atlantic for the threat
of high winds. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is also in
effect from the Mid-Atlantic west through the central Appalachians
and eastern Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. Rainfall totals between
2-4 inches are possible through Friday morning. The heavy rainfall
and flood chances will continue Friday and Saturday as the front
progresses southeastward. There is a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall in effect for eastern North Carolina for the risk of
flash flooding as storms may have rainfall rates of 1-2 inches per
hour. A Marginal Risk continues southwestward through the
Southeast ahead of the front for additional more isolated
instances of heavy rain. By Saturday, the front approaches the
Gulf Coast and heavy rain is once again forecast, with a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall in effect for potential rainfall totals
of 1-2 inches.

Further west along the front, there will be daily thunderstorm and
heavy rain chances for the Central and Southern Plains as the cold
front continues southward and becomes stationary along the High
Plains. There is a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall stretching
from western Oklahoma northwest into the central High Plains where
rainfall totals over an inch are likely through Friday morning,
with locally higher amounts of 2-3 inches possible. A Marginal
Risk is in effect for Friday for the Southern High Plains as
continued instances of heavy rainfall remain possible with storms
along the stationary front. Additionally, a moist airmass in place
over the Desert Southwest through the end of the period will lead
to the threat of heavy rain with any daily rain showers or
thunderstorms. Marginal Risks are in effect for both Friday and
Saturday with hourly rainfall rates of 1-2 inches are possible
with any downpours, leading to flash flooding concerns.

heavy rain is once again forecast, with a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall in effect for potential rainfall totals of 1-2
inches. Behind the front, much cooler weather is expected than
earlier this week, with highs only in the 60s in New England and
the 70s to low 80s throughout the rest of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic.

Further west along the front, there will be daily thunderstorm and
heavy rain chances in the Central and Southern Plains as the cold
front continues southward and becomes stationary along the High
Plains. There is a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall stretching
from western Oklahoma northwest into the Central High Plains where
rainfall totals over an inch are likely through Friday morning,
with locally higher amounts of 2-3 inches possible. A Marginal
Risk is in effect for Friday for the Southern High Plains as
continued instances of heavy rainfall remain possible with storms
along and ahead of the stationary front. Additionally, a moist
airmass in place over the Southern Rockies and Desert Southwest
through the end of the period will lead to the threat of heavy
rain with any daily showers or thunderstorms. Marginal Risks for
excessive rainfall are in effect for both Friday and Saturday with
hourly rainfall rates of 1-2 inches possible with any downpours,
leading to flash flooding concerns. As in the Northeast, cooler
weather behind the front and daily storm chances along and ahead
of the front will keep temperatures more comfortable for this time
of year, with daily highs generally in the 80s outside of the
Desert Southwest.

...Threat of heavy rain for Florida and the Southeast Coast early
to middle next week as Tropical Storm Elsa potentially impacts the
region...

...Threat of repeating heavy rain over southern Texas as low
pressure persists through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as a strong upper
ridge sets up over the Desert Southwest to the Four Corners
states, a weak upper trough/low develops over Texas move across
the south-central CONUS, while the main jet stream/westerlies
meander over the northern U.S. and southern Canada. Additionally,
Tropical Storm Elsa has the potential to cross Florida and move up
Southeast Coast early to midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance is pretty agreeable with the overall pattern (with the
main exception for the track/timing/strength of Elsa) through
midweek. A deterministic general model blend was able to be used
for Monday and Tuesday. The 12Z CMC was removed by late Tuesday as
it had a stronger upper low in the Eastern Pacific offshore of the
Pacific Northwest with a stronger trough over the south-central
CONUS resulting in a stronger and faster Elsa. There were some
minor differences with northern stream shortwave troughs, which
were muted a bit by transitioning to a blend favoring more of the
agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means later next week.

Guidance is quite variable in terms of the track and strength of
Elsa. The 12Z ECMWF continues to weaken the system by Hispaniola.
Meanwhile, the 18Z/00Z GFS take a stronger Elsa into the eastern
Gulf of Mexico before crossing the Florida peninsula and moving up
the Southeast Coast. Run-to-run timing differences are noted with
the 00Z run now slower than the 18Z. The 12Z and 00Z CMC remain
the fastest solution with a stronger system through Florida like
the GFS - the 00Z CMC has shifted farther east than the 12Z. The
00Z UKMET remains similar to the GFS, with the system entering the
eastern Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday, but the UKMET continues to
weaken the system before making any US landfall. Thus, uncertainty
remains rather high with Elsa though a decent heavy rain threat is
present for Florida and possibly the Southeast Coast. The WPC QPF
forecast followed the NHC track, which remains closer to the
recent GFS and UKMET.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next work week with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Periods of rain are forecast along and
ahead of a front from the north-central to northeastern CONUS.
Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds are potential threats
where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of Else have considerable
uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain threat for portions of the
Florida Peninsula Tuesday and across the Georgia and Carolina
coast Wednesday with Elsa.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers, restrengthens with max temperature
anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the Northwest with
some daily record high temperatures mostly in the Great Basin.
Temperatures will generally be a few degrees cooler than average
in the south-central U.S./Texas through the week with cloudiness
and rain from the persistent upper level disturbance there.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad, weak anticyclonic mid-level flow will persist across the West
on Saturday, as mid-level high attempts to develop across the Four
Corners area. A belt of stronger westerly flow will develop across
the US-Canada border of the Pacific Northwest in response to an
increasing height gradient between the ridge across the West and a
series of small short-wave troughs moving across southwest Canada.

... Interior Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will once again be possible
across much of the interior portions of the western United States on
Saturday as strong diurnal heating continues to combine with a
relatively moist airmass. Given the relatively moist airmass,
thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than dry, with the most likely
area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be across portions of Oregon
east into western Montana. Despite several days of isolated
thunderstorms, here the combination of slightly lower precipitable
water values, warmer/drier afternoon conditions, and faster
mid-level flow than on Friday will yield another day of at least
isolated dry thunderstorm potential. Elsewhere, dry, receptive fuels
will pose at least some risk for lightning-induced fire starts,
especially with lightning strikes occurring outside precipitation
cores.

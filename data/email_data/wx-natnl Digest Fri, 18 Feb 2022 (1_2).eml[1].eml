Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CST Thu Feb 17 2022

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN TEXAS...

The Elevated and Critical areas over parts of southern TX were
expanded east-northeastward, where current surface observations show
breezy/gusty northwesterly winds and RH in the lower 20s under clear
skies. Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains on track (see
below).

..Weinman.. 02/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1223 AM CST Thu Feb 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will be more limited spatially compared to
previous days, but are still expected to develop across the Rio
Grande Valley of south TX as well as coastal southern CA. Elsewhere,
ongoing precipitation and/or cold temperatures will limit fire
weather concerns for the rest of the CONUS.

...Rio Grande Valley...
The upper-level trough and attendant Pacific cold front currently
moving into the southern Plains will quickly translate east through
the day. In its wake, dry and breezy conditions are expected to
overspread central and southern TX ahead of a southward surging
polar front. While most locations across central TX will see rain
chances with the passing front, south-central TX will likely remain
dry and maintain ERC values in the 80th-90th percentile. West to
northwesterly winds will increase to 15-20 mph across the region
with frequent gusts between 20-25 mph likely as boundary-layer
mixing increases through the afternoon. Ensemble guidance continues
to show reasonably high probabilities for RH values between 15-25%
across the region, which should support elevated to critical fire
weather conditions. The duration of this threat may be dependent on
how quickly an approaching polar front reaches the area. While model
consensus is that this front will reach the Rio Grande by around
00z, the observed southward progression has been faster than most
solutions, suggesting an earlier arrival time. Regardless, a shift
from northwest to northerly winds is expected with the frontal
passage.

...Coastal Southern California...
Recent observations show the LAX-TPH and LAX-DAG pressure gradients
slowly strengthening over the past few hours. This trend is expected
to continue as surface high pressure builds over the Great Basin.
North to northeasterly mid-level winds are forecast to increase
early this morning as well, resulting in 30-50 mph offshore flow
through the higher terrain of coastal southern CA. Most solutions
agree that the LAX-DAG pressure gradient will peak at around -3 to
-5 mb this morning before gradually weakening this
afternoon/evening. Downslope warming/drying will support areas of RH
reductions into the teens and elevated to critical fire weather
conditions appear probable. However, latest CoCoRaHS reports show
many locations have received wetting rainfall over the past 24
hours, which has limited fuel readiness to a degree and mitigates a
more robust fire weather concern.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes are needed at
this time. A narrow corridor of locally elevated conditions still
appear possible across parts of southwest NE into northwest KS
during the afternoon hours. However, increasing cloud coverage from
the northwest will generally temper any substantial RH reductions
where the stronger west-northwesterly surface winds will develop
(over central NE and northward) -- precluding Elevated highlights at
this time.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CST Thu Feb 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain low across the CONUS for Friday.
Widespread precipitation is expected to overspread parts of the
southern Plains into the MS River Valley and East Coast over the
next 48 hours. Additionally, a polar air mass will remain entrenched
across the north-central U.S., with surface high pressure building
across the inter-mountain West. These factors will largely limit the
fire weather potential. One region worth monitoring is southwest NE
into northwest KS where 15-20 mph winds may coincide with 25% RH
within a modest downslope flow regime. However, confidence in such
conditions is low and ongoing light snowfall may moisten fine fuels.

...Increasing confidence in a southern U.S. heavy rainfall event
with northern tier heavy snows...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00z/06z cycle, model guidance continues to show very
good agreement with the large scale pattern into the middle of
next week, though with some lingering uncertainty in the smaller
scale details. A compact upper low likely west of Baja California
to begin the period Sunday should weaken as it moves eastward,
with good consensus as well on the large scale for energy to spill
into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge by next
Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly eastward.
00z/06z models showed somewhat better agreement on Western trough
timing, with the 00z ECMWF adjusting westward with its axis, more
in line with the GFS. However, the 12z ECMWF again slowed down a
little bit with the axis, while the 12z CMC is faster than its
previous run. So, questions on timing continue to loom late
period. Additionally, the evolution of upstream energy is rather
uncertain stemming from high latitudes and rounding the Pacific
ridge, leading to low confidence in the specifics of the embedded
energies within the main trough and its eventual movement,
especially by day 7. The past few runs of the GFS has been quite
sharp and fast with the next shortwave into the Pacific Northwest
next Thursday, but the 12z run looks more reasonable and in line
with the ECMWF/CMC.

The WPC blend for todays progs featured a multi deterministic
model solution for days 3-5 amidst above average agreement. For
days 6 and 7, the ensemble means were phased into the blend with
increasing proportions to help account for the uncertainties in
the Western U.S. trough timing and mitigate the smaller scale
details. The resulting solution provides a middle ground solution
for the trough and maintains good continuity with the overnight
WPC package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and moderate to heavy mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies and persisting there into the middle
of next week. As the western trough deepens, it should tap into
Gulf of Mexico moisture to fuel a heavy to possibly excessive
rainfall event from portions of the lower Mississippi Valley into
the Tennessee Valley during the early to middle part of next week.
A multi-day event over roughly the same areas is possible as
additional energy gets reloaded into the trough out West. This
likely increases the threat for flooding and flash flooding into
at least next Wednesday. SPC continues to mention the threat for
severe weather within this pattern as well across parts of the
South. On the north side of this system, confidence is increasing
that a swath of moderate to heavy snowfall will be present
stretching from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday and Tuesday, and eventually affecting parts of far
northern New England as well, though the exact axis of heavy snows
remains somewhat uncertain.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30-40 degrees below
normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday
and Tuesday, with cold temperatures lingering through Wednesday
and Thursday as well.

...Increasing confidence in a southern U.S. heavy rainfall event
with northern tier heavy snows...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00z/06z cycle, model guidance continues to show very
good agreement with the large scale pattern into the middle of
next week, though with some lingering uncertainty in the smaller
scale details. A compact upper low likely west of Baja California
to begin the period Sunday should weaken as it moves eastward,
with good consensus as well on the large scale for energy to spill
into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge by next
Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly eastward.
00z/06z models showed somewhat better agreement on Western trough
timing, with the 00z ECMWF adjusting westward with its axis, more
in line with the GFS. However, the 12z ECMWF again slowed down a
little bit with the axis, while the 12z CMC is faster than its
previous run. So, questions on timing continue to loom late
period. Additionally, the evolution of upstream energy is rather
uncertain stemming from high latitudes and rounding the Pacific
ridge, leading to low confidence in the specifics of the embedded
energies within the main trough and its eventual movement,
especially by day 7. The past few runs of the GFS has been quite
sharp and fast with the next shortwave into the Pacific Northwest
next Thursday, but the 12z run looks more reasonable and in line
with the ECMWF/CMC.

The WPC blend for todays progs featured a multi deterministic
model solution for days 3-5 amidst above average agreement. For
days 6 and 7, the ensemble means were phased into the blend with
increasing proportions to help account for the uncertainties in
the Western U.S. trough timing and mitigate the smaller scale
details. The resulting solution provides a middle ground solution
for the trough and maintains good continuity with the overnight
WPC package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and moderate to heavy mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies and persisting there into the middle
of next week. As the western trough deepens, it should tap into
Gulf of Mexico moisture to fuel a heavy to possibly excessive
rainfall event from portions of the lower Mississippi Valley into
the Tennessee Valley during the early to middle part of next week.
A multi-day event over roughly the same areas is possible as
additional energy gets reloaded into the trough out West. This
likely increases the threat for flooding and flash flooding into
at least next Wednesday. SPC continues to mention the threat for
severe weather within this pattern as well across parts of the
South. On the north side of this system, confidence is increasing
that a swath of moderate to heavy snowfall will be present
stretching from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday and Tuesday, and eventually affecting parts of far
northern New England as well, though the exact axis of heavy snows
remains somewhat uncertain.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30-40 degrees below
normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday
and Tuesday, with cold temperatures lingering through Wednesday
and Thursday as well.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 17 2022

SYNOPSIS: There continues to be good agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, an=
d
Canadian ensemble means indicating amplified mid-level low pressure across =
the
western half of the lower 48, continuing from the end of week-1 into the
beginning of week-2. The mid-level pattern is expected to gradually deampli=
fy
and shift northeastward with time, but the models are not in particularly g=
ood
agreement on the resulting pattern across the contiguous 48 states. Of
greatest
hazard concern is the widespread potential for much below normal temperatur=
es
across many parts of the western two-thirds of the contiguous U.S., extendi=
ng
into the Great Lakes region. Increased pattern uncertainty by the middle of
the
period translates to significant uncertainty regarding the enhanced potenti=
al
for much below normal temperatures shifting eastward across the lower 48 af=
ter
the middle of week-2, but the reforecast tools agree on increasing chances =
for
much below normal temperatures across the northern Great Plains, Upper
Midwest,
and Great Lakes Region until late in the period. A storm is predicted to fo=
rm
over the Bering Sea by the beginning of week-2, which may bring unsettled
weather to parts of Alaska, although no related hazards are anticipated at
this
time.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across most of the Plains,
Fri,
Feb 25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the Upper Mississippi
Valley and most locations from the Plains to the Pacific Coast, Fri-Sat, Fe=
b
25-26.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the central an=
d
eastern U.S., Sun-Thu, Feb 27-Mar 3.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY FEBRUARY 20 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 24:

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 25 - THURSDAY MARCH 03: There is good multi-model
depiction
of amplified mid-level troughing across the western half of the CONUS
continuing from the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2, gradually
weakening and shifting eastward with time. This pattern increases the
likelihood for much below normal temperatures across much of the western tw=
o
thirds of the CONUS at the beginning of the period. The slight risk of much
below normal temperatures early in the period is similar to yesterday=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
depiction, and remains for days 8 and 9 (Fri-Sat Feb 25-26). The GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools do not agree as well as they did yesterday. For day 8 (Feb
25), the European ensemble reforecast tool has lower chances for much below
normal temperatures, and is farther west and weaker than the GEFS reforecas=
t
solution, which highlights much below normal temperatures settling further
east, centered on the Great Plains. The GEFS reforecast is favored because =
it
is more consistent with yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs tools, and fi=
ts the expected synoptic
pattern better (a building, almost blocking mid-level ridge building in
western
North America would be more likely to deliver cold air east of the Rockies,
especially given the deamplifying, more progressive pattern developing over
the
CONUS. Therefore, week-2 is expected to start with unseasonably cold air
entrenched across the Nation=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs midsection. The GE=
FS reforecast tools show a
large area with chances exceeding 60 percent that minimum temperatures will=
 be
below the 15th percentile climatology. Where such chances exceed 40 percent=
 on
the GEFS reforecast tool, a moderate chance for much below normal temperatu=
res
has been posted. The hazards stops short of the Rio Grande River in Deep So=
uth
Texas, where there is little chance for temperatures to drop below freezing=
.
It
reaches as far north as the central Dakotas. There, the 15th percentile is
around 5 deg. F, but odds for subzero temperatures are in the 30 to 50 perc=
ent
range. Farther north, the 15th percentile reaches -10 deg. F near the Canad=
ian
Border, and minimum temperatures that low are unlikely. The European ensemb=
le
reforecast tool shows lesser chances for much below normal temperatures, an=
d
covers most areas from the Rockies to the Pacific Ocean; however, a slight
risk
for much below normal temperatures extends over much of this region, as the
GEFS reforecast tool shows slightly enhanced chances for much below normal
temperatures there.



Models increasingly diverge regarding the details of the mid-level pattern
during the middle of week-2. The European ensemble mean keeps higher 500-hP=
a
heights over the southern tier of states - especially in the Southwest - th=
an
the GEFS. This seems driven by its inconsistent handling of the ridge off t=
he
Pacific Coast and into western North America. Yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs 12z run showed a
significantly positively-tilted trough extending farther southwest into the
Four Corners region, with a positive height anomaly centered near northeast=
ern
Alaska. The ensuing 0z European ensemble mean placed a second positive heig=
ht
anomaly center off the West Coast of the CONUS, which raises heights over t=
he
southwestern CONUS. The GEFS mean is more consistent over the last several
runs, keeping a single positive 500-hPa height anomaly near northeastern
Alaska
which keeps heights in the Four Corners Region near or just slightly above
normal at the end of the period.



In either case, unseasonably cold air would push farther east into the Grea=
t
Lakes Region, Ohio Valley, and Northeast. The GEFS reforecast is more bulli=
sh
on much below normal temperatures in this region than the European ensemble
reforecast. Based on the persistent, high amplitude ridge over Alaska throu=
gh
late week-2 and the GEFS reforecast tool, a slight risk of much below norma=
l
temperatures is posted for much of the east-central CONUS from Feb 27 to Ma=
r
3.



There is good agreement in the models regarding possible storm formation ov=
er
the Bering Sea at the beginning of week-2. This could bring windy condition=
s
to
portions of the western Aleutians. However, the reforecast tools and recent
deterministic guidance does not support the inclusion of a related high win=
d
hazard at this time. A warming trend is likely throughout Alaska, beginning
prior to week-2, with above normal temperatures favored to continue into th=
e
beginning of March. On Feb 25 and 26, the GEFS reforecast tool depicts that
maximum temperatures have more than a 40 percent chance of exceeding the 85=
th
percentile of the climatological distribution across much of Mainland Alask=
a.

...Heavy snow and a treacherous icy wintry mix expected from the
Great Lakes to northern New England...

...Severe weather to track through the Mid-South and Tennessee
Valley this evening; flash flooding is possible throughout much of
the Ohio Valley and Interior Northeast...

...An approaching clipper system may produce blizzard conditions
on Friday in parts of the North Central U.S., colder in the
Northeast but warming up in the Great Plains...

A multitude of weather hazards is expected to continue to impact
the Southern Plains through the Northeast as a deepening
low-pressure system and accompanying cold front sweeps across the
eastern half of the country through Friday morning. A large
temperature gradient will help fuel the development and
continuation of precipitation along the surface boundary, with
mixed precipitation and snow occurring in the cold sector of the
system, north of the boundary, and the threat of heavy rains and
severe thunderstorms ahead of the advancing cold front.

As the system continues to strengthen, warm, moist air will be
advected from the Gulf of Mexico, allowing for the development of
severe thunderstorms that can produce damaging winds, large hail,
and isolated strong tornadoes. Because of this, the Storm
Prediction Center (SPC) has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of
severe thunderstorms across the Tennessee and lower Mississippi
Valleys. As the frontal boundary moves eastward on Thursday so
will its threat of severe weather.  While the risk for severe
thunderstorms should wane in the overnight hours, residents
outside of the Enhanced Risk should continue to monitor current
conditions and all products issued by their local forecast office
in preparation for any changes to the going forecast. Further
north, the threat for heavy rain exists for a broad area
stretching from the middle Mississippi Valley, northeastward
through the Ohio Valley and interior Northeast, where the Weather
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall.
Portions of Kentucky, Missouri, and Illinois may experience
rainfall rates greater than 1"/hr, with locally higher amounts,
due to convective activity associated with the cold front moving
through the region. While rainfall rates are not forecasted to be
as excessive in the Great Lakes and Interior Northeast, prolonged
rainfall in conjunction with lingering snowpack and frozen grounds
may lead to flooding in isolated areas. As a consequence of this,
Flood Watches have been issued for much of the region through
Friday morning. Another potential hazard ahead of the storm system
is the strong southerly winds that will impact much of the
Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and New England. Winds could gust as high
as 55-65 mph in isolated areas through Friday morning, leading to
High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories being issued for a large
portion of the eastern region.

In the cold sector of this system, the potential for mixed
precipitation and snow exists across a narrow stripe stretching
from northern Missouri eastward through the Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys and interior Northeast. Areas north of the frontal
boundary including the south-side of Chicago and Detroit, where
cold, arctic air has filtered in, have the highest potential for
seeing accumulations greater than 4". Isolated areas along this
swath of snow may receive 6-10" where the heaviest bands persist.
To the south of the axis of heaviest accumulations, there is
forecasted to be a region of freezing rain and sleet, where
temperature profiles will not be cold enough to support snow. Due
to the broad region expected to be impacted by wintry
precipitation, Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories
have been issued along a nearly 1,500 mile stretch from western
Oklahoma to northern Maine. Residents currently under one of these
products are reminded that traveling during periods of snow,
sleet, or freezing rain is potentially dangerous and to exercise
extreme caution if travel is necessary.

The potent storm system and associated hazards are expected to
clear the eastern region during the early Friday hours, with
colder air spilling in behind it. Farther west, a clipper system
entering the Northern Plains will spread the potential for light
snow into parts of North Dakota and northern Minnesota. While snow
fall accumulations are expected to be light, whipping wind gusts
behind the clipper will cause near whiteout conditions in parts of
eastern North Dakota and northwest Minnesota. This has prompted
the issuance of Blizzard Warnings that are in effect through much
of the day on Friday. Snow showers and snow squalls are then
expected to enter the Great Lakes region and parts of the Midwest
late Friday and into Friday night. This clipper system ushers in
another shot of below normal temperatures into the Ohio Valley and
the Northeast, but it is a short lived period of colder conditions
as the next surge of springlike warmth rebounds in the Great
Plains Saturday and eventually reaches the Ohio Valley by Sunday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 17 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 23 - 27 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in very good agreemen=
t in depicting an amplified
500-hPa mid-level flow pattern across the forecast domain during the next 6=
 to
10 days. A full-latitude ridge and associated above-normal 500-hPa heights =
are
predicted across the Northeast Pacific, extending northward across Alaska,
where the largest positive mid-level height anomalies are favored. An
enhanced,
positively-tilted trough is predicted downstream over much of the western h=
alf
of the CONUS, extending to the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, leading t=
o
below-normal 500-hPa heights. Mean mid-level ridging is forecast for all of
the
southeastern and much of the eastern CONUS, leading to predicted above-norm=
al
heights for many locations.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for Alaska, associated with an amplif=
ied
500-hPa ridge and above-normal 500-hPa heights. Enhanced probabilities of
below-normal temperatures are favored across the western two-thirds of the
CONUS, extending northeastward to Great Lakes and interior Northeast, benea=
th
an amplified, positively-tilted mean mid-level trough. Enhanced odds of
above-normal temperatures are indicated for parts of the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic, due to predicted return flow to the west of a mean subtropica=
l
ridge over the Atlantic.

The potential for several storm systems tracking ahead of a mean trough
centered over the western Bering Sea and Kamchatka Peninsula favors
above-normal precipitation probabilities across southwestern Alaska, and
encompassing a large portion of the Mainland. The predicted ridge over the
Northeast Pacific favors increased odds of below-normal precipitation acros=
s
the western CONUS and parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest.
Downstream, surface low pressure is predicted to develop early in the perio=
d
across the Four Corners, increasing odds of above-normal precipitation. Thi=
s
feature is favored to intensify over the Southern Plains as it moves
east-northeastward along a mean frontal boundary over the Southeast, enhanc=
ing
odds of above-normal precipitation from the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Below-normal
precipitation is favored across the Florida Peninsula, ahead of the
aforementioned mean frontal boundary over the Southeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions and =
forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 25 - MAR 03, 2022

The 500-hPa trough over the CONUS during week-2 is an eastward progression
from
the 6-10 day period. A trough-ridge pattern is depicted across the North
Pacific, favoring below-normal mid-level heights across much of the Aleutia=
ns
and above-normal mid-level heights across the remainder of Alaska. Downstre=
am,
positive mid-level height anomalies are favored across much of the West, on
the
eastern periphery of the mean ridge over the Northeast Pacific. Strong mean
troughing is predicted across the east-central CONUS, but is displaced
northward relative to the 6-10 day period, favoring negative 500-hPa height
anomalies from the Northern Plains to the Northeast. Positive mid-level hei=
ght
anomalies over the Southern Tier are associated with a mean subtropical rid=
ge
over the western Atlantic.

Enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities are favored for all of Alas=
ka,
associated with mean southerly flow. Odds tilt toward above-normal
temperatures
in parts of California, associated with increasing mid-level heights during
week-2 as the mid-level ridge over the Northeast Pacific shifts eastward.
Below-normal temperatures probabilities are enhanced across much of the CON=
US,
as surface high pressure is predicted to dominate through much of the perio=
d.
Ahead of a mean frontal boundary over the Southeast, above-normal temperatu=
res
are predicted across much of the Florida Panhandle.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of southern
and
western Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians, underneath enhanced
southwesterly flow, leading to elevated probabilities of above-normal
precipitation. Below-normal precipitation is most likely across the western
CONUS along the eastern periphery of a mean ridge over the Northeast Pacifi=
c.
Below-normal precipitation is also favored across much of the central CONUS=
,
associated with predicted mean surface high pressure. Odds tilt toward
above-normal precipitation across parts of Montana, as some upslope surface
flow is expected as high pressure systems drop southward out of Canada. Alo=
ng
the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, near to above-normal precipitation is favored=
,
associated with a strong low pressure system exiting the Eastern Seaboard
early
in the period and a mean frontal boundary remaining across the Southeast in
its
wake for the remainder of the period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation fields i=
n
the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in

...Increasing confidence in a southern U.S. heavy rainfall event
with northern tier heavy snows...


...Overview...

As next week begins, quasi-zonal flow across much of the U.S. will
be transitioning to a more amplified pattern as upper-level energy
spills into the West to create deep troughing, while ridging
builds in the East. The trough will slowly track eastward along
with a strong frontal system, behind which arctic high pressure
should produce well below normal temperatures in the central U.S.,
with warmer than average temperatures in the East. Light to
moderate precipitation is likely in the West underneath the trough
and spreading into the central and eastern U.S., with the
possibility of northern tier snow and southern U.S. rain and
thunderstorms. A multi-day rainy period for parts of the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys could lead to flooding and flash
flooding there.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 00z/06z cycle, model guidance continues to show very
good agreement with the large scale pattern into the middle of
next week, though with some lingering uncertainty in the smaller
scale details. A compact upper low likely west of Baja California
to begin the period Sunday should weaken as it moves eastward,
with good consensus as well on the large scale for energy to spill
into the West east of an amplified eastern Pacific ridge by next
Sunday-Monday, gradually deepening and shifting slowly eastward.
00z/06z models showed somewhat better agreement on Western trough
timing, with the 00z ECMWF adjusting westward with its axis, more
in line with the GFS. However, the 12z ECMWF again slowed down a
little bit with the axis, while the 12z CMC is faster than its
previous run. So, questions on timing continue to loom late
period. Additionally, the evolution of upstream energy is rather
uncertain stemming from high latitudes and rounding the Pacific
ridge, leading to low confidence in the specifics of the embedded
energies within the main trough and its eventual movement,
especially by day 7. The past few runs of the GFS has been quite
sharp and fast with the next shortwave into the Pacific Northwest
next Thursday, but the 12z run looks more reasonable and in line
with the ECMWF/CMC.

The WPC blend for todays progs featured a multi deterministic
model solution for days 3-5 amidst above average agreement. For
days 6 and 7, the ensemble means were phased into the blend with
increasing proportions to help account for the uncertainties in
the Western U.S. trough timing and mitigate the smaller scale
details. The resulting solution provides a middle ground solution
for the trough and maintains good continuity with the overnight
WPC package as well.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Precipitation will be increasing in the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies over the weekend with the upper trough coming in.
Coastal and valley rain and moderate to heavy mountain snow are
likely over the Pacific Northwest spreading into California, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies and persisting there into the middle
of next week. As the western trough deepens, it should tap into
Gulf of Mexico moisture to fuel a heavy to possibly excessive
rainfall event from portions of the lower Mississippi Valley into
the Tennessee Valley during the early to middle part of next week.
A multi-day event over roughly the same areas is possible as
additional energy gets reloaded into the trough out West. This
likely increases the threat for flooding and flash flooding into
at least next Wednesday. SPC continues to mention the threat for
severe weather within this pattern as well across parts of the
South. On the north side of this system, confidence is increasing
that a swath of moderate to heavy snowfall will be present
stretching from the northern Plains into the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes Monday and Tuesday, and eventually affecting parts of far
northern New England as well, though the exact axis of heavy snows
remains somewhat uncertain.

Temperatures as next week begins are expected to be above normal
for parts of the West into the Plains, with the largest anomalies
of highs 20+ degrees above average over Nebraska. As the pattern
amplifies, the south-central U.S. to the East Coast will further
warm through the first half of next week, with widespread highs
10-20F and lows 20-30F above normal. Meanwhile, a cold Arctic high
is forecast to expand across the north-central U.S., leading to
well below average temperatures initially across the northern High
Plains and spreading southward (as far south as Texas) through
midweek. Temperatures in some places could be 30-40 degrees below
normal, and highs in the single digits to even below 0F are
expected for Montana, the Dakotas, and northern Minnesota Monday
and Tuesday, with cold temperatures lingering through Wednesday
and Thursday as well.

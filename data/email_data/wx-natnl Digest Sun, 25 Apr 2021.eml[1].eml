Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 AM CDT Sat Apr 24 2021

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEVADA...FAR NORTHERN
ARIZONA...SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN UTAH...AND FAR SOUTHWEST
COLORADO...

...Southern Nevada and Northwest Arizona...
The Critical fire weather area over portions of southeastern Utah
has been extended westward into southern Nevada and northwest
Arizona. Where, the latest high-resolution ensemble guidance
suggests increasing confidence in sustained surface winds of 20-30
mph (with stronger gusts) overlapping areas with critical RH values
(i.e., < 15%) for several hours this afternoon into this evening.
Meanwhile, large-scale exceptional drought over this area has also
led to ERC values near (or exceeding) the maximum value for this
time of year, suggesting fuels are critically receptive. While
relatively poor overnight RH recoveries are expected, fire weather
conditions should subside this evening through the overnight as
surface winds decrease.

...Edwards Plateau southward to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas...

Downslope northerly winds are forecast to promote hot and dry
surface conditions this afternoon into this evening from far
southern portions of the Edwards Plateau to the Rio Grande Valley.
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected during this time as
sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph overlap critical RH values
(i.e., < 20%) and receptive fuels. Any elevated fire weather
conditions should subside quickly later this evening as winds weaken
and turn easterly increasing low-level moisture.

..Elliott.. 04/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Sat Apr 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level jet,
associated with a leading impulse ahead of a larger upper-level
trough, beginning to nose into the northern California coast.
Stronger mid and upper-level flow associated with this feature is
forecast to continue edging eastward into the southern Great Basin
by this afternoon. This will result in modest surface pressure falls
across the inter-mountain West, as well as position 30-40 mph
boundary-layer flow from southern NV to the UT/CO border, where
ongoing drought and antecedent dry conditions have resulted in
receptive fuels. Regionally critical to more widespread elevated
fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon as a result from
the Great Basin into the Southwest/Southern High Plains.

...Great Basin...
Recent guidance has come into better agreement regarding the
placement of the stronger mid-level flow over the southern
NV/northern Four-Corners region. Although high-level cloud cover is
expected to overspread the region, 30-40 mph winds just above the
surface will not require substantially deep boundary-layer mixing to
transport the stronger flow to the surface. While stronger gusts
will be likely through this broad corridor, the closer proximity of
the UT/CO border region to the stronger surface pressure falls to
the north will favor this region for sustained 20+ mph winds and
persistent critical fire weather conditions (though transient
critical conditions are probable across southern NV). Dewpoints in
the single digits from northern AZ into eastern UT will support
diurnal RH minimums in the single digits to low teens this
afternoon. Slightly higher humidity is likely for locations
west/southwest, but should generally remain between 10-20% and
support elevated to locally critical conditions.

...Southwest/Southern High Plains...
The passage of a weak overnight cold front across TX will limit any
moisture return into the southern High Plains today and maintain RH
values in the teens across the region. Nearly zonal flow over the
central and northern Rockies should allow for at least modest lee
troughing along the central High Plains this afternoon.
South/southwesterly winds across NM should increase to 15-20 mph and
support elevated fire weather conditions. Weaker mid-level winds
will generally limit the potential for 20+ mph winds, but a few
locations may see an hour or two of critical conditions.

...Heavy rain threat from the Southern Plains into the Middle
Mississippi Valley next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Although guidance has differed with important aspects of the
forecast recently, the past day of model/ensemble runs has
provided a dramatic increase of spread for flow details downstream
from a strong ridge that builds into the West mid-late week. This
spread arises from a combination of timing differences for the
upper trough/embedded low forecast to emerge from the
West/southern Rockies as well as various ideas for the timing and
amplitude of northern tier U.S. and southern Canada flow.

The most long-standing issue has been the timing of the initial
western trough/embedded upper low. Recently the UKMET/CMC runs
have tended to be slowest with it, though the 00Z UKMET adjusted
faster toward the typically more progressive GFS/GEFS idea in
spite of the UKMET being closer to the ECMWF cluster for the
strength of the ridge building into the West. The ECMWF/ECMWF mean
had been moderately progressive and phased but not to the degree
of the GFS/GEFS mean. However 00Z runs of the ECMWF/CMC and their
means made a major change in the northern stream, becoming faster
with the shortwave energy so that it amplifies into a northeastern
U.S. trough instead of having any chance to interact with the
southern stream feature. This leaves the southern stream upper low
anywhere between the southern Plains and northwestern Mexico into
late week. Illustrative of the forecast uncertainty, the UKMET
reverted from its 00Z run back to the ECMWF/CMC cluster for the
southwestern low and joins those models in principle for a more
progressive northeastern trough by Friday. The new 12Z ECMWF is
still slow with the southern stream and trended even faster with
the northern stream.

In contrast, models and means are more agreeable in principle for
an eastern Pacific upper trough that should arrive at the West
Coast early in the weekend. There are typical differences with
precise timing and amplitude but these pale in comparison to the
spread seen farther east.

The updated forecast blend incorporated elements from the broad
spectrum of forecast guidance available through the 06Z cycle, as
multi-day trends favored some incorporation of the slower scenario
for the western trough/upper low while the 00Z UKMET provided a
signal at the time that a more phased GFS/GEFS-type solution could
not be fully ruled out. By late in the period this resulted in a
partial trend toward faster frontal progression over the East and
slower waviness hanging back near the Gulf Coast. As expected,
continuity is better over the West although the Pacific front
arriving by Saturday is a bit faster.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system affecting the West early in the week will bring some
lower elevation rain/mountain snow with the best focus over
favored terrain in Arizona through the Rockies of Colorado and
Wyoming on Tuesday. Farther east, interaction of Gulf moisture
with the leading wavy front from the Great Lakes into southern
High Plains will promote increasing coverage and intensity of
rain/thunderstorms from about Tuesday night onward, with heaviest
rainfall expected from portions of Texas and Oklahoma into the
Middle Mississippi Valley. Slow movement of the wavy front for a
time could allow for training of convection. The Storm Prediction
Center continues to monitor the threat for severe weather with
this event as well so check the latest outlooks for further
information. Significant divergence in the guidance for the
pattern east of the Rockies after early Thursday lowers confidence
in the coverage and intensity of precipitation from late week into
the weekend. Emerging trends suggest potential for rainfall to
become progressive as it reaches the East while it lingers for a
longer time over the southern tier and/or southern half of the
Plains.

Flow around the upper ridge building into the West and ahead of
the next shortwave may bring some moisture into the Pacific
Northwest and possibly extreme northern Rockies. Heaviest
precipitation should remain over western British
Columbia/Vancouver island. It is uncertain how far south into the
Northwest any precipitation may reach through midweek or so, but
approach of the late-period shortwave should increase the coverage
over the Northwest and northern Rockies by Saturday.

The warm sector ahead of a wavy front extending from the Plains
into Great Lakes and New England will contain temperatures up to
10-20F above normal from parts of the central Plains into the Ohio
Valley/Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through midweek.
Some or most of New England may remain north of this front and
thus be considerably cooler. Increasing pattern uncertainty over
the East after Thursday leads to low confidence in the temperature
forecast over some areas. Meanwhile locations from the Southwest
and Four Corners into southern High Plains should see a day or so
of cool highs (up to 10-15F below normal) through midweek. The
cooling trend farther east will likely be more modest. Continue to
expect very warm to hot conditions to build over the West after
midweek as a strong upper ridge builds over the region. Expect
highs to reach 10-20F above normal over a majority of the West by
Thursday and/or Friday with some daily record highs and warm lows
possible over the Southwest and possibly other locations. The
upper trough approaching from the eastern Pacific will begin a
cooling trend over northern areas by Saturday, with plus 10-15F
anomalies most likely to extend from parts of California and the
Southwest into the north-central Plains at that time.

...Heavy rain threat from the Southern Plains into the Middle
Mississippi Valley next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Although guidance has differed with important aspects of the
forecast recently, the past day of model/ensemble runs has
provided a dramatic increase of spread for flow details downstream
from a strong ridge that builds into the West mid-late week. This
spread arises from a combination of timing differences for the
upper trough/embedded low forecast to emerge from the
West/southern Rockies as well as various ideas for the timing and
amplitude of northern tier U.S. and southern Canada flow.

The most long-standing issue has been the timing of the initial
western trough/embedded upper low. Recently the UKMET/CMC runs
have tended to be slowest with it, though the 00Z UKMET adjusted
faster toward the typically more progressive GFS/GEFS idea in
spite of the UKMET being closer to the ECMWF cluster for the
strength of the ridge building into the West. The ECMWF/ECMWF mean
had been moderately progressive and phased but not to the degree
of the GFS/GEFS mean. However 00Z runs of the ECMWF/CMC and their
means made a major change in the northern stream, becoming faster
with the shortwave energy so that it amplifies into a northeastern
U.S. trough instead of having any chance to interact with the
southern stream feature. This leaves the southern stream upper low

late week. Illustrative of the forecast uncertainty, the UKMET
reverted from its 00Z run back to the ECMWF/CMC cluster for the
southwestern low and joins those models in principle for a more
progressive northeastern trough by Friday. The new 12Z ECMWF is
still slow with the southern stream and trended even faster with
the northern stream.

In contrast, models and means are more agreeable in principle for
an eastern Pacific upper trough that should arrive at the West
Coast early in the weekend. There are typical differences with
precise timing and amplitude but these pale in comparison to the
spread seen farther east.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat April 24 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Sat Apr 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

Widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected tomorrow
into tomorrow evening across a large portion of the Southwest United
States.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
Primary change with this forecast update was to expand the
Critical/Elevated fire weather area farther northeastward into
portions of Colorado and Kansas, where the latest high-resolution
ensemble guidance suggests several hours of critical conditions
tomorrow afternoon/evening. Guidance may still be underforecasting
the extent of low-level drying across these areas, so confidence
remains low in exactly how far northeast Critical/Elevated fire
weather conditions will spread and these areas may need to be
expanded in future outlooks. Lingering uncertainties also remain
farther south across portions of the Texas Panhandle where recent
precipitation (and some remaining green up) raises questions about
fuel receptiveness amidst meteorologically critical fire weather
conditions. Updates to fuel guidance will be monitored closely and
may lead to refinements in future outlooks.

While surface winds should weaken overnight, lingering breeziness
coupled with poor overnight RH recoveries (near critical RH values)
will likely promote at least elevated fire weather conditions
through the overnight across much of the Southern High Plains.

...Southern Great Basin/Four Corners...
Primary update with this forecast was to extended the
Critical/Elevated fire weather area farther west into portions of
southern Nevada, northwest Arizona, and far southern Utah. While RH
values are forecast to be slightly greater across this region than
farther east, sustained surface wind speeds (and gusts) may also be
greater and should compensate for slightly higher RH values.

Please see previous discussion below for additional information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 04/24/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0202 AM CDT Sat Apr 24 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted across the eastern Pacific in
water-vapor imagery, is forecast to deepen along the West Coast
through the day Sunday as it gradually shifts onshore. As a result,
a belt of stronger mid and upper-level flow will likely reside over
the Great Basin with a deepening surface low positioned across the
northern Rockies. This synoptic pattern will favor increasing winds
across much of the southern Great Basin and greater Four Corners
region. Given ongoing drought conditions, heightened ERC values, and
antecedent dry conditions across this region, heightened fire
weather concerns are likely.

...Southern Great Basin/Four Corners...
Short and medium-range ensemble guidance shows reasonable agreement
in the deepening of a surface low over the MT/ID/WY region through
the day Sunday. Strengthening pressure-gradient winds up to 20-25
mph appear likely from southern NV eastward into NM. Similar to
Saturday, the axis of stronger mid-level flow should reside from
southern NV into eastern UT, which will help support wind gusts
between 30-40 mph, though gusts up to 35 mph will be possible
further east towards the Four Corners. Critical wind speeds appear
most likely across northern NM into the Four-Corners region, but may
extend as far west as northwest AZ where the stronger mid-level flow
will be located. However, cloud cover may limit diurnal heating and
mixing across this region. Minimal rain chances or moisture return
prior to Sunday afternoon supports high probabilities for relative
humidity values below 15%, and dry antecedent conditions will
continue to cure fuels.

...Southern High Plains...
Zonal flow over the northern/central Rockies will support persistent
lee troughing through the day Sunday. In response, southerly flow is
forecast to increase to 15-25 mph across the southern High Plains of
east NM and far west TX. A low-level jet over the region is forecast
to strengthen through the day, and diurnal boundary-layer mixing
should allow for 30-40 mph wind gusts within the low-level jet
corridor. Recent ensemble guidance suggests this will most likely
occur across northeast NM into the western TX/OK Panhandles.
Elevated fire weather conditions may extend further east into far
western OK, but fuel quality/receptiveness decreases with eastward
extent.

quadrant of the U.S. for the next few days...

A low pressure and frontal system across the Southeast and moist
inflow from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to cause
thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast through this evening and
tonight. An Enhanced Risk of severe weather (with tornadoes, wind,
and hail all possible threats) and a Slight Risk of flash flooding
are in place for the Florida Panhandle as well as southern Alabama
and Georgia. By Sunday morning, most thunderstorms will have moved
offshore as the front sweeps across the region and the surface low
deepens over the Atlantic. That low moving northeastward as well
as another frontal system moving eastward from the Great Lakes
region should help create showers across the Mid-Atlantic tonight
and the Northeast on Sunday. Most precipitation should be rain,
but northern New England could see light amounts of snow by early
Monday.

In the West, upper-level troughing with upper-level energy pushing
through, along with a series of fronts moving through the region,
are expected to produce widespread precipitation expanding
southeastward across the Intermountain West on Sunday. By Monday,
light precipitation is possible into the Southwest as
precipitation dies down farther north. In general, higher
elevations of the Intermountain West should see snow, with lower
elevations seeing rain. The Sierra Nevada can expect around a foot
of snow, prompting Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather
Advisories there, with 6 to 18 inches of snow also forecast for
the Wind River Mountains/Tetons over the next couple of days.

The upper trough and fronts coming into the West will also cause
cooler than normal temperatures in that region, especially for
maximum temperatures. Meanwhile, an upper ridge ahead of the
trough will lead to warm temperatures across much of the central
U.S., though cold temperatures are likely in the Northern Plains
and Upper Midwest north of a sharp warm front. Precipitation is
also expected north of that front, and a few inches of snow are
possible in portions of the Dakotas and Minnesota on Sunday, with
a round of northern tier snow and rain on Monday as well.

The Southwest to Southern Plains will continue to see fire danger
threats over the next few days, given dry conditions and gusty
winds. Through this evening, a Critical Risk is outlooked by the
Storm Prediction Center for portions of southern Nevada and Utah
and northern Arizona, with broader Elevated Risks from the Desert
Southwest to Texas. Red Flag Warnings and Wind Advisories are also
in effect. On Sunday, a large Critical Risk is in place for the
Four Corners states into parts of the Texas and Oklahoma
Panhandles. Then by Monday, the cooling and moistening trend in
the Southwest should help reduce the threat in that area, but the
Southern High Plains could still see the potential for fire danger.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0101 AM CDT Sun Apr 25 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS REGION AND THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery shows continued zonal flow over
the northern/central Rockies with a deepening upper-level low off
the Pacific Northwest coast. This low is forecast to gradually
deepen along the West Coast through the day while zonal flow is
maintained over the Rockies. As a result, surface pressure falls are
expected across eastern ID into central/eastern WY.  Surface winds
across the Southwest and High Plains are forecast to strengthen in
response, and will introduce fire weather concerns given dry
antecedent conditions and receptive fuels.

...Great Basin/Four Corners...
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely again today from
southern NV into the Four Corners region. Southwesterly flow off the
desert terrain of southern CA will limit any moisture return into
the region, and recent VWP observations from southern NV and
southern UT show 30-40 mph winds within the lowest 2-3 km. These
winds will remain in place as an mid-level jet develops over the
region. Despite some high-level cloud cover, diurnal heating will
help these stronger winds mix down by mid to late afternoon. This
will also support RH reductions into the low teens for most of the
region. Overall, similar wind/RH conditions are expected today as
compared to Saturday, but the coverage of 20+ mph surface winds will
likely be more widespread given the stronger pressure falls and
better upper-level wind support.

...Southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather conditions appear likely for much of NM into
the western Panhandles region. A lee trough, noted in recent surface
pressure analyses, will continue to deepen and support widespread 20
mph winds across the central and southern High Plains this
afternoon. Recent observations from the KAMA, KDDC, and KGLD VWPs
show a strong nocturnal jet in place over the region with 50-70 mph
winds just above the surface. Although this jet is expected to
weaken through the day, diurnal boundary-layer mixing will
facilitate downward transport of the stronger winds aloft and
support widespread wind gusts into the 30-40 mph range. Despite
modest moisture return into the region early this morning,
southwesterly flow off the southern Rockies will drive downslope
warming and drying to yield RH values in the single digits to low
teens from central NM into the Panhandles. Fuels across the southern
High Plains are undergoing green-up with improving fuel moisture
with eastward extent. So while elevated to critical wind/RH
conditions may be fairly widespread, the greatest fire weather risk
will be confined to NM and the far western Panhandles were grassy
fuels are generally drier.

...Heavy rain threat from the Southern Plains into the Middle
Mississippi Valley next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The medium range period (Wed-Sun) features amplified troughing (or
a closed low) which drifts eastward with time from the Four
Corners region, possibly reaching the Southeast/Tennessee Valley
or East Coast by the end of the weekend. Upstream, strong ridging
will build across the Western U.S. the first half of the period
before it also gets kicked eastward by additional shortwave energy
reaching the West Coast day 6-7.

The largest forecast concern continues to be evolution and timing
of the initial western troughing as it moves through the Southern
Plains and points east. Although guidance has always struggled
some with the timing of this feature, the past day of
model/ensemble runs has provided a dramatic increase in spread.
This arises from a combination of timing differences for the upper
trough/embedded low, as well as various ideas for
timing/amplitude/interaction with northern stream flow. Both the
ECMWF/CMC have made the biggest shifts in the past day or so with
a faster progression of northern stream energy across the northern
tier into the Northeastern U.S., which leaves the southern stream
trough/embedded upper low hanging back and lingering in the
vicinity of the Southern Plains (with slow eastern movement) for
several days. The ECMWF does eventually kick the energy eastward
(more so than the CMC) but is still not nearly as fast at the GFS.
The GFS (and off and on runs of the UKMET) support more phasing
between the northern/southern stream energy resulting in a much
faster progression of the trough, bringing it into the Eastern
U.S. by next weekend.

Although there has been a clear trend in all of the guidance for
slower movement, prefer to land somewhere in the middle of the two
extremes as this point (close to the ensemble means). WPC favored
a quick transition to majority ensemble mean guidance by mid to
late period, although with about a third contribution from the
ECMWF for trough definition (which obviously gets washed out in
the ensembles) and because the ECMWF is the deterministic piece of
guidance closest to that of the ensemble means. This approach
provides fairly good continuity with the previous WPC forecast and
also works well for more agreeable Western U.S. troughing entering
the picture by the last half of the period.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Interaction of Gulf moisture with the leading wavy front from the
Great Lakes into southern High Plains will promote increasing
coverage and intensity of rain/thunderstorms from just before the
medium range period begins and onward, with heaviest rainfall
expected from portions of Texas and Oklahoma into the Middle
Mississippi Valley. Slow movement of the wavy front for a time
could allow for training of convection and an increased flood
risk. Dependent on trough evolution, there could be some threat
for severe weather as well (see the Storm Prediction Center for
additional details). Significant divergence in the guidance for
the pattern east of the Rockies after early Thursday lowers
confidence in the coverage and intensity of precipitation from
late week into the weekend. Emerging trends suggest potential for
rainfall to become progressive as it reaches the East while it
lingers for a longer time over the southern tier and/or southern
half of the Plains.

Flow around the upper ridge building into the West and ahead of
the next shortwave may bring some moisture into the Pacific
Northwest and possibly extreme northern Rockies. Heaviest
precipitation should remain over western British
Columbia/Vancouver island. It is uncertain how far south into the
Northwest any precipitation may reach through midweek or so, but
approach of the late-period shortwave should increase the coverage
over the Northwest and northern Rockies by Saturday.

The warm sector ahead of the main front extending from the Plains
into Great Lakes and New England will contain temperatures up to
10-20F above normal from mainly parts of the Tennessee Valley into
the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast through midweek. Temperatures should
moderate back closer to normal after Thursday for the East, but
increasing pattern uncertainty over the East leads to low
confidence in the temperature forecast over some areas. Meanwhile,
continue to expect very warm to hot conditions to build over the
West after midweek as a strong upper ridge builds over the region.
Daily highs may reach 10-20F above normal over a majority of the
West by Thursday and/or Friday with some daily record highs and
warm lows possible over the Southwest and possibly other
locations. The upper trough approaching from the eastern Pacific
will begin a cooling trend over northern areas by Saturday, with
plus 10-15F anomalies most likely to extend from parts of
California and the Southwest into the north-central Plains at that
time.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently noted off the coast of the Pacific
Northwest, is forecast to deepen and shift east/southeast into the
Southwest through Monday. As this occurs, a surface lee trough will
consolidate into a low over eastern CO by Monday afternoon.
Strengthening mid and upper-level flow will begin to overspread the
NM/TX region and support the potential for strong winds. Given
antecedent dry conditions, this will introduce widespread critical
fire weather concerns to the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities for
widespread 20+ mph surface winds across NM and into adjacent regions
of TX, OK, CO, and KS as winds increase in response to the deepening
surface low. Southwesterly downslope winds and strong diurnal
heating will help mix a dryline east into the eastern OK/TX
Panhandles and allow for widespread relative humidity values in the
single digits to low teens. Strong mid-level flow within a deep,
well-mixed boundary layer should allow for widespread wind gusts
between 30-40 mph. Widespread critical wind/RH conditions will
likely be met across the broader southern High Plains region;
however, spring green-up may limit the spatial extent of receptive
fuels. Fuels will be most favorable across NM and into the far
western Panhandles, but will become less receptive with eastern and
northern extent. An expansion of both the elevated and critical risk
areas may be needed if fuel guidance trends drier across the eastern
OK/TX Panhandles and western KS.

...Central High Plains...
West to southwest downslope winds off the central Rockies are
expected to overspread eastern WY and into western NE Monday
afternoon. Sustained winds between 20-25 mph appear probable, and
more aggressive guidance suggests RH reductions to 15-20% are
possible. Consequently, elevated to critical fire weather conditions
may develop by the late afternoon hours. However, ERC values near
the 50th percentile and 10-hour fuel moisture values between 5-10%
suggests fuels may not be as receptive as compared to locations
further south. As mentioned in the southern High Plains section, a
risk area may be introduced in subsequent updates pending fuel
trends.

...Northeast...
The latest fuel guidance indicates that fine fuels across portions
of the northeast are receptive with ERC values near or above the
90th percentile and 10-hour fuel moisture near 5%. Dry and breezy
conditions are possible on Monday afternoon in the wake of a
departing surface low to the east. Relative humidity values in the
25-35% range may coincide with 10-15 mph winds across central PA and
into eastern NY. However, this region is also receiving wetting
rainfall early Sunday morning, which may mitigate any fuel
readiness. Trends will continue to be monitored given the prior
state of the fuels and the potential for elevated wind/RH conditions
on Monday.

...Light rain to continue over the Northeast through Monday
morning...

...Rain and snow are likely across much of the West through
Monday...

...Fire danger is expected to continue in the southwestern
quadrant of the
U.S. for the next few days...

Low pressure just off the Northeast Coast and a front extending
from the Lower Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley will produce light
rain across the Northeast that will slowly end on Monday.  Light
snow will also develop across the higher elevations of the
Northeast overnight Sunday that will gradually taper off by Monday
evening.

In the meantime, a warm front over the Northern/Central Plains
will move eastward and lift northward into the Upper Great Lakes
by Tuesday.  The boundary will aid in producing rain and snow over
parts of the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday
morning, moving into the Upper Great Lakes overnight Sunday. The
rain and snow will change over to all rain over the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes on Monday, continuing into
Tuesday morning.

Furthermore, a deep upper-level trough just off the Northwest
Coast will move onshore on Sunday, moving to the Great Basin by
Tuesday.   The energy will aid in producing rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest eastward into the
Northern High Plains and extending southward to parts of

...Significant winter storm to impact parts of the northern
Rockies and northern Plains with heavy snow and blizzard
conditions beginning tonight...

...Severe thunderstorms expected over the Great Plains today and
from the Upper Midwest to the southern Plains on Saturday along
with the potential for scattered instances of flash flooding...

...Damaging wind gusts and very dangerous wildfire-spread
conditions are forecast throughout the central/southern High
Plains and southern Rockies today...

A powerful and dynamic April storm system is expected to impact
the central U.S. today and produce a plethora of weather hazards
stretching the entire length of the Great Plains. The catalyst for
this system is a potent negatively tilted upper-level trough that
is currently entering the West Coast and expected to rapidly
strengthen into a closed upper-level low over the northern High
Plains on Saturday. At the surface, an area of low pressure is
forecast to develop and strengthen over the High Plains near far
western Nebraska by this evening. Meanwhile, precipitation will
blossom to the north and west of the low pressure center tonight,
which will help draw much colder air from the mid-levels down to
surface. A quick changeover from rain to snow will commence across
parts of northeast Wyoming and eastern Montana into Sunday
morning, with heavy snow expanding into the western Dakotas by
Saturday afternoon. Gusty winds as high as 75 mph will combine
with heavy snowfall rates to create low visibilities and blizzard
conditions. Travel will be very difficult to impossible at times,
with power outages and tree damage also expected. Total snowfall
amounts by the time the storm exits on Sunday are forecast to
exceed 1 foot across northeast Wyoming, eastern Montana, western
North Dakota, and northwest South Dakota. Parts of the higher
terrain of the northern/central Rockies, extending into southwest
Montana, western Wyoming, Utah, and western Colorado could also
see snowfall totals over a foot.

On the warm side of the system, a dry line and approaching Pacific
cold front will be the trigger for developing thunderstorms
throughout the Great Plains late this afternoon. Several storms
could turn severe and produce damaging wind gusts, large hail, and
tornadoes. The greatest chances for severe weather today extends
from central Nebraska through western Kansas into the Oklahoma and
Texas panhandles. It is this region where the Storm Prediction
Center has highlighted an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe
thunderstorms. As the cold front progresses eastward on Saturday,
the severe weather threat will shift into the Upper Midwest and
stretch southwestward into the southern Plains. SPC has issued a
Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather from Minnesota to
central Oklahoma for the start of the weekend. Heavy rain is also
a potential hazard to contend with as thunderstorms develop and
lead to scattered instances of flash flooding. A Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall is in effect today for parts of
the Midwest and northern Plains. Showers and thunderstorms along a
warm front could contain intense rainfall rates beginning this
morning from central Iowa to northern Illinois. Additionally,
heavy rain over a melting snowpack could lead to flooding concerns
over central/eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota. By
Sunday, as the cold front reaches the Middle Mississippi Valley,
several rounds of slow-moving thunderstorms are possible from
central Texas to southern Illinois. Widespread rainfall amounts
over 2 inches are forecast and could lead to the threat of flash
flooding, which has prompted a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall
to be issued for the region.

Throughout the central/southern High Plains and southern Rockies
there is a threat of extreme fire weather today. This area will be
located on the dry side of the aforementioned dry line and
experience a combination of high winds and very low relative
humidity. As a result, any existing wildfires could spread
uncontrollably and new wildfires could be easily started. More
specially, the Colorado Front Range into east-central New Mexico
is under the greatest risk today. Red Flag Warnings are in effect
from Nebraska to southern Arizona. Besides increasing the fire
weather threat, high winds could be particularly dangerous from
the central Plains to eastern Arizona as gusts approach 70 mph.
Potential impacts include damage to power lines and blow down
trees, as well as treacherous travel conditions for high profile
vehicles. High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have been issued.

Lastly, warm temperatures will be located throughout much of the
central and eastern parts of the country into the start of the
weekend as southerly winds flow ahead of the major central U.S.
storm system. Highs into the 80s are expected to reach the Ohio
Valley on Saturday and Mid-Atlantic by Sunday. Conversely, below
average and cooler temperatures should remain across much of New
England and Intermountain West through the short term, with well
below average temperatures rightfully found where snow is forecast
across the northern Plains.

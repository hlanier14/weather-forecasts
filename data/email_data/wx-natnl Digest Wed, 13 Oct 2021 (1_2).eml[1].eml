Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1200 PM CDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

Expanded the West Texas elevated area slightly farther north and
east based on the afternoon dryline location from morning guidance.
Otherwise, no changes were made.

..Bentley.. 10/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CDT Tue Oct 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid/upper-level low is forecast to move from the Southwest
this morning into portions of the central/northern High Plains by
late tonight, as a surface cyclone initially near the Four Corners
region redevelops across portions of the central High Plains this
afternoon/evening.

...Central and southern High Plains...
Elevated to potentially critical meteorological conditions are
expected this afternoon across parts of the central/southern High
Plains, behind the dryline that will extend southward from the
aforementioned surface cyclone. The greatest relative fire-weather
risk is expected over portions of east-central and southeast CO,
where sustained winds of greater than 25 mph (with higher gusts) and
minimum RH values of 15-20% are expected. Confidence in a sufficient
coverage and duration of critically low RH precludes an upgrade at
this time. Very isolated dry thunderstorms cannot be ruled out
across this region as well.

Elevated wind/RH conditions are also expected southward into
portions of eastern NM and west TX. Fuels are generally less
receptive in this area compared to areas further north, but the
separate elevated area has been maintained from southeast NM into
far west TX, where fuels are likely somewhat drier compared to areas
of the TX Panhandle and South Plains, where somewhat greater
antecedent rainfall has been observed.

...California...
Somewhat lighter winds are expected today across much of CA compared
to Monday, as the surface low near the Four Corners redevelops
eastward, resulting in a weaker surface pressure gradient. However,
several hours of elevated to near critical conditions are still
expected across parts of northern/central CA into coastal regions of
southern CA, as sustained winds remain in the 15-20 mph range (with
higher gusts) and RH values drop below 15%.

SYNOPSIS: An area of strong mid-level low pressure forecast over western No=
rth
America is likely to promote onshore flow and above-normal precipitation fo=
r
the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. There are elevated chances for heavy,
and
possibly record-breaking precipitation amounts for this time of year over
portions of central and northern California during week-2. Mid-level high
pressure forecast downstream is likely to lead to mild temperatures and dri=
er
than normal conditions across much of the central and eastern CONUS. In
Alaska,
below normal temperatures remain favored over much of the Mainland, however
minimum nighttime temperatures are not expected to reach hazard thresholds.

FOR WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 20 - TUESDAY OCTOBER 26: A highly amplified 500-hPa m=
ean
height pattern continues to be favored by the dynamical models, with full
latitude troughing and atmospheric river activity being the focus for
hazardous
weather concerns across the western CONUS during week-2. The latest mean
week-2
mid-level height departures from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles shows this
mid-level feature has become amplified relative to yesterday's guidance, wh=
ich
now depict mean height falls in excess of 210 dam centered over the
northeastern Pacific, and a broader coverage of negative height anomalies o=
ver
the western CONUS. The Canadian ensemble has become more of an outlier,
favoring a weaker and more westward mean solution of the mid-level troughin=
g
over the northeastern Pacific. Downstream, there is good agreement among th=
e
models featuring amplified ridging centered over the Hudson Bay with positi=
ve
height departures overspreading much of the north-central CONUS. This is
expected to promote mild, unseasonably warm weather and curb hazard potenti=
al
for many areas east of the Rockies during week-2.



Tied to the amplified troughing aloft, deterministic solutions show storm
system activity over the northeastern Pacific bringing periods of above-nor=
mal
precipitation across the West Coast. There is agreement in the reforecast
tools
indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile and 1 inch extending from the Pacific Northwest to the southern
half
of California throughout the entire period. Although chances for 3-day
precipitation amounts exceeding 2 inches are sparse in the reforecast tools
over the Pacific Northwest, there is a substantial increase in raw daily me=
an
precipitation amounts among the ensembles, as well as probabilities in the =
raw
ECMWF ensemble for meeting this threshold over Oregon and Washington compar=
ed
to yesterday. Thus, this supports the northward expansion of a slight risk =
of
heavy precipitation of the Pacific Northwest for week-2. Similar to yesterd=
ay,
higher probabilities (>40%) remain focused from central California to south=
ern
Oregon in both reforecast tools, where the ECMWF continues to be quite robu=
st
with this heavy precipitation potential, depicting probabilities in excess =
of
60% (40%) of 3-day amounts exceeding the 85th (98th) and 2 inches through t=
he
middle of period, suggestive of possible near record breaking precipitation
for
late October. Thus, a high risk of heavy precipitation remains posted in th=
e
outlook from approximately the San Francisco Bay area to Redding, Californi=
a,
with a broader moderate risk area extending from southern Oregon to the
southern Central Valley for Oct 20 to 24.



While the elevated risk for heavy precipitation may trigger localized flood=
ing
over burn scarred areas of the state, the increase in moisture is anticipat=
ed
to quell ongoing wildfire activity, help improve drought conditions, curren=
tly
ranging from D0 to D4 across Oregon and California, and replenish water
resources throughout the West Coast. According to the California Data Excha=
nge
Center (CDEC), many reservoir levels across the central and northern portio=
n
of
the State remain less than 50% of the historical average. High elevation he=
avy
snow is possible in the Sierra Nevadas and Cascades during the period, thou=
gh
temperatures are not expected to be markedly colder than normal, precluding
the
addition of any snow related hazards across the West. Additionally, reforec=
ast
tools also depict increased chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th
percentile tied to the enhanced onshore flow and possible atmospheric river
activity. Thus, a slight risk of high winds is issued for the entirety of
week-2.



East of the Rockies, frontal activity tied to surface low pressure developm=
ent
favored across southern Canada is likely to result in cold air advection
across
the Plains, Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes early in the period. While a
drop in minimum temperatures is likely, reforecast tools are unsupportive o=
f
nighttime lows reaching hazard criteria, and no corresponding temperature
hazards are posted. In the southern Plains, forecast surface troughing
interacting with the aforementioned frontal boundary is likely to bring
increased amounts of precipitation across portions of Texas and Oklahoma. T=
his
is reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools highlighting an ar=
ea
in the Southern Plains with at least a 20% chance of 3-day totals exceeding
the
85th percentile. However, these totals appear rather tenuous among the
ensembles, precluding a precipitation related hazard. If anything, the
increase
in precipitation would help benefit moisture starved soils in Texas and
Oklahoma where D0 to D2 drought conditions are observed.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to eye a
tropical wave in the Caribbean. This disturbance has a low chance of format=
ion
over the next five days and is not expected to bring any impacts to the CON=
US
as it is forecast to drift east. Tropical activity looks to be quiet across
the
Atlantic during the next two weeks, however there may be an uptick in activ=
ity
later in October and early November should the enhanced phase of the
Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagate eastward and maintain an organize=
d
structure while destructively interfering with the emerging La Nina base st=
ate
across the Pacific. For more information, please refer to our Global Tropic=
s
and Benefits Outlook released later today
(https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/=
CWlink/ghazards/index.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pVsKSWPgOSlFjB7O1ov4A4s6Q2i7Gx-F3qaTjb=
9j0RjqGWavm3noaT8RyL4IndUUbjzBVq4e$ ).



Over Alaska, the aforementioned mid-level troughing is expected to bring
below-normal temperatures across the southwestern Mainland and the Aleutian=
s,
with above-normal precipitation favored across the Southeast and Panhandle.
The
ECMWF reforecast tool continues to favor elevated chances (>40%) of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile mainly across the western
Mainland whereas the GEFS keeps these higher probabilities mostly offshore.
Given these disparities in the reforecast guidance, and where negative
temperature anomalies do not approach hazard thresholds in the raw ensemble
means, no temperature related hazards are posted for the state.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 PM EDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that the amplified western
trough/eastern ridge upper pattern in the short range will become
flatter and more progressive heading into the weekend and the
start of next week. This will support moderating and in some cases
more variable temperatures over much of the lower 48 along with a
drier trend over the central/eastern U.S. The two main
precipitation areas will be over the East with a wavy front late
this week and over the Pacific Northwest with a system supported
by a vigorous shortwave trough arriving into western North America
by Sunday. An upper trough amplifying over the eastern Pacific
early next week should start to build a ridge over the western
U.S. by next Tuesday, possibly leading to a gradual deceleration
of that West Coast trough (eventually with a possible embedded
low) as it reaches the northern Plains/Upper Midwest into southern
Canada at that time.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance differences are not terribly large for the early
part of the medium range period, as the upper trough that is
becoming more progressive pushes a cold front with waves of low
pressure along it across the east-central U.S. Friday into
Saturday. While there remain some mainly latitudinal differences
with the placement of those surface lows, this 00Z/06Z model cycle
came into better agreement with a surface low position near the
Lower Great Lakes for 12Z Saturday, with a slight northward trend
in the EC runs. Newer 12Z guidance does continue to show some
spread in the exact position of this low. But overall, was able to
use a deterministic model blend early in the medium range period,
as the model consensus appeared a reasonable compromise.

Farther upstream, models generally agree with the potent shortwave
energy moving into the Pacific Northwest around Sunday, but there
are some differences in the amplitude of the associated upper
trough, with the 00Z CMC having the deepest solution, which
becomes slower and more out of phase by Monday/Tuesday as it drops
a low into the West. Teleconnections relative to the negative
height anomaly corresponding to the East Pacific trough late in
the period favor the model/mean majority that has a ridge, not the
00Z CMC trough/low--though there may be a weak southern stream
feature that tracks into the Southwest. Meanwhile the 00Z UKMET
was shallower with the Pacific Northwest trough, but the 00Z/06Z
GFS and 00Z ECMWF line up well with the timing and depth of the
feature through early next week. As this energy tracks eastward
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada, model
differences remain with if/when/where a low closes off, its center
point, and if/how it connects to the northern stream. Used a blend
of the 06Z GFS and GEFS mean and slightly higher weighting on the
00Z ECMWF and EC ensemble mean for the latter part of the period,
which maintained good continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The southern Plains/Midwest frontal wave expected to strengthen as
it tracks northeastward into Canada from early Friday onward
should produce an axis of moderate to heavy rainfall from near the
Lower Ohio Valley into parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast. To some
degree the rain may be enhanced by moisture originating from
eastern Pacific Hurricane Pamela. The 00Z model runs still vary
some for the details of the frontal wave but at least are getting
closer together than they were previously. Expect lighter rainfall
to extend southward along the trailing cold front. Most of the
East will be dry after Saturday aside from lingering rain over the
eastern Great Lakes/northern New England and the Florida
Peninsula. Precipitation is forecast to increase over the northern
Pacific Northwest beginning Friday and lasting into the weekend as
an upper trough and developing surface system approach.
Precipitation could trend toward dry conditions early next week as
an upper ridge builds over the West.

Chilly temperatures in the West should continue into Friday, with
lows 10-20F below normal and highs 10-25F below normal primarily
centered over and near the Rockies. Less extreme anomalies will
extend into the Plains. Western temperatures will continue the
warming trend during the weekend. The north-central Rockies may
stay moderately below normal into early next week while the
Northwest through northern Plains could see temperatures vary with
system progression. Warmth over the East will continue
Friday-Saturday with many areas seeing highs 10-15F or so above
normal and morning lows 10-20F/locally 20-25F above normal. A
broad area of record warm lows is possible from the Lower
Mississippi Valley northeastward and there may also be a few
record highs over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The front
crossing the region will erode the warmth from west to east as its
passage should bring near to slightly below normal highs for
Sunday-Tuesday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 18 - 22 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast ove=
r
Alaska extending southward into the northeastern Pacific off the west coast=
 of
the CONUS. Strong mean ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over parts of the Aleutians and much of the west-central CONUS,
while
a weak trough is forecast over the eastern CONUS in the 6-10 day period. Du=

to
recent model performance, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa =
height blend forecast gives
equal weight to the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means and less weight to the

temperatures are favored over the remainder of the CONUS associated with
ridging and near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal temperature
probabilities are elevated over most of Alaska under predicted troughing an=

below normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted troughing over the northeastern Pacific increases the chances of
above normal precipitation across most of the West Coast of the CONUS. Ridg=

and near to above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of near to below
normal precipitation for much of the remainder of the CONUS, except for par=

of the Southern Plains and Southeast, where above normal precipitation is
favored due to forecast frontal activity. Troughing and associated surface =

pressure increase the odds of above normal precipitation over parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Below normal
precipitation is favored for southwestern Alaska, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 20 - 26 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is similar to the 6-10 day mean

north-central CONUS during week 2, with a weakness in the subtropical ridge
predicted across much of the Gulf Coast.

Below normal temperatures continue to be favored over most of Alaska, under
troughing and negative 500-hPa height anomalies. With mean troughing expect=

near the West Coast, near to below normal temperatures are favored most of
California. Near to above normal temperatures are likely for the remainder =

near to below normal precipitation for much of the remainder of the CONUS,
except for part of the Southern Plains and Southeast where above normal
precipitation is favored due to predicted frontal activity. Troughing and

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Tue Oct 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer cyclone is forecast to move from the central High
Plains Wednesday morning toward southern Manitoba by late Wednesday
night. As this occurs, a shortwave mid/upper-level trough will move
from the Pacific Northwest into portions of the Great Basin,
reinforcing the deep longwave trough over the western CONUS.

...Northern CA...
Some increase in northerly low-level flow is possible across parts
of northern CA late Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night, in the
wake of the reinforcing mid/upper-level shortwave trough moving into
the Great Basin. This scenario would support the potential for
elevated fire-weather conditions. However, at this time, guidance is
not overly strong with northerly flow through the end of the Day 2
period, and any ramp up in winds late Wednesday may occur after some
nocturnal RH recovery, with a greater potential threat into
D3/Thursday. With these factors in mind, no elevated delineation has
been made at this time.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated meteorological conditions are again expected from portions
of eastern NM into the TX Panhandle/South Plains, as low-level
westerly flow remains somewhat enhanced into the afternoon. However,
due to recent rainfall, fuel receptiveness may remain relatively
limited, so no elevated delineation has been made at this time.

...First winter storm of the season to bring heavy snow to the
Northern/Central Rockies today and the northern High Plains
overnight...

...Severe weather and heavy rain will persist in the Central and
Southern Plains through Thursday...

...Mild temperatures continue throughout the eastern US while
frigid highs and sub-freezing lows are expected out West...

A deep low pressure/frontal system moving through the Central
Rockies and into the Northern Plains will serve as the focus for
active weather of all types through the short-range period,
including the first winter storm of the season. With favorable
dynamics and high atmospheric moisture accompanying this ongoing
system, heavy snowfall with additional accumulations up to and in
excess of 12" are expected in the Northern Rockies and High Plains
as well as areas of high elevation in the Central Rockies. Winter
Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories will remain in effect
until late this evening for the Central and Northern Rockies,
while locations farther east in the High Plains will hold on to
these warnings and advisories until midday tomorrow. Strong winds
with gusts up to 60 mph are also expected to accompany this storm
as it moves through the Rockies and into the Central High Plains.
High Wind Warnings are currently in effect for the
Central/Southern Rockies and Central High Plains as these winds
may knock down trees and power lines and blow around already
fallen snow, lowering visibility and making travel hazardous.

Ahead of the cold front on the eastern edge of this system warmer
temperatures, surface instability, and high atmospheric moisture
throughout the Central and Southern Plains will support the
development of showers and thunderstorms capable of becoming
severe. Numerous supercells are expected to form throughout the
day that will have the potential to produce damaging winds, large
hail, and multiple tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Moderate Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for western Kansas,
western Oklahoma, and the northeastern Texas panhandle as these
areas hold the greatest probability of receiving hail 2+" in
diameter and significant tornadoes through tomorrow morning. While
the severe weather threat tapers off on Wednesday, the potential
for widespread flash flooding ramps up as heavy rain focused
around the trailing cold front inundates portions of the Southern
Plains. With strong deep-layer ascent in place and atmospheric
moisture levels well above normal, a swath of 3-6+" rainfall
accumulations is expected across central Texas. These high
accumulations combined with the potential for hourly rainfall
rates of 2-3" in some areas has prompted the Weather Prediction
Center to issue a Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions
of central Texas from Wednesday morning through Thursday morning.
Heavy rainfall will continue in central Texas on Thursday as
moisture from Hurricane Pamela is transported northeast and
interacts with the quasi-stationary boundary draped through the
state, thereby prolonging the risk of flash flooding through
Friday.

Throughout the short-range period a strong temperature contrast
will exist across the country. High pressure locked in place over
the eastern seaboard will allow moderately above normal
temperatures to persist across the eastern US, while the storm
system out west will advect cool air south from higher latitudes,
dropping daily highs 20 to 30 degrees below average into the 30s
and 40s. Freeze Watches and Warnings are currently in effect over
portions of the Southwest and Central Great Basin.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
439 PM EDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that the amplified western
trough/eastern ridge upper pattern in the short range will become
flatter and more progressive heading into the weekend and the
start of next week. This will support moderating and in some cases
more variable temperatures over much of the lower 48 along with a
drier trend over the central/eastern U.S. The two main
precipitation areas will be over the East with a wavy front late
this week and over the Pacific Northwest with a system supported
by a vigorous shortwave trough arriving into western North America
by Sunday. An upper trough amplifying over the eastern Pacific
early next week should start to build a ridge over the western
U.S. by next Tuesday, possibly leading to a gradual deceleration
of that West Coast trough (eventually with a possible embedded
low) as it reaches the northern Plains/Upper Midwest into southern
Canada at that time.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance differences are not terribly large for the early
part of the medium range period, as the upper trough that is
becoming more progressive pushes a cold front with waves of low
pressure along it across the east-central U.S. Friday into
Saturday. While there remain some mainly latitudinal differences
with the placement of those surface lows, this 00Z/06Z model cycle
came into better agreement with a surface low position near the
Lower Great Lakes for 12Z Saturday, with a slight northward trend
in the EC runs. Newer 12Z guidance does continue to show some
spread in the exact position of this low. But overall, was able to
use a deterministic model blend early in the medium range period,
as the model consensus appeared a reasonable compromise.

Farther upstream, models generally agree with the potent shortwave
energy moving into the Pacific Northwest around Sunday, but there
are some differences in the amplitude of the associated upper
trough, with the 00Z CMC having the deepest solution, which
becomes slower and more out of phase by Monday/Tuesday as it drops
a low into the West. Teleconnections relative to the negative
height anomaly corresponding to the East Pacific trough late in
the period favor the model/mean majority that has a ridge, not the
00Z CMC trough/low--though there may be a weak southern stream
feature that tracks into the Southwest. Meanwhile the 00Z UKMET
was shallower with the Pacific Northwest trough, but the 00Z/06Z
GFS and 00Z ECMWF line up well with the timing and depth of the
feature through early next week. As this energy tracks eastward
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada, model
differences remain with if/when/where a low closes off, its center
point, and if/how it connects to the northern stream. Used a blend
of the 06Z GFS and GEFS mean and slightly higher weighting on the
00Z ECMWF and EC ensemble mean for the latter part of the period,
which maintained good continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The southern Plains/Midwest frontal wave expected to strengthen as
it tracks northeastward into Canada from early Friday onward
should produce an axis of moderate to heavy rainfall from near the
Lower Ohio Valley into parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast. To some
degree the rain may be enhanced by moisture originating from
eastern Pacific Hurricane Pamela. The 00Z model runs still vary
some for the details of the frontal wave but at least are getting
closer together than they were previously. Expect lighter rainfall
to extend southward along the trailing cold front. Most of the
East will be dry after Saturday aside from lingering rain over the
eastern Great Lakes/northern New England and the Florida
Peninsula. Precipitation is forecast to increase over the northern
Pacific Northwest beginning Friday and lasting into the weekend as
an upper trough and developing surface system approach.
Precipitation could trend toward dry conditions early next week as
an upper ridge builds over the West.

Chilly temperatures in the West should continue into Friday, with
lows 10-20F below normal and highs 10-25F below normal primarily
centered over and near the Rockies. Less extreme anomalies will
extend into the Plains. Western temperatures will continue the
warming trend during the weekend. The north-central Rockies may
stay moderately below normal into early next week while the
Northwest through northern Plains could see temperatures vary with
system progression. Warmth over the East will continue
Friday-Saturday with many areas seeing highs 10-15F or so above
normal and morning lows 10-20F/locally 20-25F above normal. A
broad area of record warm lows is possible from the Lower
Mississippi Valley northeastward and there may also be a few
record highs over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The front
crossing the region will erode the warmth from west to east as its
passage should bring near to slightly below normal highs for
Sunday-Tuesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
439 PM EDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that the amplified western
trough/eastern ridge upper pattern in the short range will become
flatter and more progressive heading into the weekend and the
start of next week. This will support moderating and in some cases
more variable temperatures over much of the lower 48 along with a
drier trend over the central/eastern U.S. The two main
precipitation areas will be over the East with a wavy front late
this week and over the Pacific Northwest with a system supported
by a vigorous shortwave trough arriving into western North America
by Sunday. An upper trough amplifying over the eastern Pacific
early next week should start to build a ridge over the western
U.S. by next Tuesday, possibly leading to a gradual deceleration
of that West Coast trough (eventually with a possible embedded
low) as it reaches the northern Plains/Upper Midwest into southern
Canada at that time.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance differences are not terribly large for the early
part of the medium range period, as the upper trough that is
becoming more progressive pushes a cold front with waves of low
pressure along it across the east-central U.S. Friday into
Saturday. While there remain some mainly latitudinal differences
with the placement of those surface lows, this 00Z/06Z model cycle
came into better agreement with a surface low position near the
Lower Great Lakes for 12Z Saturday, with a slight northward trend
in the EC runs. Newer 12Z guidance does continue to show some
spread in the exact position of this low. But overall, was able to
use a deterministic model blend early in the medium range period,
as the model consensus appeared a reasonable compromise.

Farther upstream, models generally agree with the potent shortwave
energy moving into the Pacific Northwest around Sunday, but there
are some differences in the amplitude of the associated upper
trough, with the 00Z CMC having the deepest solution, which
becomes slower and more out of phase by Monday/Tuesday as it drops
a low into the West. Teleconnections relative to the negative
height anomaly corresponding to the East Pacific trough late in
the period favor the model/mean majority that has a ridge, not the
00Z CMC trough/low--though there may be a weak southern stream
feature that tracks into the Southwest. Meanwhile the 00Z UKMET
was shallower with the Pacific Northwest trough, but the 00Z/06Z
GFS and 00Z ECMWF line up well with the timing and depth of the
feature through early next week. As this energy tracks eastward
into the north-central U.S. and south-central Canada, model
differences remain with if/when/where a low closes off, its center
point, and if/how it connects to the northern stream. Used a blend
of the 06Z GFS and GEFS mean and slightly higher weighting on the
00Z ECMWF and EC ensemble mean for the latter part of the period,
which maintained good continuity with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The southern Plains/Midwest frontal wave expected to strengthen as
it tracks northeastward into Canada from early Friday onward
should produce an axis of moderate to heavy rainfall from near the
Lower Ohio Valley into parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast. To some
degree the rain may be enhanced by moisture originating from
eastern Pacific Hurricane Pamela. The 00Z model runs still vary
some for the details of the frontal wave but at least are getting
closer together than they were previously. Expect lighter rainfall
to extend southward along the trailing cold front. Most of the
East will be dry after Saturday aside from lingering rain over the
eastern Great Lakes/northern New England and the Florida
Peninsula. Precipitation is forecast to increase over the northern
Pacific Northwest beginning Friday and lasting into the weekend as
an upper trough and developing surface system approach.
Precipitation could trend toward dry conditions early next week as
an upper ridge builds over the West.

Chilly temperatures in the West should continue into Friday, with
lows 10-20F below normal and highs 10-25F below normal primarily
centered over and near the Rockies. Less extreme anomalies will
extend into the Plains. Western temperatures will continue the
warming trend during the weekend. The north-central Rockies may
stay moderately below normal into early next week while the
Northwest through northern Plains could see temperatures vary with
system progression. Warmth over the East will continue
Friday-Saturday with many areas seeing highs 10-15F or so above
normal and morning lows 10-20F/locally 20-25F above normal. A
broad area of record warm lows is possible from the Lower
Mississippi Valley northeastward and there may also be a few
record highs over the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. The front
crossing the region will erode the warmth from west to east as its
passage should bring near to slightly below normal highs for
Sunday-Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 AM CDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow aloft will persist over the central and southern Rockies
as long-wave troughing lingers over the western/central CONUS. Weak
lee troughing across the High Plains coupled with downslope flow
will result in dry westerly winds across the southern High Plains
that will likely support some fire weather potential. Further west,
northwesterly flow through much of California will result in
localized fire weather concerns.

...Southern High Plains...
Westerly post-frontal winds are expected to gradually increase
through the day across much of eastern New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle as a weak lee trough deepens. Sustained winds between 15
to 20 mph are probable, with afternoon gusts up to 25 mph possible.
Despite cooler temperatures, dry air advecting into the region
coupled with mostly clear skies and downslope warming/drying will
result in afternoon RH reductions into the teens for many locations.
Elevated conditions will be possible across a large swath of eastern
NM and the TX Panhandle, however, rainfall over the past 12 hours
has likely mitigated fuel readiness. The current risk area
highlights where favorable overlap of receptive fuels and dry/windy
conditions is most likely.

...Southern California...
Early morning VWP observations across CA show north to northwesterly
winds above the nocturnal inversion. These winds are forecast to
persist and will likely mix to the surface through the day amid a
deepening boundary layer. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph are
possible within the higher terrain, and combined with antecedent dry
conditions, may support localized elevated conditions. Winds are
forecast to increase through the northern Sacramento Valley later
tonight, but diurnal RH improvements will likely result in a only
low-end fire weather concern.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Oct 16 2021 - 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021

...Overview...

Most guidance advertises a fairly progressive upper pattern over
the lower 48 ahead of a mean trough that amplifies over the
eastern Pacific next week. There is reasonable agreement for the
upper trough crossing the eastern states Saturday-Monday and then
a modest trailing ridge. However models and ensembles have become
more divergent over the past day for what ultimately becomes of a
shortwave trough forecast to approach the West Coast by early
Sunday. This issue also affects a weak southern stream shortwave
tracking into the Southwest. Thus there is increasing uncertainty
for some weather details from the West into the Plains from late
Sunday onward. The leading part of the Pacific trough should reach
far enough eastward to have some influence on the West Coast by
next Tuesday or Wednesday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The models persist with some detail differences for a
strengthening wave expected to be near the eastern Great Lakes or
farther north over Canada at the start of the period early
Saturday. A blended approach is reasonable given the fairly subtle
detail differences aloft (low predictability multiple days out in
time) and modest timing differences for the trailing front that
sweeps across the East Coast.

As for the shortwave nearing the West Coast early Sunday, the 12Z
ECMWF and a meaningful number of its ensemble members have joined
recent CMC runs in pulling off energy from the southern part of
the feature to form a closed or nearly closed low that crosses the
West. This scenario contrasts with the prior majority consensus,
still consisting of the GFS/UKMET and recent GEFS/CMC means, which
keeps the trough energy in the northern stream as it progresses
across the northern U.S./southern Canada.  Interestingly, while
the ECMWF had support from some of its ensembles, none of the 12Z
CMC ensemble members reflected the CMC/ECMWF scenario. It is still
a question mark how much energy can separate and track over the
West given the developing mean ridge over the region in response
to the amplifying Pacific trough. At the very least if that does
occur, the resulting feature should be fairly weak/progressive.
The weak southern stream shortwave that may track into the
Southwest would maintain itself as a distinct feature if the
aforementioned trough remained in the northern stream, or else be
incorporated within/ahead of the flow from any feature that pulls
off from the West Coast trough. For the purposes of preparing a
deterministic forecast based on data available through the 12Z/18Z
cycles, preference sided with maintaining the ideas of continuity
until the evidence for a significant change becomes more
compelling.

Farther upstream the 12Z ECMWF strayed a bit on the faster side to
bring leading Pacific height falls into the Northwest by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Again this was within the ensemble spread but
the majority of models/ensembles favored a slower and more
amplified depiction of the trough.

Forecast preferences led to starting with a 12Z/18Z operational
model blend to start the period on Saturday. With time the blend
steadily transitioned toward replacing the 12Z ECMWF with its
prior 00Z run while incorporating some GEFS/ECMWF/CMC means along
with holding onto the GFS. GFS input transitioned to the 12Z run
for about the latter half of the period due to the 18Z run
questionably holding back the upper low near James Bay and merging
it with the system coming across the northern tier.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Portions of the Northeast will likely see moderate to heavy
rainfall on Saturday as strengthening eastern Canada low pressure
pushes a front across the region. Expect rain to be much lighter
to the south.  Some lingering rain may fall to the lee of the
eastern Great Lakes and over favored windward terrain during
Sunday. Otherwise much of the East will see a drier trend aside
from the Florida Peninsula where developing easterly low level
flow may gradually increase rainfall toward midweek. Precipitation
over the Pacific Northwest will extend into the weekend as an
upper trough and developing surface system approach, with heaviest
totals likely to be over the Olympics and far northern Cascades.
Uncertainty with the ultimate evolution of upper trough energy
lowers confidence in the precise southward extent of precipitation
along the West Coast as well as where and how much may fall over
inland portions of the West. Another question mark exists over the
southern High Plains where some rain could develop toward midweek
if southern stream shortwave energy remains separate from the
trough reaching the West Coast during the weekend. Finally, the
West Coast should see another increase of moisture by
Tuesday-Wednesday ahead of a more amplified East Pacific upper
trough.

Areas near the East Coast will start Saturday with lows 10-25F
above normal but the cold front crossing the region will quickly
bring a cooling trend, with Saturday highs only 10-15F above
normal. Moderately below normal highs to the west of the
Appalachians on Saturday will continue eastward Sunday and then
modify toward normal.  Elsewhere most temperature anomalies should
be in the single digits on either side of normal. There may be a
few colder pockets in the Rockies on Saturday while warm flow
ahead of a frontal system crossing the northern tier may produce
some warmer readings over parts of Montana on Sunday and perhaps
into the Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes by Monday-Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0202 AM CDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow is forecast to increase through the day Thursday as the
axis of an upper-level trough shifts over the Rockies. This will
maintain dry westerly downslope winds over the southern High Plains
and support another day of elevated fire weather concerns. To the
west across California, high pressure over the Pacific Northwest
will support northerly flow through the Sacramento Valley that
should result in fire weather concerns.

...Southern High Plains...
Strengthening mid and upper-level flow over the southern Rockies
will support a deepening surface low over the central High Plains as
well as increasing westerly winds within the boundary layer.
Westerly downslope winds around 15-20 mph on the southern periphery
of the low will support RH reductions into the teens and low 20s.
Deepening boundary layers through the day may foster wind gusts
upwards of 25-30 mph by late afternoon. Elevated conditions appear
most likely across southeast NM/southwest TX where fine-fuel
moisture is near or below 5% and sustained 15+ mph winds are most
likely, but elevated conditions may extend as far north as
east-central NM and the western TX Panhandle.

...Northern California...
Surface high pressure building over the southern Pacific Northwest
will induce northerly down-valley flow through the Sacramento Valley
Thursday afternoon. Most guidance suggests winds will most likely be
sustained around 15 mph with locally stronger gusts possible. With
antecedent dry conditions already in place (above-average ERCs and
fine-fuel moisture values between 3-4% are noted in recent analyses)
and RH values in the teens expected, elevated fire weather
conditions appear probable.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
400 AM EDT Wed Oct 13 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 13 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021

...First winter storm of the season spreading heavy snow into the
northern High Plains today along with high winds...

...Severe weather and heavy rain over the central today will taper
off some as they spread into the upper Midwest tonight...

...Moisture drawn northward from Hurricane Pamela will enhance
heavy rain threat across the southern Plains tonight...

The most active weather during the short-range period will be
found today across much of the Great Plains as low pressure system
continues to intensify and reach peak intensity tonight.  As the
intense storm is responsible for the first winter storm of the
season currently in progress across the northern High Plains where
heavy snowfall of an additional a foot is possible near the
adjoining borders of the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Montana along with
very strong and gusty winds.  Winter Storm Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories remain in effect for much of the northern High
Plains.  Strong winds with gusts up to 60 mph are also expected to
accompany this storm as it intensify further while tracking
towards the northern Plains. High Wind Warnings are currently in
effect for a large section of the northern Plains.

In addition to the wintry weather, severe thunderstorms are
expected to sweep across much of the central and southern Plains
today ahead of a vigorous cold front.  By tonight, moisture being
drawn northward from Hurricane Pamela currently about to make
landfall in western Mexico will enhance the threat heavy rain
across the southern Plains as the tropical moisture interacts with
the cold front.  An axis of 2 to 3 inches of rain with locally
higher amounts is forecast to extend from southwestern Texas
towards eastern Oklahoma.  The threat of heavy rain may extend
into Thursday night in portions of these areas as the front is
forecast to become nearly stationary.

Throughout the short-range period a large temperature contrast
will be found across the country.  High pressure locked in place
over the eastern seaboard will allow moderately above normal
temperatures to persist across the eastern US, while the storm
system out west will advect cool air south from higher latitudes,
dropping daily highs 20 to 30 degrees below average into the 30s
and 40s.  Freeze Watches and Warnings are currently in effect over
portions of the Southwest and Central Great Basin.

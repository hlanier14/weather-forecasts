Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1123 AM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Adjustments were made to the dry thunderstorm area based on the
latest guidance. Storm initiation in the eastern portions is quite
uncertain and those areas were removed. PWAT could near 1 inch along
the western edge of the area, though very dry fuels and a deep
boundary layer could allow for some risk for new fire ignitions.

..Wendt.. 07/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1240 AM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will remain nearly stationary across the
Central Plains on Thursday. A weak shortwave is forecast to move
through the flow on the western extent of this upper level ridge
across northern California and central Oregon Thursday afternoon.
Ascent associated with this shortwave trough, combined with
significant surface heating and destabilization will be sufficient
for isolated to widely scattered thunderstorm development. LCLs are
forecast to be above 3km with PWAT values around 0.7. This should
result in mostly dry storms over areas with near record ERC values,
which will support an isolated dry thunderstorm threat. Otherwise,
winds will be mostly light and therefore, no elevated delineations
are warranted.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure is favored to promote above norm=
al
temperatures throughout much of the lower 48 during week-2, with an elevate=
d
risk of excessive heat across the north-central and southwestern contiguous
U.S. Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is likely to result in a we=
t
pattern for western Mainland Alaska during the period, which may adversely
affect saturated grounds resulting from heavy precipitation forecast during
week-1.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the Northern Great Plains and the Upper
Mississippi Valley, Fri-Sun, Aug 6-8.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Great Plains, Mississippi
Valley, Rockies, Great Basin, Southwest and California, Fri-Tue, Aug 6-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for western Mainland Alaska, Fri-Sun, Au=

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 06 - THURSDAY AUGUST 12: There is multi-model agreement
favoring an area of anomalous 500-hPa ridging shifting east across the
northern
tier of the CONUS by the start of week-2. Consistent with previous guidance=
,
increasing mid-level heights remain favored to overspread the northeastern
CONUS and increase chances for above-normal temperatures over this part of =
the
country during the early to middle portion of the period. Upstream, ensembl=
es
continue to advertise the development of a shortwave trough over the easter=
n
Pacific which is expected to bring cooler temperatures to parts of the
northwestern CONUS early in the period. However, there are stronger signals=
 in
the latest ensembles for anomalous subtropical ridging to the south which
increases the potential for anomalously warm temperatures and possible
excessive heat over the higher elevations of the West and the southwestern
CONUS during the period.



Given the persistence of anomalous mid-level ridging forecast aloft, both t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict an area over the Dakotas and Minneso=
ta
with at least a 40% chance of maximum daily temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 90 degrees F, supporting the continuation of a moderate risk
for
excessive heat posted for early in the period (Aug 6 to 8). Compared to
yesterday's guidance, there is a broader coverage in both the GEFS and the
ECMWF reforecast tools in the depiction of at least a 20% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, and a 20% chance for temperatur=
es
in the Desert Southwest, Central California and the higher elevations of th=
e
Great Basin exceeding 110, 100 and 95 degrees F, respectively. As a result,=
 a
slight risk area for excessive heat remains posted and is now expanded from
the
southwestern CONUS to the Upper Mississippi Valley for Aug 6 to 10 relative=
 to
yesterday's outlook. The continuation of above-normal temperatures during
week-2 is anticipated to worsen ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme drought (D=
4)
conditions being felt throughout much of the western and central CONUS, as
well
as further dry fuels and sustain an elevated wildfire risk. Farther east, b=
oth
reforecast tools indicate increased probabilities of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile tied to the increased mid-level heights favor=
ed
over the northeastern CONUS during the early to middle part of the period.
However, these temperatures are not expected to reach hazard thresholds, th=
us
no corresponding hazards are issued.



The Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) day-7 surface analysis continues to
feature a stalled frontal boundary draped across the Southeast and extendin=
g
into the coastal Mid-Atlantic. The heaviest precipitation is forecast along
this boundary during late week-1, with ensembles favoring decreased daily
rainfall amounts by the start of the week-2 period. This is reflected in th=
e
reforecast tools which no longer show elevated signals for precipitation
exceeding the 85th percentile early in the period. Therefore the slight ris=
k
of
heavy precipitation is not included in today's outlook. In the Pacific
Northwest, the aforementioned mid-level trough is expected to promote
above-normal precipitation through the middle portion of the period. Howeve=
r,
these amounts are not expected to reach hazard thresholds, as any increase =
in
precipitation should benefit moisture starved soils in the Northwest. Acros=
s
the Desert Southwest, ensemble means feature the mid-level ridge axis
displaced
to the south of the Four Corners region, which is anticipated to suppress
monsoonal moisture advection precluding a related precipitation hazard from
being designated.



Across Alaska, the deterministic GFS continues to favor the potential for
heavy
precipitation during week-1 with localized daily amounts in excess of 2 inc=
hes
for parts of the western Mainland by this weekend. This wet pattern looks t=
o
continue during week-2, with mid-level troughing and surface low formation
favored across the Bering Sea where reforecast tools indicate elevated chan=
ces
for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile across parts =
of
the western and southern Mainland. The continued wet pattern may adversely
affect antecedent wet conditions, and a slight risk of heavy precipitation
remains posted across the western half of the Mainland during early week-2.

256 PM EDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Aug 1 2021 - 12Z Thu Aug 5 2021

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for The South and The
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic...

19Z Update: The 12Z model suite is in very good synoptic scale
agreement through at least Tuesday with a trough anchored in place
across the east-central U.S. and an upper ridge over the Rockies
and Intermountain West.  More differences become evident across
southern Canada by Wednesday and beyond, with the GFS indicating
more of a split flow pattern with the eastern trough, and the CMC
showing a more robust upper ridge extending into south-central
Canada where the GFS/ECMWF have northern stream shortwave energy
passing through that region.  Heavy rainfall still remains to be
an issue for portions of the southeastern U.S. next week as a
stalled frontal boundary and favorable upper level support remain
in place there, with the ridge over the Atlantic halting eastward
progress of the trough over the eastern U.S.  Otherwise, the
forecast remains close to the previous version, and the overnight
forecast discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support periodic reinforcement of an unseasonably
deep and persistent eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over a warmed Northwest and elsewhere with monsoonal clouds and
moisture.

Meanwhile, uncertain shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will dig
downstream into an eastern U.S. mean upper trough. Favorable
support aloft may help to produce strong convection and locally
heavy downpours/runoff issues as moisture/instability pool near
wavy fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery, especially
with training/repeat cells. Enhanced waves will lift on the
eastern periphery of the upper trough over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic to favor additional heavy rainfall. The
pattern favors modestly below normal post-frontal temperatures
farther northward over the central and eastern U.S. while The
South/Southeast will in contrast be quite steamy with widespread
record warm low temperatures possible along/south of the main
front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability into
early next week before introduction of closer to normal forecast
spread and uncertainty. The WPC medium range product suite was
derived from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian Days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday) along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned WPC blend weights
Tuesday-next Thursday from the models to the ensemble means.
Placed highest weighting for this latter period on the 12 UTC
ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean that maintain pattern amplitude on
the higher end of the full envelope of solutions. This seems
reasonable considering the generally blocky nature of the flow and
WPC product continuity. The 00 UTC GFS/UKMET/Canadian have now
trended in this direction.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 04 - 08 2021

Todays numerical model solutions from the GEFS and ECMWF forecast suites ar=
e
better-aligned regarding the temperature and precipitation fields, relative=
 to
yesterday's forecast. However, differences in the magnitudes of features
remain
in the depicted 500-hPa height anomalies across the CONUS between the two
models. A persistent and anomalously strong closed 500-hPa low is predicted
over the Bering Sea. A split-flow pattern is predicted downstream of the
closed
low over the Bering Sea, leading to favored 500-hPa ridging across
southeastern
Alaska and troughing forecast farther to the south off the coast of the
Pacific
Northwest. Subtropical ridging is expected to dominate much of the west-
central
CONUS during the 6-10 day period. An anomalously strong trough is expected
across the eastern CONUS, but is slightly deamplified, relative to yesterda=
y's
forecast. The manual 500-hPa height blend, based on the ensemble means from
the
GEFS and ECMWF models, supports below-normal heights across the Middle
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, coastal areas of the Pacific
Northwest, southeastern Mainland Alaska, and the Aleutians. Near to
above-normal 500-hPa heights are expected elsewhere across the forecast
domain.

Above-normal temperatures are favored across southeastern Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle, associated with a mean mid-level ridge ahead of a clo=
sed
mid-level low forecast over the Bering Sea. Eastward progression of the mea=
n
closed low over the Bering Sea increases odds of below-normal temperatures
along the western Mainland Coast and the Aleutians. On the North Slope, mod=
el
guidance is in good agreement with a localized area of below-normal
temperature
probabilities, supported by several forecast tools. With subtropical ridgin=
g
expected to dominate much of the western CONUS, above-normal temperatures a=
re
favored across the West, extending northeastward across the Central and
Northern Plains to the Great Lakes, with the highest probabilities over the
Northern Plains. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperatures are
forecast for the Southern Plains, Tennessee, Ohio and Lower Mississippi
Valleys, and much of the East Coast, associated with a mean trough that is
expected to deamplify during the period. Over the southern Florida Peninsul=
a,
above-normal temperatures are favored ahead of a mean frontal boundary.

Ahead of the closed mid-level low predicted over the Bering Sea, above-norm=
al
precipitation is favored over much of Mainland Alaska and the eastern
Aleutians. Split mid-level flow and weak synoptic forcing during the period
tilts odds toward near-normal precipitation across the eastern Alaska Mainl=
and
and Panhandle. Troughing to the south of the split mid-level flow favors
above-normal precipitation in the Pacific Northwest. A mean ridge over the
west-central CONUS enhances odds for below-normal precipitation across the
interior West and Central and Northern Plains. Surface high pressure is
expected to dominate across much of the eastern CONUS, leading to below-nor=
mal
precipitation probabilities across the Midwest and interior Northeast. The
Atlantic subtropical ridge is expected to start building back its western
periphery during the 6-10 day period, increasing odds for above-normal
precipitation across the Southeast and Gulf Coast along a mean frontal
boundary. Over the Desert Southwest and Four Corners Region, model solution=
s
are in agreement regarding a slight northeastward shift of the mean positiv=
e
500-hPa height anomaly center over the Four Corners, leading to a potential=
ly
more favorable orientation for increased monsoonal moisture beyond day 10.
However, models continue to favor near to below-normal precipitation during
the
6-10 day period.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5 due =
to
continued disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation fields
across the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 06 - 12 2021

During the Week-2 period, numerical model guidance depicts a generally simi=
lar
500-hPa flow pattern to that predicted for the 6-10 day period in terms of
phasing, but having a lower amplitude. A strong mid-level low is forecast t=
o
persist and progress eastward over the Bering Sea during the Week-2 period,
continuing an active pattern for western and interior Alaska. Downstream,
ridging is forecast to continue over eastern Alaska and a weak trough is
forecast farther to the south off the coast of the Pacific Northwest.
Subtropical ridging close to climatological strength is predicted across th=
e
west-central CONUS. A trough is forecast to persist early in Week-2 across =
the
East and weaken as time progresses.

In Alaska, enhanced onshore flow to the east of the mean mid-level low over
the
Bering Sea, that continues to progress eastward in todays model solutions,
favors increased odds for below-normal temperatures over much of Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. Above-normal temperatures are favored for the
western
and northern CONUS, with enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities ov=
er
the Northern Plains, exacerbated by ongoing drought. Over the Southeast,
westward to Texas, probabilities of below-normal temperatures are reduced,
relative to yesterdays Week-2 forecast, as the air mass behind the predicte=
d
mean frontal boundary across the Southeast is expected to moderate as the
Atlantic subtropical ridge builds westward during the period. Ahead of the
mean
front, above-normal temperatures are favored over the Florida Peninsula.

With the persistent mid-level low forecast over the Bering Sea, an active,
wetter-than-normal pattern is forecast to continue well into Week-2 across
Mainland Alaska into the Panhandle, and across the eastern Aleutians. Odds
tilt
toward above-normal precipitation across parts of the Pacific Northwest, ah=
ead
of a mean trough to the south of mean split mid-level flow that is expected=
 to
deamplify during the period. Below-normal precipitation is favored for much=
 of
the interior West, extending eastward to the Great Plains, associated with
mean
subtropical ridging across the west-central CONUS. From the Mississippi Val=
ley
eastward, there are increased odds of above-normal precipitation, as the
western periphery of the Atlantic subtropical ridge is predicted to build
during the period, increasing southerly flow and moisture transport from th=
e
Gulf of Mexico. The positive mid-level height anomaly center over the Four
Corners is favored to retain its southward position, which would tend to
suppress any major northward surges of monsoonal moisture, leading to near =
to
below-normal precipitation odds across the Southwest. However, there is som=
e
increased disagreement among the model guidance with regard to the
eastward-to-northeastward progression and mean position of this feature, wh=
ich
affects the potential for southerly monsoonal moisture surges, adding to
uncertainty in that region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
large uncertainty among the model guidance and forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

Adjusted the dry thunderstorm area based on the most recent
guidance. The previous forecast's reasoning otherwise remains valid.

..Wendt.. 07/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CDT Thu Jul 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Monsoon moisture will continue to stream northward across the
western CONUS on Friday. This moisture combined with significant
surface heating is forecast to bring weak destabilization across
portions of the Northwest. This destabilization should be sufficient
for at least isolated thunderstorm development from northern
California across Oregon and Idaho and into southwest Montana. PWAT
values in this area will be around 0.75 to 1 inch which should
result in a mix of wet and dry storms. However, near-record dry
fuels are present and thus even wetter storms could result in new
starts, especially along the periphery of cores. Therefore, an
isolated dry thunderstorm delineation is warranted. Elsewhere, winds
are forecast to remain light and thus, no elevated areas are
justified.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
356 PM EDT Thu Jul 29 2021

Valid 00Z Fri Jul 30 2021 - 00Z Sun Aug 01 2021

...Severe thunderstorms likely from the Middle Mississippi Valley
to the Mid-Atlantic through Friday morning...

...Excessive rainfall with isolated flash flooding possible over
parts of the Northeast through Friday morning...

...Potentially heavy rainfall fueled by monsoonal moisture could
produce scattered flash flooding in the Southwest and Central
Great Basin for the first half of the weekend...

...Widespread Heat Advisories and Excessive Heat Watches/Warnings
are in effect for much of the central US and Pacific Northwest...

A low pressure wave positioned over the Lower Great Lakes with a
cold front trailing southwest through the Ohio Valley to the
Central High Plains and a warm front pushing ahead over the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast will be the focus for much of the
activity affecting the eastern half of the CONUS during the
short-range period. An unstable, moist airmass within the warm
sector is expected to interact with upper-level shortwave energy
and forcing at the surface via the cold front to generate
scattered thunderstorms as well as multicell clusters. Due to the
potential for these storms to become severe and produce damaging
gusts and possibly a tornado or two, the Storm Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms for the Ohio
Valley, Central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic through Friday
morning. Because southeastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey,
northern Delaware, and northeastern Maryland have the greatest
likelihood of experiencing these conditions, an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms has been issued for these areas. Taking into
consideration the potential for localized flash flooding in the
Northeast due to antecedent saturated soils and expected rainfall
totals of 1 to 3 inches with the passage of this system, the
Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive
Rainfall for the region through tomorrow morning.

Overnight tonight the western tail end of the cold front is
expected to become stationary over the Central High Plains and
combine with a low pressure wave that slowly drifts from southern
to northern Colorado. As the wave becomes embedded within the
front it is expected to lift further north into Nebraska with a
warm front extending out to the east across the state. This warm
front will serve as the focus for convective development on Friday
as it interacts with a moist and unstable boundary layer. As
afternoon vertical wind profiles become more favorable a cluster
of severe thunderstorms will likely develop. Seeing as these
storms could generate large hail and gusty winds, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
for parts of eastern Nebraska from Friday morning until Saturday
morning. Localized flash flooding will be possible Friday through
Saturday along a northwest-southeast axis from southern South
Dakota to Tennessee due to the potential for these storms to
produce rainfall totals of 1 to 2+ inches in 24 hours.
Southeastern Missouri will be at greatest risk for flash flooding
on Saturday, therefore, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for the area beginning Saturday
morning.

Shifting focus to the Southwest, Great Basin and Central/Southern
Rockies, showers and thunderstorms are expected to continue
throughout the period as the pressure pattern aloft aids the
transport of monsoonal moisture into the aforementioned regions.
Anomalously high precipitable water values are expected to combine
with upper-level energy as well as surface instability due to
diurnal heating to produce heavy rainfall on top of already moist
soils. Given the potential for high rain rates, antecedent wet
conditions, and scattered burn scars throughout the affected
areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive rainfall for parts of the Southwest through Friday
morning due to the possible occurrence of localized flash
flooding. On Friday, the flash flooding concern is expected to
spread north into the the Central Great Basin and Central Rockies,
prompting the issuance of Slight Risk areas in those regions for
Friday along with the Southwest. By Saturday the flash flooding
risk is expected to shift even further north into the Northern
Great Basin while simultaneously abating in the Southwest. As
such, for Saturday a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been
issued for the southern Oregon/Idaho border and parts of the
Central Rockies.

Widespread Heat Advisories are currently in effect from the
Central Plains/Ohio Valley to the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Southeast as hot afternoon temperatures and high humidity
are expected to mix to generate heat index values between 100 and
110 degrees, with isolated higher values possible. Excessive heat
warnings are also in effect for parts of Kansas, Missouri,
Oklahoma, and Mississippi. Throughout northern California and the
Pacific Northwest Excessive Heat Watches and Warnings as well as
Heat Advisories are also in effect for areas where temperatures on
Friday are forecast to be 10+ degrees above average, with highs
reaching the upper 90s and low 100s. The main concern with these
hot temperatures and/or high heat index values is the onset of
heat related illness if the proper precautions aren't taken.
Residents within the previously mentioned regions are urged to
drink plenty of fluids, stay in air conditioned rooms, stay out of
the sun, and reschedule strenuous activities to the early morning
or evening to safeguard their health.

Elsewhere, tropical moisture being pumped into the Gulf Coast
states and Florida will help fuel the development of daily showers
and thunderstorms through Saturday. Anomalously high precipitable
water values over Florida could allow rain rates within these
storms to reach 1.5 - 2 inches per hour, which may lead to
isolated flooding, primarily in urban areas, through Friday
morning. Lastly, Air Quality Alerts are currently in effect for
portions of Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, Minnesota, and Iowa
due to smoke from ongoing wildfires out west and in Canada being
advected into their areas by the prevailing
northerly-northwesterly winds.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for The South and The
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic...

19Z Update: The 12Z model suite is in very good synoptic scale
agreement through at least Tuesday with a trough anchored in place
across the east-central U.S. and an upper ridge over the Rockies
and Intermountain West.  More differences become evident across
southern Canada by Wednesday and beyond, with the GFS indicating
more of a split flow pattern with the eastern trough, and the CMC
showing a more robust upper ridge extending into south-central
Canada where the GFS/ECMWF have northern stream shortwave energy
passing through that region.  Heavy rainfall still remains to be
an issue for portions of the southeastern U.S. next week as a
stalled frontal boundary and favorable upper level support remain
in place there, with the ridge over the Atlantic halting eastward
progress of the trough over the eastern U.S.  Otherwise, the
forecast remains close to the previous version, and the overnight
forecast discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support periodic reinforcement of an unseasonably
deep and persistent eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over a warmed Northwest and elsewhere with monsoonal clouds and
moisture.

Meanwhile, uncertain shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will dig
downstream into an eastern U.S. mean upper trough. Favorable
support aloft may help to produce strong convection and locally
heavy downpours/runoff issues as moisture/instability pool near
wavy fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery, especially
with training/repeat cells. Enhanced waves will lift on the
eastern periphery of the upper trough over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic to favor additional heavy rainfall. The
pattern favors modestly below normal post-frontal temperatures
farther northward over the central and eastern U.S. while The
South/Southeast will in contrast be quite steamy with widespread
record warm low temperatures possible along/south of the main
front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability into
early next week before introduction of closer to normal forecast
spread and uncertainty. The WPC medium range product suite was
derived from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian Days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday) along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned WPC blend weights
Tuesday-next Thursday from the models to the ensemble means.
Placed highest weighting for this latter period on the 12 UTC
ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean that maintain pattern amplitude on
the higher end of the full envelope of solutions. This seems
reasonable considering the generally blocky nature of the flow and
WPC product continuity. The 00 UTC GFS/UKMET/Canadian have now
trended in this direction.

pattern favors modestly below normal post-frontal temperatures
farther northward over the central and eastern U.S. while The
South/Southeast will in contrast be quite steamy with widespread
record warm low temperatures possible along/south of the main
front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability into
early next week before introduction of closer to normal forecast
spread and uncertainty. The WPC medium range product suite was
derived from a blend of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian Days 3/4 (Sunday/Monday) along with the 01
UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned WPC blend weights
Tuesday-next Thursday from the models to the ensemble means.
Placed highest weighting for this latter period on the 12 UTC
ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble mean that maintain pattern amplitude on
the higher end of the full envelope of solutions. This seems
reasonable considering the generally blocky nature of the flow and
WPC product continuity. The 00 UTC GFS/UKMET/Canadian have now
trended in this direction.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for The South and The
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic...

19Z Update: The 12Z model suite is in very good synoptic scale
agreement through at least Tuesday with a trough anchored in place
across the east-central U.S. and an upper ridge over the Rockies
and Intermountain West.  More differences become evident across
southern Canada by Wednesday and beyond, with the GFS indicating
more of a split flow pattern with the eastern trough, and the CMC
showing a more robust upper ridge extending into south-central
Canada where the GFS/ECMWF have northern stream shortwave energy
passing through that region.  Heavy rainfall still remains to be
an issue for portions of the southeastern U.S. next week as a
stalled frontal boundary and favorable upper level support remain
in place there, with the ridge over the Atlantic halting eastward
progress of the trough over the eastern U.S.  Otherwise, the
forecast remains close to the previous version, and the overnight
forecast discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support periodic reinforcement of an unseasonably
deep and persistent eastern Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over a warmed Northwest and elsewhere with monsoonal clouds and
moisture.

Meanwhile, uncertain shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will dig
downstream into an eastern U.S. mean upper trough. Favorable
support aloft may help to produce strong convection and locally
heavy downpours/runoff issues as moisture/instability pool near
wavy fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery, especially
with training/repeat cells. Enhanced waves will lift on the
eastern periphery of the upper trough over the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic to favor additional heavy rainfall. The
pattern favors modestly below normal post-frontal temperatures
farther northward over the central and eastern U.S. while The
South/Southeast will in contrast be quite steamy with widespread
record warm low temperatures possible along/south of the main
front.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1253 AM CDT Fri Jul 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a weak upper-level impulse
over the Great Basin that is providing sufficient lift for scattered
monsoonal thunderstorms over parts of the Intermountain West. This
feature will gradually shift north over the next 24 hours on the
western periphery of a persistent ridge. While this feature will
yield a nebulous surface pressure pattern and weak winds, it will
maintain thunderstorm chances across much of the West, including
areas of the Pacific Northwest where fuels have largely struggled to
recover despite a modest influx of monsoonal moisture.

...Pacific Northwest...
Isolated thunderstorms, already ongoing across parts of
south-central OR, are expected to increase in coverage through the
mid to late afternoon from the West Coast into central ID and far
southwest MT. A northward flux of mid-level moisture will maintain
PWAT values above 0.75 inches, but dry boundary layers on the
periphery of the deeper moisture (as sampled by the 00z MFR and BOI
soundings) may limit rainfall amounts at the surface to isolated
cores. Although several surface stations have reported wetting
rainfall over the past few days, recent fuel reports from the region
indicate that dry fuels are slow to respond to the recent moisture
and are still promoting active fire behavior. The combination of
wet/dry thunderstorm chances and dry fuels supports the isolated
dry-thunderstorm risk. A few dry lightning strikes are possible as
far northeast as north-central MT, but a combination of weaker
forcing for ascent (and hence less confidence in coverage) as well
as slightly improved boundary-layer RH precludes an expansion into
this region.

...Lingering monsoonal moisture and heavier rain for parts of the
Interior West Monday..

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South/Southeast and
perhaps Mid-Atlantic...


...Overview...

Positive height anomalies over western/central Canada and
southwest of California will favor continued troughing in the
eastern states next week. This will promote cooler than normal
temperatures east of the Plains with highest rainfall chances
along and ahead of a slowly southward-moving cold front into the
Southeast. The Interior West will see diminishing rainfall,
focused along the Rockies and perhaps shifting to the Plains later
next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, the models and ensembles remained in
good agreement overall with the pattern evolution through about
midweek. Recent deterministic runs have wavered on how quickly (or
slowly) to bring in height falls the Pac NW late in the week (or
beyond) and at what pace to erode troughing settling into the Ohio
Valley. Multi-day ensemble trends favor a slower trend in the East
to raise heights but a split trend in the Pac NW between the ECMWF
ensembles (slower to bring in height falls) vs the GEFS ensembles
(quicker). Favored the ECMWF ensembles by next Thu/Fri with
support from the Canadian and some GFS runs as well as the lack of
a clear upstream kicker over Alaska.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With the upper high around the lower CO River Monday, mid-level
energy will spur afternoon convection over the northern/central
Rockies, some of which may contain heavier rain. As heights build
a bit over the Southwest, the moisture source will decrease and
rain coverage/intensity will decrease through the week. In the
East/Southeast, troughing will push a cold front close to or into
the Gulf by midweek. Abundant moisture ahead of the boundary will
support heavier rain chances anywhere from Texas eastward to the
Carolinas. As the upper pattern remains mostly in place, the front
may wobble about due, in part, to areas of low pressure that may
act to enhance rainfall into the Mid-Atlantic.

Temperatures will slowly moderate from below normal in much of the
Interior West (owing to clouds and rainfall) early in the week to
near or slightly above normal by the end of next week. Areas along
the Canadian border may see the warmest anomalies of +5 to +10
from eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes. Much of the
East/Southeast will see near to below normal temperatures along
and behind the cold front, perhaps as much as 10 degrees below
normal for early August on some days.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CDT Fri Jul 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The weak upper-level impulse currently over the Great Basin will
shift into the Pacific Northwest through the day Saturday. Deeper
monsoonal moisture will accompany this feature and increase
probabilities for wetting rainfall. This will also result in
widespread cloud cover and relatively weak flow at the surface,
reducing the potential for wind/RH-driven fire weather threats
(though local concerns are possible).

...Pacific Northwest...
Rain chances will spread from southern ID and southeast OR northward
into western ID/southeast WA through the day Saturday. Ensemble
guidance shows the highest probabilities for wetting rainfall across
eastern OR/southern ID by late Saturday night. While thunderstorms
are likely along and east of the Cascades, muted boundary-layer
heating/mixing and wetting rainfall potential will limit the
dry-thunderstorm risk. Localized elevated wind/RH conditions may
develop across southeastern WA and central MT Saturday afternoon as
winds increase to near 15 mph amid 15-20% RH and dry fuels. However,
ensemble guidance shows low probability for sustained 15+ mph winds
and cloud cover will likely limit RH reductions and boundary-layer
heating. As such, no risk areas are introduced.

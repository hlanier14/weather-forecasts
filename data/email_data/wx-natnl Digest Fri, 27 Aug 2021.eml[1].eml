No changes. Previous discussion follows.

..Bentley.. 08/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1240 AM CDT Thu Aug 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough over the West will continue translating
east/northeast today, bringing the potential for wetting showers and
thunderstorms to much of the Rockies. Fire weather concerns will
primarily be driven by dry thunderstorm chances across
east/northeast Wyoming and locally elevated wind/RH conditions
across parts of the eastern Great Basin.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Recent ensemble guidance continues to show a QPF minimum across
eastern WY this afternoon - likely the result of isolated
shower/thunderstorm coverage and a deep, dry boundary layer.
Forecast soundings continue to show favorable thermodynamic profiles
for dry lightning potential with 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE, PWAT values
near 0.5-0.6 inches, and fast storm motions. Any storms that
propagate into east/northeastern WY will have the potential for
several dry lightning strikes. Recent fuel guidance shows fuels
remain dry with ERC values near the 75th percentile, warranting the
maintenance of the dry thunderstorm highlight.

...Eastern Great Basin...
Daytime heating will likely drive at least modest boundary-layer
mixing by early afternoon that will support breezy conditions (winds
between 15-20 mph) prior to shower/thunderstorm development by mid
to late afternoon. Relative humidity may fall as low as 10-15% for
some locations, resulting in pockets of elevated wind/RH conditions.
Locations from far eastern NV/western UT into southwest WY will see
the highest potential for meeting such wind/RH criteria, but
generally unreceptive fuels and limited spatial coverage and
duration preclude the need for highlights. One consideration is the
potential impact these conditions may have on any holdover fires
after dry lightning activity across UT/southwest WY over the past 24
hours (though the aforementioned fuel status suggests holdover
potential is low).

...Heavy rain threat for areas along and north of the central Gulf
Coast for early next week with tropical system...

18Z Update: The newly designated Tropical Depression Nine is
becoming more defined in the extended forecast guidance, with the
15Z NHC forecast track closest to a compromise of the 12Z GEFS
mean and 12Z UKMET.  The CMC is the fastest solution throughout
the period, and the GFS is the second fastest through Tuesday
before becoming more in line with the model consensus.  The 00Z
ECENS is on the southwest edge of the guidance, and this will
likely adjust to the northeast with its 12Z run, similar to other
guidance over the past 24 hours.  As a result of these changes,
the axis of heaviest rainfall has trended a little more to the
east with this forecast cycle, and additional adjustments to the
track are likely with future forecast updates.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., the guidance is generally
in good agreement on the synoptic scale, except for some timing
differences noted in the CMC, particularly the 00Z run that was
becoming out of phase across the Great Lakes region.  It is also
worth noting that the eventual track of Tropical Storm Nora could
have implications on rainfall across the Desert Southwest by the
end of the forecast period late next week, with a chance of heavy
rain moving northward across this region.  The updated forecast
was primarily derived from a blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/some CMC
through Tuesday, and then primarily the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous
discussion follows below. /Hamrick


...Overview...

By mid-late next week the ongoing pattern of progressive flow
aloft extending from the northeastern Pacific across the northern
tier U.S./southern Canada shows signs of slowing down as mean
troughing becomes more established over western Canada into the
northwestern U.S. as well as over eastern Canada into the
northeastern states, with a ridge building in-between.  A leading
shortwave will push a Midwest/Plains front into the East while the
upper trough pushing into western North America will bring a cold
front into the Northwest.  At lower latitudes, guidance still
exhibits some spread and trends but offers increasing confidence
that a Caribbean wave will ultimately generate a tropical system
that will track northward over the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southern U.S. as it finds a weakness within the mean ridge across
the southern half of the country.  This system would produce
hazards including heavy rainfall and strong winds.  The heavy
rainfall threat may extend northward depending on system track and
possible interaction with the front that stalls after reaching the
eastern U.S.  In addition the National Hurricane Center is issuing
advisories on eastern Pacific Tropical Depression Fourteen-E which
should eventually strengthen to a hurricane for a time and track
close to Baja California.  Some moisture from Fourteen-E could
eventually reach the Southwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

For the possible tropical system tracking over the Gulf of Mexico,
trends are less dramatic than seen over the past couple days but
the 18Z GFS provided yet another adjustment on the faster/eastward
side of the spread versus other guidance.  The new 00Z GFS backed
off a bit on its speed versus the 18Z run while the 00Z CMC is
close to the GFS for most of the period (and east of the 12Z run).
 The 00Z UKMET agrees with the model consensus for a Louisiana
landfall and is close to the 12Z ECMWF/00Z GEFS mean but is slower
than the new GFS/CMC.  The new 00Z ECMWF continues the
faster/eastward theme.  While specifics remain uncertain, these
latest model runs are increasing confidence in tropical
development and a track somewhere toward the central Gulf Coast.
Based on guidance available at the time of forecast preparation,
the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/GFS provided the composite template in principle
along with a compromise with continuity.  A blend of those models
compared rather well to the ensemble means for the significant
northern stream features through the period so even by day 7
Thursday the forecast needed to employ only a modest weight of the
means to smooth the proverbial rough edges.  There has been a
noticeable slower trend with the leading side of the incoming
western trough aloft which has a corresponding effect on surface
features eventually reaching the northern Plains.  Finally,
guidance is not well clustered for Fourteen-E so confidence is
well below average for how much moisture from this system may
eventually reach the southwestern U.S. and where.  The 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean were the closest solutions to the track from the
03Z National Hurricane Center advisory.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest guidance is adding to confidence in the general
forecast of tropical development and potential impacts, most
likely along and near the central Gulf Coast from late weekend
into next week.  However there is still a fair degree of
uncertainty for exact track and timing (with somewhat of an
eastward trend still evident) since guidance has not sufficiently
stabilized yet for those aspects of the system.  Current consensus
would extend the heavy rain threat northward at least into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee Valley.  How this
moisture may interact with a front that stalls over the East will
require monitoring as well.  Before the tropical system's arrival
this front will be accompanied by areas of rain and thunderstorms
as it progresses from the Midwest/Plains into the East during the
first half of the week.  The trailing part of the front over the
Plains may provide a focus for one or more episodes of rainfall
over portions of the Midwest/northern tier states.  A wavy
stationary/warm front over the Northeast may focus some rainfall
Sunday-Monday.  With time rainfall should gradually increase in
coverage and intensity over the Southwest and vicinity as the
upper pattern becomes more favorable for drawing some moisture
from western Mexico and the eastern Pacific.  A significant wild
card will be the exact track of Tropical Depression Fourteen-E and
how its moisture may ultimately be incorporated into the flow.

Locations from the Great Lakes into the southern Mid-Atlantic will
be quite warm to hot at the start of the week, ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains/Midwest.  Expect somewhat greater
coverage of plus 10-15F anomalies for morning lows relative to
daytime highs, with daily records also more likely for warm lows.
Then eastern U.S. temperatures will moderate over the rest of the
week.  California and the Great Basin will see moderately above
normal highs Sunday-Monday.  Then a majority of the West will see
a cooling trend to below normal highs as an upper trough reaches
the Northwest and clouds/rainfall expand over the Southwest.  The
central High Plains will see highs 5-10F or so above normal
Monday-Wednesday.

...Heavy rain threat for areas along and north of the central Gulf
Coast for early next week with tropical system...

18Z Update: The newly designated Tropical Depression Nine is
becoming more defined in the extended forecast guidance, with the
15Z NHC forecast track closest to a compromise of the 12Z GEFS
mean and 12Z UKMET.  The CMC is the fastest solution throughout
the period, and the GFS is the second fastest through Tuesday
before becoming more in line with the model consensus.  The 00Z
ECENS is on the southwest edge of the guidance, and this will
likely adjust to the northeast with its 12Z run, similar to other
guidance over the past 24 hours.  As a result of these changes,
the axis of heaviest rainfall has trended a little more to the
east with this forecast cycle, and additional adjustments to the
track are likely with future forecast updates.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., the guidance is generally
in good agreement on the synoptic scale, except for some timing
differences noted in the CMC, particularly the 00Z run that was
becoming out of phase across the Great Lakes region.  It is also
worth noting that the eventual track of Tropical Storm Nora could
have implications on rainfall across the Desert Southwest by the
end of the forecast period late next week, with a chance of heavy
rain moving northward across this region.  The updated forecast
was primarily derived from a blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/some CMC
through Tuesday, and then primarily the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous
discussion follows below. /Hamrick


...Overview...

By mid-late next week the ongoing pattern of progressive flow
aloft extending from the northeastern Pacific across the northern
tier U.S./southern Canada shows signs of slowing down as mean
troughing becomes more established over western Canada into the
northwestern U.S. as well as over eastern Canada into the
northeastern states, with a ridge building in-between.  A leading
shortwave will push a Midwest/Plains front into the East while the
upper trough pushing into western North America will bring a cold
front into the Northwest.  At lower latitudes, guidance still
exhibits some spread and trends but offers increasing confidence
that a Caribbean wave will ultimately generate a tropical system
that will track northward over the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southern U.S. as it finds a weakness within the mean ridge across
the southern half of the country.  This system would produce
hazards including heavy rainfall and strong winds.  The heavy
rainfall threat may extend northward depending on system track and
possible interaction with the front that stalls after reaching the
eastern U.S.  In addition the National Hurricane Center is issuing
advisories on eastern Pacific Tropical Depression Fourteen-E which
should eventually strengthen to a hurricane for a time and track
close to Baja California.  Some moisture from Fourteen-E could
eventually reach the Southwest.

start of week-2 before transitioning to a weak mid-level pattern. The 0Z
Canadian ensemble maintains a fairly weak mid-level pattern throughout week=

with mid-level low pressure favored across the northern tier and high press=

parts of the Northern Plains at the beginning of the period. Some model

additional
tropical cyclone (TC) formation near the Yucatan peninsula and Gulf of Mexi=

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 03 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 09: The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean
favors a more amplified pattern at the start of the period, with mid-level
ridging dominating much of the CONUS during week-2, centered over the
North-Central CONUS, before transitioning to weak troughing (ridging) acros=
s
the western two-thirds (third) of the CONUS. The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean,
however, starts off with fairly weak mid-level low pressure across the
northern
tier and mid-level ridging across the southern CONUS, before transitioning =
to
a
more amplified pattern of mid-level troughing (ridging) across eastern
(western) CONUS by the middle of the period. The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean
generally favors relatively weak mid-level flow, with weak mid-level trough=
ing
shifting eastward across the northern tier from the beginning to middle of =
the
period. Given the agreement of negative 500-hPa height anomalies across the
North-Central CONUS at the beginning of the period in both the ECMWF and
Canadian ensembles, as well as the week-2 mean temperature skill weighted
consolidation tool favoring the ECMWF, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures across parts of the Northern Plains, Sep 3 to 5. The ECMWF
reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling=
 to
the lowest 15th percentile and less than 40 Deg F, which would be the first
cold event of the season with temperatures dipping this low.



Across the south, the aforementioned mid-level amplified ridging could brin=
g
anomalously warm temperatures to the South-Central CONUS. Both the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatur=
es
exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F. There is a possibility for
southerly moist flow to support dewpoints exceeding 70 Deg F across the Sou=
th,
which could support heat index values exceeding 100 Deg F. However, there i=
s
also the potential for lingering rainfall and cloudiness associated with th=
e
remnants of a tropical disturbance which could lower temperatures. The
greatest
chances for these elevated excessive heat risk would be across eastern
portions
of the Southern and Central Plains at the beginning of the period. However,
given these significant differences, particularly with the timing of how th=
ese
factors interact, a heat hazard risk is not anticipated at this time.



As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is currently monitoring =
a
tropical depression nine in the Caribbean. The greatest impacts from this
tropical system would be during week-1, with the deterministic 6Z GFS and 0=
Z
ECMWF indicating the remnants of this disturbance exiting the East Coast by
the
start of week-2. The 12Z deterministic GFS indicates the possibility of a
surface low forming in the Caribbean Sea by the end of week-1, strengthenin=
g
and tracking towards the western Gulf Coast by the middle of week-2. Howeve=
r,
the 6Z deterministic GFS model run favored a weaker surface low. The 0Z
deterministic GFS did show a possible storm forming in the Gulf of Mexico, =
but
tracking further southwestward towards southern coastal Texas. Due to high
model uncertainty, no precipitation hazards are posted at this time but wil=
l
continue to be monitored.



In the eastern Pacific, as of 5:00am PDT, the NHC is monitoring tropical st=
orm
Nora located south of Mexico. Both the deterministic 6Z GFS and 0Z ECMWF
indicates this storm diminishing by week-2. The deterministic 6Z does show =
the
possibility of some surface lows approaching the Gulf of California from th=
e
middle to end of the period, although the disturbances are relatively weak =
and
would not be as supportive of a Gulf Surge event. The ECMWF reforecast tool
does show at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation accumulations exceed=
ing
the 85th percentile and half an inch across New Mexico, Sep 3 to 5. However=
,
this is not supported in the GEFS reforecast tool. Low potential for enhanc=
ed
moisture into the southwestern CONUS associated with tropical storm activit=
y
combined with an unfavorable mean ridge axis position over the southern
portion
of the Four Corners region, decreases chances for enhanced precipitation an=
d
widespread flooding over the Desert Southwest. Therefore a possible flood r=
isk
is not designated across the Four Corners at this time.



Mid-level ridging predicted over Alaska predominately favors above-normal
temperatures and below-normal precipitation across much of the southern
Mainland and Alaska Panhandle, thus no hazards are posted for the state dur=

week-2.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu August 26 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 01 - 05 2021

Dynamical models remain in good agreement regarding the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America during the 6-10 day period. Trough=
s
are initially favored over the Northwestern and Northeastern CONUS, with
ridging across the central CONUS. By the end of the period, the pattern is
forecast to become more zonal, with potentially more troughing developing i=
n
the East. Ridging is initially predicted across the Gulf of Alaska and
extending through eastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. However, this
ridging is forecast to quickly weaken, with weak troughing possibly develop=
ing
over the Bering Sea and the western Mainland. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs manual blend depicts
near
normal 500-hPa heights across most of the CONUS, except the Northeast where
slightly below normal heights are predicted. Positive height anomalies are
favored for much of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, with negative height
anomalies forecast across the Aleutians.

Near to above normal temperature probabilities are increased over the easte=
rn
and central CONUS underneath predicted mid-level ridging early in the perio=
d.
This ridging is forecast to break down by the latter half of the period, an=
d
does so faster in the 0z ECMWF ensemble compared to the 0z GEFS. The GEFS
persists the ridge, and subsequently favors below normal temperatures for t=
he
Northeast with northwesterly mid-level flow. However, the more zonal flow
pattern indicated by the ECMWF favors near to above normal temperatures acr=
oss
the Northeast. Due to the uncertainty, near normal temperatures are favored
for
the Northeast in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast. Near to below =
normal temperatures are
forecast across the western CONUS as a result of troughing, in addition to
enhanced cloud cover and precipitation forecast across the Southwest.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures are increased over nearly all of
Alaska, supported by the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools.

The evolution of the mid-level pattern will play a role in the eventual tra=
ck
of what is currently Tropical Depression Nine (TD9), which is forecast to
impact the Gulf Coast as a hurricane prior to the start of the forecast
period.
A more progressive pattern, as depicted by the ECMWF ensemble, favors the
remnants of TD9 becoming absorbed by a frontal system, bringing enhanced
precipitation chances to much of the eastern CONUS. However, a more persist=
ent
ridge indicated by the GEFS favors a slower moving remnant low, with the
greatest precipitation chances further to the south. As a result, the GEFS
reforecast tool depicts increased chances of below normal precipitation in =
the
Northeast, versus above normal in the ECMWF tool. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs manual forecast
depicts the highest probabilities of above normal precipitation across part=
s
of
the Tennessee Valley, consistent with where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforec=
ast
tools depict the highest precipitation chances. Near normal precipitation i=
s
forecast for the Northeast due to the increased uncertainty.  Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased in locations farther from the
forecast storm track, across portions of the Southern Plains, southeastern
Georgia, and the Florida Peninsula.

Tropical Storm Nora, currently located off the coast of southern Mexico, is
forecast to track northwestward toward Baja California over the next 5 days=
.
The 0z deterministic and ensemble ECMWF runs have been fairly aggressive wi=
th
keeping the system intact and bringing a remnant low into the Southwest CON=
US.
The GEFS predicts a weaker system, but would still result in a Gulf Surge
event
across the region. As a result of increased confidence in regard to potenti=
al
impacts from Nora, probabilities of above normal precipitation are increase=
d
over the Southwest. Further to the north, troughing forecast across the
Northwest favors increased chances of above normal precipitation downstream
across the Rockies and Northern and Central Plains as a result of enhanced
frontal activity. Below normal precipitation probabilities are increased ov=
er
the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest, behind the mean trough axis. Near to
below normal precipitation is favored for most of Alaska due to the ridging
initially forecast over the eastern part of the state, and the weaker flow
pattern to the west. Weak troughing potentially developing over the Bering =
Sea
toward the end of the period may begin to increase southerly moisture flow
over
the southern Mainland, tilting the odds to slightly above normal precipitat=
ion
there.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 03 - 09 2021

A generally low amplitude mid-level flow pattern is forecast across North
America during week-2. Enhanced troughing may become more favored over the
eastern and central CONUS by the middle of the period, resulting in a perio=
d
of
fall-like weather across the northern tier. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs 0z ECMWF ensemble has
shifted to a more robust depiction of this feature compared to yesterday, a=

CONUS. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 0z GEFS and Canadian ensembles bot=

for
troughing as well, but lower in amplitude compared to the ECMWF. Given the
uncertainty in the evolution, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual blen=
d depicts slightly below
normal heights extending from the Northern Plains through the Northeast, an=
d
near to above normal heights elsewhere across the remainder of the CONUS an=

Alaska.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored across most of the CONUS as a
result of the low amplitude mid-level flow pattern forecast. Below normal
temperature probabilities are increased across the northern tier, from the
Northern Plains eastward through the Northeast, as the aforementioned

...The potential for flash flooding and severe weather continues
across portions of the Northern Plains and Midwest...

...Heavy rain and flooding possible for the Mid-Atlantic Friday...

...Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat continues
throughout much of the central and eastern United States, as well
as the Desert Southwest...

A persistent frontal system as well as a shortwave trough moving
across the Northern Tier of the U.S. will continue to lead to the
chance of heavy rain, flooding, and severe weather across portions
of the Northern Plains and Midwest. A quasi-stationary front
draped from the Lower Great Lakes westward through Nebraska should
begin to lift slowly northward as a warm front throughout the day
Friday. Widespread showers and thunderstorms expected overnight
tonight along the boundary and will continue on Friday. There is a
Slight Risk (level 2 of 4) for excessive rainfall Friday for
portions of southeastern Minnesota and central Wisconsin as
another 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected on top of heavy rain
that is already falling across the region today. Additionally, the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2 of 5)
for severe weather for northern Iowa, southeastern Minnesota, and
central Wisconsin as isolation south of the boundary will help
support more robust thunderstorms with the threat of large hail
and high winds. The shortwave approaching from the west on Friday
will also help to begin to push the frontal system eastward across
the Northern High Plains, and thunderstorms are expected to
develop along and ahead of the front. The Storm Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather for portions of
southeastern Montana and the western Dakotas mainly for the threat
of large hail. As the shortwave and frontal system continue east,
thunderstorms are expected to develop again on Saturday with
another Slight Risk highlighted by the Storm Prediction Center for
portions of southern Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin.

Further east, a cold front will push southward through the
Northeast on Friday and begin to stall across the Mid-Atlantic
Friday evening. There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall for
Friday from eastern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland east into
central and northern New Jersey. Showers and storms along the
boundary may produce a couple inches of rain over a region with
recently saturated soils due to heavy rain from Henri. Showers and
storms will continue on Saturday as the front remains
quasi-stationary.

Heat will also be a major story throughout the forecast period.
Ahead of the fronts, highs in the mid- to upper 90s are forecast
from the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas west through the Ohio Valley,
Mississippi Valley, and into the Central Plains on both Friday and
Saturday. High humidity will lead to heat indices closer to 100.
Temperatures will also rise into the 90s over the Great Lakes
region on Saturday. There will be little relief from the heat at
night, as lows are expected to remain well above normal and only
fall into the low to mid-70s. In the Desert Southwest, highs in
the 110s are expected on Friday, and an Excessive Heat Warning
remains in effect for the area through Friday evening. The high
temperatures will cool a little on Saturday but still generally be
in the upper 100s to lower 110s.

Elsewhere, showers and storms are likely along the Gulf Coast as
moisture increases ahead of T.D. Nine, which is forecast by the
National Hurricane Center to move northwestward into the Gulf of
Mexico. Some Monsoonal showers and storms are also possible across
Arizona and New Mexico on Saturday.

0302 PM CDT Thu Aug 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Added an elevated area to south-central and eastern Wyoming. While
today's convection may lead to some moistening fuels, dry fuels are
present across much of eastern Wyoming. In addition, with the
potential for dry thunderstorms today, the dry and breezy conditions
could lead to large fire growth on any starts from today's dry
lightning.

..Bentley.. 08/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Thu Aug 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A weak cold front is forecast to continue pushing southeastward into
the inter-mountain West on Friday. This will cool temperatures and
aid in humidity recovery for parts of the Northwest and northern
Great Basin. An upper-level impulse will help foster strengthening
winds across the central Rockies. Fire weather concerns will most
likely remain localized in nature with low potential for a
robust/widespread fire weather threat.

...Central Rockies...
Winds are forecast to increase across the central Rockies Friday
afternoon in response to the approach of an upper-level shortwave
trough, lee pressure falls, and a tightening low/mid-level pressure
gradient. Hi-res solutions and ensemble guidance show reasonable
probabilities for 15-20 mph winds across eastern ID, northeast UT,
northern CO, and into much of WY that will likely coincide with
diurnal RH reductions to 15-20%. Meeting elevated wind/RH criteria
is probable, and a few locations may experience periods of critical
conditions. While the synoptic regime is favorable for fire weather
concerns, fuels will likely remain unreceptive due to scattered
showers/thunderstorms over the prior 24 hours. Locations that manage
to remain dry may see fine fuels respond sufficiently to support a
fire weather concern.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
Building surface high pressure across northern CA and the Pacific
Northwest will likely drive northerly winds through the northern
Sacramento Valley. Hi-res model guidance hints that terrain
influences will support winds between 15-25 mph during the afternoon
hours when RH is forecast to fall into the teens. Given the dry
fuels across the region, this may support elevated (to perhaps
locally critical) conditions Friday afternoon. However, confidence
in the spatial extent of this threat is uncertain as it may be
closely tied to local terrain features. Trends will be monitored and
highlights may be needed if a more widespread threat becomes
apparent.

...Heavy rain threat for areas along and north of the central Gulf
Coast for early next week with tropical system...

18Z Update: The newly designated Tropical Depression Nine is
becoming more defined in the extended forecast guidance, with the
15Z NHC forecast track closest to a compromise of the 12Z GEFS
mean and 12Z UKMET.  The CMC is the fastest solution throughout
the period, and the GFS is the second fastest through Tuesday
before becoming more in line with the model consensus.  The 00Z
ECENS is on the southwest edge of the guidance, and this will
likely adjust to the northeast with its 12Z run, similar to other
guidance over the past 24 hours.  As a result of these changes,
the axis of heaviest rainfall has trended a little more to the
east with this forecast cycle, and additional adjustments to the
track are likely with future forecast updates.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., the guidance is generally
in good agreement on the synoptic scale, except for some timing
differences noted in the CMC, particularly the 00Z run that was
becoming out of phase across the Great Lakes region.  It is also
worth noting that the eventual track of Tropical Storm Nora could
have implications on rainfall across the Desert Southwest by the
end of the forecast period late next week, with a chance of heavy
rain moving northward across this region.  The updated forecast
was primarily derived from a blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/some CMC
through Tuesday, and then primarily the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous
discussion follows below. /Hamrick


...Overview...

By mid-late next week the ongoing pattern of progressive flow
aloft extending from the northeastern Pacific across the northern
tier U.S./southern Canada shows signs of slowing down as mean
troughing becomes more established over western Canada into the
northwestern U.S. as well as over eastern Canada into the
northeastern states, with a ridge building in-between.  A leading
shortwave will push a Midwest/Plains front into the East while the
upper trough pushing into western North America will bring a cold
front into the Northwest.  At lower latitudes, guidance still
exhibits some spread and trends but offers increasing confidence
that a Caribbean wave will ultimately generate a tropical system
that will track northward over the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southern U.S. as it finds a weakness within the mean ridge across
the southern half of the country.  This system would produce
hazards including heavy rainfall and strong winds.  The heavy
rainfall threat may extend northward depending on system track and
possible interaction with the front that stalls after reaching the
eastern U.S.  In addition the National Hurricane Center is issuing
advisories on eastern Pacific Tropical Depression Fourteen-E which
should eventually strengthen to a hurricane for a time and track
close to Baja California.  Some moisture from Fourteen-E could
eventually reach the Southwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

For the possible tropical system tracking over the Gulf of Mexico,
trends are less dramatic than seen over the past couple days but
the 18Z GFS provided yet another adjustment on the faster/eastward
side of the spread versus other guidance.  The new 00Z GFS backed
off a bit on its speed versus the 18Z run while the 00Z CMC is
close to the GFS for most of the period (and east of the 12Z run).
 The 00Z UKMET agrees with the model consensus for a Louisiana
landfall and is close to the 12Z ECMWF/00Z GEFS mean but is slower
than the new GFS/CMC.  The new 00Z ECMWF continues the
faster/eastward theme.  While specifics remain uncertain, these
latest model runs are increasing confidence in tropical
development and a track somewhere toward the central Gulf Coast.
Based on guidance available at the time of forecast preparation,
the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/GFS provided the composite template in principle
along with a compromise with continuity.  A blend of those models
compared rather well to the ensemble means for the significant
northern stream features through the period so even by day 7
Thursday the forecast needed to employ only a modest weight of the
means to smooth the proverbial rough edges.  There has been a
noticeable slower trend with the leading side of the incoming
western trough aloft which has a corresponding effect on surface
features eventually reaching the northern Plains.  Finally,
guidance is not well clustered for Fourteen-E so confidence is
well below average for how much moisture from this system may
eventually reach the southwestern U.S. and where.  The 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean were the closest solutions to the track from the
03Z National Hurricane Center advisory.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest guidance is adding to confidence in the general
forecast of tropical development and potential impacts, most
likely along and near the central Gulf Coast from late weekend
into next week.  However there is still a fair degree of
uncertainty for exact track and timing (with somewhat of an
eastward trend still evident) since guidance has not sufficiently
stabilized yet for those aspects of the system.  Current consensus
would extend the heavy rain threat northward at least into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee Valley.  How this
moisture may interact with a front that stalls over the East will
require monitoring as well.  Before the tropical system's arrival
this front will be accompanied by areas of rain and thunderstorms
as it progresses from the Midwest/Plains into the East during the
first half of the week.  The trailing part of the front over the
Plains may provide a focus for one or more episodes of rainfall
over portions of the Midwest/northern tier states.  A wavy
stationary/warm front over the Northeast may focus some rainfall
Sunday-Monday.  With time rainfall should gradually increase in
coverage and intensity over the Southwest and vicinity as the
upper pattern becomes more favorable for drawing some moisture
from western Mexico and the eastern Pacific.  A significant wild
card will be the exact track of Tropical Depression Fourteen-E and
how its moisture may ultimately be incorporated into the flow.

Locations from the Great Lakes into the southern Mid-Atlantic will
be quite warm to hot at the start of the week, ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains/Midwest.  Expect somewhat greater
coverage of plus 10-15F anomalies for morning lows relative to
daytime highs, with daily records also more likely for warm lows.
Then eastern U.S. temperatures will moderate over the rest of the
week.  California and the Great Basin will see moderately above
normal highs Sunday-Monday.  Then a majority of the West will see
a cooling trend to below normal highs as an upper trough reaches
the Northwest and clouds/rainfall expand over the Southwest.  The
central High Plains will see highs 5-10F or so above normal
Monday-Wednesday.

end of the forecast period late next week, with a chance of heavy
rain moving northward across this region.  The updated forecast
was primarily derived from a blend of the GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/some CMC
through Tuesday, and then primarily the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective means for Wednesday and Thursday.  The previous
discussion follows below. /Hamrick


...Overview...

By mid-late next week the ongoing pattern of progressive flow
aloft extending from the northeastern Pacific across the northern
tier U.S./southern Canada shows signs of slowing down as mean
troughing becomes more established over western Canada into the
northwestern U.S. as well as over eastern Canada into the
northeastern states, with a ridge building in-between.  A leading
shortwave will push a Midwest/Plains front into the East while the
upper trough pushing into western North America will bring a cold
front into the Northwest.  At lower latitudes, guidance still
exhibits some spread and trends but offers increasing confidence
that a Caribbean wave will ultimately generate a tropical system
that will track northward over the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southern U.S. as it finds a weakness within the mean ridge across
the southern half of the country.  This system would produce
hazards including heavy rainfall and strong winds.  The heavy
rainfall threat may extend northward depending on system track and
possible interaction with the front that stalls after reaching the
eastern U.S.  In addition the National Hurricane Center is issuing
advisories on eastern Pacific Tropical Depression Fourteen-E which
should eventually strengthen to a hurricane for a time and track
close to Baja California.  Some moisture from Fourteen-E could
eventually reach the Southwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

For the possible tropical system tracking over the Gulf of Mexico,
trends are less dramatic than seen over the past couple days but
the 18Z GFS provided yet another adjustment on the faster/eastward
side of the spread versus other guidance.  The new 00Z GFS backed
off a bit on its speed versus the 18Z run while the 00Z CMC is
close to the GFS for most of the period (and east of the 12Z run).
 The 00Z UKMET agrees with the model consensus for a Louisiana
landfall and is close to the 12Z ECMWF/00Z GEFS mean but is slower
than the new GFS/CMC.  The new 00Z ECMWF continues the
faster/eastward theme.  While specifics remain uncertain, these
latest model runs are increasing confidence in tropical
development and a track somewhere toward the central Gulf Coast.
Based on guidance available at the time of forecast preparation,
the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/GFS provided the composite template in principle
along with a compromise with continuity.  A blend of those models
compared rather well to the ensemble means for the significant
northern stream features through the period so even by day 7
Thursday the forecast needed to employ only a modest weight of the
means to smooth the proverbial rough edges.  There has been a
noticeable slower trend with the leading side of the incoming
western trough aloft which has a corresponding effect on surface
features eventually reaching the northern Plains.  Finally,
guidance is not well clustered for Fourteen-E so confidence is
well below average for how much moisture from this system may
eventually reach the southwestern U.S. and where.  The 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean were the closest solutions to the track from the
03Z National Hurricane Center advisory.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest guidance is adding to confidence in the general
forecast of tropical development and potential impacts, most
likely along and near the central Gulf Coast from late weekend
into next week.  However there is still a fair degree of
uncertainty for exact track and timing (with somewhat of an
eastward trend still evident) since guidance has not sufficiently
stabilized yet for those aspects of the system.  Current consensus
would extend the heavy rain threat northward at least into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee Valley.  How this
moisture may interact with a front that stalls over the East will
require monitoring as well.  Before the tropical system's arrival
this front will be accompanied by areas of rain and thunderstorms
as it progresses from the Midwest/Plains into the East during the
first half of the week.  The trailing part of the front over the
Plains may provide a focus for one or more episodes of rainfall
over portions of the Midwest/northern tier states.  A wavy
stationary/warm front over the Northeast may focus some rainfall
Sunday-Monday.  With time rainfall should gradually increase in
coverage and intensity over the Southwest and vicinity as the
upper pattern becomes more favorable for drawing some moisture
from western Mexico and the eastern Pacific.  A significant wild
card will be the exact track of Tropical Depression Fourteen-E and
how its moisture may ultimately be incorporated into the flow.

Locations from the Great Lakes into the southern Mid-Atlantic will
be quite warm to hot at the start of the week, ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains/Midwest.  Expect somewhat greater
coverage of plus 10-15F anomalies for morning lows relative to
daytime highs, with daily records also more likely for warm lows.
Then eastern U.S. temperatures will moderate over the rest of the
week.  California and the Great Basin will see moderately above
normal highs Sunday-Monday.  Then a majority of the West will see
a cooling trend to below normal highs as an upper trough reaches
the Northwest and clouds/rainfall expand over the Southwest.  The
central High Plains will see highs 5-10F or so above normal
Monday-Wednesday.

...The potential for flash flooding and severe weather continues
across portions of the Northern Plains and Midwest...

...Heavy rain and flooding possible for the Mid-Atlantic Friday...

...Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat continues
throughout much of the central and eastern United States, as well
as the Desert Southwest...

A persistent frontal system as well as a shortwave trough moving
across the Northern Tier of the U.S. will continue to lead to the
chance of heavy rain, flooding, and severe weather across portions
of the Northern Plains and Midwest. A quasi-stationary front
draped from the Lower Great Lakes westward through Nebraska should
begin to lift slowly northward as a warm front throughout the day
Friday. Widespread showers and thunderstorms are expected
overnight tonight along the boundary and will continue on Friday.
There is a Slight Risk (level 2 of 4) for excessive rainfall
Friday for portions of southeastern Minnesota and central
Wisconsin as another 2 to 4 inches of rain are expected on top of
the heavy rain that has already fallen. Additionally, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2 of 5) for
severe weather for northern Iowa, southeastern Minnesota, and
central Wisconsin as isolation south of the boundary will help
support more robust thunderstorms with the threat of large hail
and high winds. The shortwave approaching from the west on Friday
will also help to begin to push the frontal system eastward across
the Northern High Plains, and thunderstorms are expected to
develop along and ahead of the front. The Storm Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk of severe weather for portions of
southeastern Montana and the western Dakotas mainly for the threat
of large hail. As the shortwave and frontal system continue east,
thunderstorms are expected to develop again on Saturday with
another Slight Risk highlighted by the Storm Prediction Center for
portions of southern Minnesota into northwestern Wisconsin.

Further east, a cold front will push southward through the
Northeast on Friday and begin to stall across the Mid-Atlantic
Friday evening. There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall for
Friday from eastern Pennsylvania and northern Maryland east into
central and northern New Jersey. Showers and storms along the
boundary may produce a couple inches of rain over a region with
recently saturated soils due to heavy rain from Henri. Showers and
storms will continue on Saturday as the front remains
quasi-stationary.

Heat will also be a major story throughout the forecast period.
Ahead of the fronts, highs in the mid- to upper 90s are forecast
from the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas west through the Ohio Valley,
Mississippi Valley, and into the Central Plains on both Friday and
Saturday. High humidity will lead to heat indices closer to 100.
Temperatures will also rise into the 90s over the Great Lakes
region on Saturday. There will be little relief from the heat at
night as lows are expected to remain well above normal and only
fall into the low to mid-70s. In the Desert Southwest, highs in
the 110s are expected on Friday, and an Excessive Heat Warning
remains in effect for the area through Friday evening. The high
temperatures will cool a little on Saturday but still generally be
in the upper 100s to lower 110s.

Elsewhere, showers and storms are likely along the Gulf Coast as
moisture increases ahead of T.D. Nine, which is forecast by the
National Hurricane Center to move northwestward into the Gulf of
Mexico. Some Monsoonal showers and storms are also possible across
Arizona and New Mexico on Saturday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 AM CDT Fri Aug 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will remain across the northern Rockies today.
Strong mid-level winds will impact parts of southern Idaho into
Wyoming. As the trough moves slowly eastward, surface high pressure
will build into the Northwest.

...Wyoming...
Strong mid-level winds will combine with deepening surface low
pressure in the High Plains to bring 15-20 mph wind across southern
and eastern Wyoming. Fuels are not overly dry in these areas, but
the strength of the surface winds and 10-20% RH will elevate fire
weather concerns during the afternoon.

...Northern California...
The surface high pressure building in the Northwest will drive
downslope winds into parts of the western Sacramento Valley.
Mid-level winds will not be favorably aligned with the Valley.
Locally elevated to near critical fire weather is still possible
from late morning in potentially mid-afternoon. Elevated conditions
are limited in space. No highlights will be added at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CDT Fri Aug 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak, shortwave ridging aloft will occur across the Northwest and
northern Rockies on Saturday. Lack of stronger winds at mid-levels
and at the surface will generally keep fire weather concerns to a
minimum. Early in the period, remaining breezy, northerly winds into
the Sacramento Valley may pose some concern for brief elevated
conditions. Along with the short duration, marginal RH values
preclude highlights.

...Tropical Storm "Ida" to Intensify to Hurricane with Central
Gulf Coast Landfall Monday and a Heavy Rainfall/Runoff threat
spread from the South to Mid-Atlantic through Thursday...
...Tropical Storm "Nora" to also become Hurricane with Baja
California Landfall Monday with lead moisture to fuel a Southwest
U.S. Heavy Rain Threat mid-later next week...


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...
A composite of increasingly better clustered guidance of the
GFS/GEFS and ECMWF/ECENS along with the National Blend of Models
now seems to provide a good forecast starting point for the day
3-7 forecast period (Monday-next Friday) for much of the nation,
bolstering forecast confidence. In this period, the big story
concerns impending high impacts from Ida and Nora that are both
forecast to become hurricanes. Please refer to products from the
National Hurricane Center and your local offices to obtain the
latest information on these dangerous tropical systems.

...Pattern Overview with Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Tropical Storm Ida is expected to intensify to a hurricane to
landfall into the central Gulf Coast by Monday and provide a Heavy
Rainfall threat northeastward with steadily weakening but still
deeply moist system track from the South to the southern
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic through Thursday. Ida is likely to
bring rainfall totals of 8 to 16 inches with isolated maximum
amounts of 20 inches along the central Gulf Coast from southeast
Louisiana to coastal Mississippi and Alabama Sunday into Monday.
Ida is forecast to turn northeast as it moves inland with rainfall
totals of 4 to 8 inches possible across southern and central
Mississippi. This is likely to result in considerable flash,
urban, small stream, and riverine flooding. Moisture feeding
increasingly inland with time may also then interact with a
slowing front set to drape over-top the system to offer a lead
heavy rainfall focus.

Tropical Storm Nora is also forecast to become a Hurricane and
make landfall into Baja California with lead moisture to fuel a
Southwest U.S. Heavy Rain Threat next week. The latest track from
the NHC lift a weakening system northward across Baja to offer a
risk for lead associated moisture to enhance rainfall mid-later
next week into the Southwest U.S. with max potential over favored
Arizona terrain.

Elsewhere, northern stream upper trough and lower atmospheric
frontal system progression across the Northeast quarter of the
country early next week will support a period with locally
enhanced rain. Additional upper troughing well upstream will
meanwhile dig a wavy but only modestly unsettling/cooling front
down from the Northwest. Subsequent system progressions and
genesis mid-later next week out across the Rockies to the
north-central U.S. will increasingly focus an enhanced
convection/rainfall pattern that could focus locally heavy
convection/rainfall.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern High Plains/Northern Plains and over the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes and parts of the
northern Mid-Atlantic through Saturday morning...

... Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat throughout much
of the Southwest...

... Tropical Storm IDA is forecast to intensify moving toward the
Central Gulf Coast, having amongst other hazards, there will be a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall on Sunday...

A front extending from the Northeast westward to the Northern High
Plains will be quasi-stationary through Saturday. A wave of low
pressure over the Northern High Plains moves to the Upper
Mississippi Valley by Saturday evening and into South-Central
Canada by Sunday morning. Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and near the boundary from the Northern High Plains to the
Great Lakes.  The SPC has issued two Slight Risk areas of severe
thunderstorms along the front over parts of the Northern High
Plains/Northern Plains and over the Upper/Middle Mississippi
Valley through Saturday morning.  The hazards associated with
these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The severe thunderstorm
threat continues over the Upper Midwest on Saturday into Sunday
morning.

Furthermore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall along the front, over parts of the Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes.  Heavy rain associated with
the thunderstorms will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable through Saturday morning.  The excessive rainfall
threat decreases slightly on Saturday into Sunday.  Farther east
along the front over the Northeast/northern Mid-Atlantic, another
region of showers and thunderstorms will develop as moisture pools
along the boundary. The showers and thunderstorms will produce
areas of heavy rain.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable
through Saturday morning. The excessive rainfall threat decreases
slightly over this area on Saturday into Sunday, too.

Elsewhere, upper-level impulses and diurnal heating will produce
showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Southwest into the
Southern High Plains from the late afternoon into the late evening
on Friday and Saturday.  Meanwhile, tropical moisture and
upper-level impulses will produce showers and thunderstorms along
the Gulf Coast into the Southeast on Friday and Saturday.

Additionally, heat will also produce hazards. Heat Advisories are
posted over parts of New England and parts of the Middle
Mississippi and Western Ohio Valleys, where high temperatures are
forecast in the mid-to-upper 90s. Moreover, many areas from parts
of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic to the Midwest will have the
possibility of record high minimum temperatures on Friday and
Saturday morning. In the Southwest, highs in the 110s are expected
on Friday, and an Excessive Heat Warning remains in effect for the
area through Friday evening. The high temperatures will cool a
little on Saturday but generally be in the upper 100s to lower
110s.

Tropical Storm IDA, currently forecast to move northwestward
across the Gulf of Mexico, heading toward the Central Gulf Coast
by Sunday. Check with the NHC=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs latest bulletin for the mo=
st
up-to-date track and intensity of IDA.  IDA will produce heavy
rain over parts of the Central Gulf Coast on Sunday. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall for the
heavy rain over the region lasting into Monday morning. The heavy
rain will create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore,
many streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers from
through Monday morning.

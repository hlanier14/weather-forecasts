Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1141 AM CDT Mon Mar 28 2022

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
THE WESTERN OK/TX PANHANDLES...

The forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments were made
based on the latest observations and high-resolution guidance. For
details, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman.. 03/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Mar 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
...Northern South Carolina, North Carolina, and Virginia...
A strong mid-level jet streak will move from the Great Lakes to the
western Atlantic today. This strong mid-level flow is expected to
overspread a region of deep mixing east of the Appalachians. In this
region, relative humidity in the mid teens to low 20s is expected.
In addition, sustained wind speeds of 15 mph (localized 20) are
expected from northern South Carolina into the Mid-Atlantic.
However, temperatures will be too cool across northern Virginia and
northward to support a fire weather threat.

...Eastern Wyoming into southwest South Dakota and the Nebraska
Panhandle...
Lee troughing will amplify during the day today which will tighten
the pressure gradient across the Plains and High Plains. This may
lead to some elevated to locally critical wind speeds across eastern
Wyoming and into southwest South Dakota and the Nebraska Panhandle
where relative humidity is also expected to be 8 to 13 percent.

...Southern High Plains...
The surface pressure gradient will tighten through the day Monday as
lee troughing amplifies in the central Plains. However, the stronger
sustained wind speeds (greater than 20 mph) are not expected until
later in the afternoon when strong mid-level flow overspreads a very
dry airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains (5-10
percent RH). A broad region of elevated conditions is expected with
critical conditions across northeast New Mexico and adjacent areas
of the OK/TX Panhandles.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND
CENTRAL PLAINS...

***OUTBREAK OF DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER CONDITIONS POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS***

An expansive area of high-end critical fire-weather conditions is
expected across parts of the southern and central Plains during the
afternoon and early evening hours. Current indications are that the
greatest potential for near-extremely critical conditions and a
significant fire-weather episode will develop over portions of the
northern TX Panhandle, northwest OK and the OK Panhandle, and
southwest/south-central KS. Here, sustained southwesterly surface
winds of 30-35 mph (gusts upwards of 60 mph) will coincide with
10-15 percent RH during the afternoon and early evening. An upgrade
to Extremely Critical for this area remains possible with subsequent
outlooks, especially if RH trends lower than currently expected and
fine fuels substantially dry out today.

During the evening into the overnight hours, sustained northerly
surface winds of 20-30 mph behind a southward-advancing cold front
will have the potential to redirect any ongoing fires across the
central and southern Plains.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Mon Mar 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
A significant fire weather episode is anticipated across portions of
the southern High Plains into Southwest Kansas Tuesday afternoon.

A cyclone with a surface pressure at or below 990mb will develop
somewhere in the central Plains on Tuesday. This will tighten the
pressure gradient across the Plains. However, in addition, a 75 kt
mid-level jet streak will nose into the region Tuesday afternoon.
This will provide additional support for strengthening wind speeds
Tuesday afternoon, especially across the Texas Panhandle. Sustained
winds of 30 to 35 mph are likely from eastern New Mexico into the
TX/OK Panhandles and into southwest Kansas. Some wind gusts in
excess of 60 mph are likely. Despite a synoptic setup and wind
speeds which could support an extremely critical delineation,
low-level moisture will likely preclude the need for an extremely
critical. Most guidance forecasts dewpoints in the 20s to low 30s
which yields relative humidity in the 18 to 25 percent range. This
is dry enough to support a critical delineation, but is too high to
support an extremely critical area. Poor overnight recoveries on
Monday night from northeast New Mexico into the TX/OK Panhandles
should further prime the fuels for Tuesday in this region.

However, despite not having sufficient meteorological evidence to
support an extremely critical delineation, the pattern still remains
very favorable for large-fire spread on Tuesday. An expansive region
of very strong winds where fuels remain dormant in a region
experiencing D2-D4 drought is a recipe for numerous starts and the
potential for fires to quickly spread. Additionally, if guidance
trends drier, an extremely critical delineation may still be
necessary.

...A deep cyclone will likely move across the Great Lakes with
high winds, gradually departing wrap-around snows, areas of heavy
rain and possibly severe weather along the East Coast on
Thursday...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest model guidance this morning continues with the recent trend
of lifting a deep cyclone faster across the Great Lakes as the
medium-range period starts on Thursday morning.  This northward
trend not only resulted in a faster passage of the cyclone center
across the Great Lakes but also lifted the heavy rainfall axis in
the warm sector farther north from northern Florida into the
coastal plains of the Southeast.  There is also a continued model
tendency to push the cold front slightly faster off the East Coast
on Friday.

Behind the departing cyclone, the next upper trough over the
Pacific is forecast to penetrate farther inland through the
Pacific Northwest.  Models have generally abandoned the previous
idea of deepening this trough over the Southwest but rather, glide
it steadily east-southeast through the western U.S. into the
central/southern Plains by the weekend.  This pattern would favor
the formation of a frontal wave/clipper system over the central
Plains by the weekend.  Models have generally shown better
agreement today regarding the timing of this clipper system, with
a tendency to converge toward the ECMWF, which is in between the
slower CMC and the faster GFS.  By late in the weekend, model
consensus continues to suggest that the clipper will move across
the Southeast and then exit into the Atlantic.  There was a faster
trend in the models to push the clipper off the coast, which
resulted in a potentially heavy rainfall axis to be nudged farther
south along the central and eastern Gulf Coast earlier during the
weekend.  Meanwhile, models have shown very good agreement on a
steady increase of moisture to reach the Pacific Northwest late
this weekend.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were composed based on a composite
blend of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS and 20% from the
00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Less of the GFS was used on Day 5 to allow a
slower progression of the clipper system.  The blend then
transition to mostly a consensus of the ensemble
means by Day 7.  The results compare well with WPC continuity,
with reasonable timing discrepancy on frontal positions on Day 7.


...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone is set to lift from the Great Lakes to eastern
Canada Thursday into Friday, offering a threat for wrapping heavy
snows north of the low track.  High winds appear likely on the
backside of the cyclone on Thursday across the upper Midwest,
especially along the south shore of Lake Superior.  In the warm
sector, pre-frontal convection will likely sweep across the
Eastern Seaboard on Thursday along with a severe weather threat
focus over the Mid-Atlantic as per SPC while a heavy rainfall
threat should extend from northern Florida through the coastal
plains of Georgia and the Carolinas.

A protracted series of more modest upstream upper trough energies
and frontal systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through
the West later week into next week could each provide an
opportunity for enhanced rounds of wintry weather, mainly for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies.  Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend/early next week would
favor return moisture into a wavy frontal pattern off the Gulf
Coast.  This may support a heavy rainfall focus from the Gulf
Coast states to the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic.  By early next week
there is also a guidance signal to bring more energetic Pacific
flow toward the West Coast in two streams to be monitored.

SYNOPSIS: A strong storm system is forecast to intensify over the Great Pla=
ins
and move northeastward toward the Great Lakes and Northeast during the firs=
t
half of week-2. Heavy rainfall and an increased potential for river floodin=
g
are expected with this system across the southern Mississippi Valley and pa=
rts
of the Southeast. Strong northwesterly winds following the passage of this
system will bring colder air and the risk of high winds to parts of the
eastern
lower 48 during the latter half of week-2. Across the Northern Tier states,=
 a
fast-moving low pressure system could bring high winds to parts of the
Northern
High Plains early in the period. Farther east, snow melt coupled with near =
to
above-normal temperatures increases the risk of flooding near the Red River
along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. In Alaska, a strong storm system i=
n
the Gulf of Alaska early in week-2 is likely to bring high winds to parts o=
f
the southeastern Mainland and the Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for parts of the central and
eastern U.S., Sat-Sun, Apr 9-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the southeastern U.S., Tue-T=
hu,
Apr 5-7.

Slight risk of high winds for the Northern High Plains, Tue-Wed, Apr 5-6.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the eastern U.S., Sat-Mon, Apr 9-11.

Slight risk of high winds southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle,
Tue-Wed, Apr 5-6.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible in the Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeas=
t.

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 05 - MONDAY APRIL 11: Models agree well with the
amplification of mid-level low pressure over the central CONUS near the
beginning of week-2. However, there is some uncertainty regarding the
evolution
of the long-wave pattern during the first half of the period, with respect =
to
the speed and strength of the mid-level features, with the ECMWF ensemble
long-wave pattern being slightly more progressive and amplified than the GE=
FS.
Despite these differences, the surface temperature and precipitation fields
remain in decent agreement with respect to regions where the most hazardous
conditions may occur. As the storm system over the central CONUS amplifies =
and
moves eastward during the first half of the period, heavy rainfall is expec=
ted
along a trailing frontal boundary across portions of the southeastern CONUS=
. A
slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted Apr 5-7 across the Lower
Mississippi Valley and parts of the Southeast, where the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance for rainfall to exce=
ed
the 85th percentile of the historical distribution and 1 inch over the 3-da=
y
period. The GEFS and Canadian raw ensemble guidance indicate the potential =
for
some locations to receive in excess of 2 inches of rainfall for some
locations.



As the storm system exits the eastern U.S. during the middle of the period,
cold air and strong winds are forecast in the days that follow. A slight ri=
sk
of much below-normal temperatures is posted Apr 9-10 across parts of the
Southeast, the Ozarks, and the Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys.
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance of
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the historical distributi=
on
and 40=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF. Some areas of the Ohio River Valley also have at=
 least a 20 percent
chance of sub-freezing minimum temperatures during this time. In addition t=
o
the slight risk of hazardous cold temperatures, a slight risk of high winds=
 is
warranted Apr 9-11 across much of the eastern CONUS from the Mississippi
Valley
to the East Coast, and from the Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic to the Gulf
Coast.
The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20 percent chance for winds
speeds to exceed the 85th percentile throughout the slight risk area, with
probabilities exceeding 30 percent over parts of the southern Appalachians
during the 3-day period. A slight risk of high winds is also issued for par=
ts
of the Northern High Plains Apr 5-6, associated with a surface low progress=
ing
across southern Canada, enhancing downslope flow. Reforecast tools also
indicate at least a 20 percent chance for wind speeds to exceed the 85th
percentile for the slight risk area across the north-central U.S.



Rainfall totals have exceeded 6 inches since the middle of March across man=
y
areas of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, with some locations
picking up more than 10 inches of rain, which has already resulted in some
minor river flooding. With additional heavy precipitation forecast (more th=
an
2
inches for several locations) during week-1 and the slight risk of heavy
precipitation during the first half of week-2, flooding will be possible
throughout week-2 period in the highlighted areas. Flooding is also possibl=
e
along the Red River of the north, where snow-melt is likely to continue, du=
e
to
near to above-normal temperatures during week-2.



Although not reaching hazardous thresholds, given the time of year, amplifi=
ed
mid-level ridging during the middle of week-2 could result in much above-
normal
daytime high temperatures across the Desert Southwest and the Central Valle=
y
of
California. GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 40 percent
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile of the
climatological distribution for many locations. Across parts of the Desert
Southwest, there is also at least 20 percent chance for temperatures to exc=
eed
95=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF Apr 8-9.



In Alaska, a slight risk of high winds is posted for the southeastern Mainl=
and
and Panhandle Apr 5-6, associated with a strong low pressure system in the
Gulf
of Alaska early in the period. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 perc=
ent
chance for wind speeds to exceed the 85th percentile, with the ECMWF
reforecast
tool indicating some locations having greater than a 40 percent chance for
winds speeds to exceed the 85th percentile. The orientation of the surface
flow
could also result in locally higher wind speeds (upwards of 40 mph) near
coastal areas and in the channels, due to orographic enhancement.

it steadily east-southeast through the western U.S. into the
central/southern Plains by the weekend.  This pattern would favor
the formation of a frontal wave/clipper system over the central
Plains by the weekend.  Models have generally shown better
agreement today regarding the timing of this clipper system, with
a tendency to converge toward the ECMWF, which is in between the
slower CMC and the faster GFS.  By late in the weekend, model
consensus continues to suggest that the clipper will move across
the Southeast and then exit into the Atlantic.  There was a faster
trend in the models to push the clipper off the coast, which
resulted in a potentially heavy rainfall axis to be nudged farther
south along the central and eastern Gulf Coast earlier during the
weekend.  Meanwhile, models have shown very good agreement on a
steady increase of moisture to reach the Pacific Northwest late
this weekend.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were composed based on a composite
blend of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS and 20% from the
00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Less of the GFS was used on Day 5 to allow a
slower progression of the clipper system.  The blend then
transition to mostly a consensus of the ensemble
means by Day 7.  The results compare well with WPC continuity,
with reasonable timing discrepancy on frontal positions on Day 7.


...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone is set to lift from the Great Lakes to eastern
Canada Thursday into Friday, offering a threat for wrapping heavy
snows north of the low track.  High winds appear likely on the
backside of the cyclone on Thursday across the upper Midwest,
especially along the south shore of Lake Superior.  In the warm
sector, pre-frontal convection will likely sweep across the
Eastern Seaboard on Thursday along with a severe weather threat
focus over the Mid-Atlantic as per SPC while a heavy rainfall
threat should extend from northern Florida through the coastal
plains of Georgia and the Carolinas.

A protracted series of more modest upstream upper trough energies
and frontal systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through
the West later week into next week could each provide an
opportunity for enhanced rounds of wintry weather, mainly for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies.  Potential system
amplitude and progression into next weekend/early next week would
favor return moisture into a wavy frontal pattern off the Gulf
Coast.  This may support a heavy rainfall focus from the Gulf
Coast states to the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic.  By early next week
there is also a guidance signal to bring more energetic Pacific
flow toward the West Coast in two streams to be monitored.

...A deep cyclone will likely move across the Great Lakes with
high winds, gradually departing wrap-around snows, areas of heavy
rain and possibly severe weather along the East Coast on
Thursday...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest model guidance this morning continues with the recent trend
of lifting a deep cyclone faster across the Great Lakes as the
medium-range period starts on Thursday morning.  This northward
trend not only resulted in a faster passage of the cyclone center
across the Great Lakes but also lifted the heavy rainfall axis in
the warm sector farther north from northern Florida into the
coastal plains of the Southeast.  There is also a continued model
tendency to push the cold front slightly faster off the East Coast
on Friday.

Behind the departing cyclone, the next upper trough over the
Pacific is forecast to penetrate farther inland through the
Pacific Northwest.  Models have generally abandoned the previous
idea of deepening this trough over the Southwest but rather, glide
it steadily east-southeast through the western U.S. into the
central/southern Plains by the weekend.  This pattern would favor
the formation of a frontal wave/clipper system over the central
Plains by the weekend.  Models have generally shown better
agreement today regarding the timing of this clipper system, with
a tendency to converge toward the ECMWF, which is in between the
slower CMC and the faster GFS.  By late in the weekend, model
consensus continues to suggest that the clipper will move across
the Southeast and then exit into the Atlantic.  There was a faster
trend in the models to push the clipper off the coast, which
resulted in a potentially heavy rainfall axis to be nudged farther
south along the central and eastern Gulf Coast earlier during the
weekend.  Meanwhile, models have shown very good agreement on a
steady increase of moisture to reach the Pacific Northwest late
this weekend.

The WPC medium-range forecasts were composed based on a composite
blend of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS and 20% from the
00Z CMC/CMC mean.  Less of the GFS was used on Day 5 to allow a
slower progression of the clipper system.  The blend then
transition to mostly a consensus of the ensemble
means by Day 7.  The results compare well with WPC continuity,
with reasonable timing discrepancy on frontal positions on Day 7.


...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone is set to lift from the Great Lakes to eastern

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon March 28 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 03 - 07 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles are i=
n relative agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa height pattern over North America during the 6-10 day
period.
A trough is predicted in all ensemble means over the Aleutians extending in=
to
the North Pacific, with a ridge downstream to the west of the CONUS. The ri=
dge
and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast to push eastward into th=
e
western CONUS during the period. Ensemble means generally depict troughing =
and
weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the CONUS to the east of the
ridge,
with some differences in the orientation of this troughing between the vari=
ous
ensemble means. The manual blend of model 500-hPa heights favors negative
height anomalies over all of Alaska, positive height anomalies from the
Pacific
Coast approximately to the Rocky Mountains, and weak negative height anomal=
ies
over most of the CONUS to the east of the Rockies.

Above normal temperatures are favored for southwestern and southern central
areas of the Alaska Mainland, under predominately southerly flow. Below nor=
mal
temperatures are slightly favored across northern Alaska, under below norma=
l
500-hPa heights and anomalously easterly flow. Near to below normal
temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle, extending into the Pacif=
ic
Northwest, influenced by the trough over the North Pacific, with significan=
t
differences among model temperature tools. Above normal temperatures are
favored for much of the western CONUS extending across southern areas of Te=
xas
and the northern High Plains, with rising mid-level heights ahead of the
predicted ridge. Above normal temperatures are also favored for parts of th=
e
eastern Gulf Coast, southern Georgia, and Florida, as well as parts of
northern
New England, consistent with dynamical model temperature tools. Near to bel=
ow
normal temperatures are favored for remaining areas of the central and east=
ern
CONUS, under relatively weak 500-hPa height anomalies.

The probabilities of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced acros=
s
the southern Alaska Mainland, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of the Pacifi=
c
Northwest, ahead of the trough over the North Pacific. Below normal
precipitation is favored for central and northern California into parts of
Nevada and Oregon, under the predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation is
slightly favored over a large area of the central and eastern CONUS, exclud=
ing
parts of the eastern Great Lakes region and New England, under weak troughi=
ng
and supported by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by uncertainty associated with weak mean mid-level
height anomalies across the central and eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 05 - 11 2022

Dynamical model forecasts for the 500-hPa height pattern for week-2 remain =
in
relative agreement and consistent overall with the 6-10 day period forecast=
,
with greater uncertainty among models and relatively weak anomalies over mu=
ch
of the forecast domain. A trough persists but weakens over the North Pacifi=
c
to
the south of the Aleutians, while a ridge and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies
amplify and push further eastward over the western CONUS in the week 2 peri=
od.
Weak negative 500-hPa height anomalies remain over much of the eastern half=
 of
the CONUS in the week-2 manual blend.

Below normal temperatures continue to be slightly favored across the northe=
rn
Alaska Mainland in week-2, under anomalously easterly flow. Above normal
temperatures are slightly favored for parts of the southern Alaska Mainland=
,
under southerly flow. The probabilities for above normal temperatures are
increased across most of the West in week-2, under the amplifying ridge. Ne=
ar
to below normal temperatures are favored over most of the eastern CONUS und=
er
slightly below average 500-hPa heights, with greater probabilities of below
normal temperatures from the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley to the Oh=
io
Valley, consistent with dynamical model temperature tools. Above normal
temperatures continue to be favored for the Florida Peninsula and parts of =
the
Northeast, consistent with the dynamical temperature forecasts.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the southeastern Alaska
Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, ahead of a predicted trough. Near to bel=
ow
normal precipitation is favored over the West, under the increased influenc=
e
of
a predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation continues to be favored for t=
he
Southern Plains, the Northern Plains, and east of the Mississippi, under a
weak
trough and slightly below average 500-hPa heights.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
relatively good model agreement, offset by continued uncertainty associated
with weak mean mid-level height anomalies over the eastern CONUS.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Record cold for portions of the upper Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast Tuesday morning...

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible from the
central to southern Plains into the middle and lower Mississippi
Valleys Tuesday night into Wednesday...

...Critical Risk of fire weather for the southern to central High
Plains...

As an upper level low departs from the Northeast tonight,
scattered snow showers will dissipate as high pressure settles in
from the west. Well below average temperatures across the upper
Ohio Valley and Northeast will continue into Tuesday morning where
record cold minimum temperatures are expected Tuesday morning,
extending from the upper Ohio Valley into the East Coast between
eastern Virginia and southern New England. Temperatures will
moderate into the middle of the week but remain below average over
the Northeast through Wednesday, to the north of an advancing warm
front.

A large closed upper level low just off of the coast of California
will drive much of the impactful weather over the lower 48 heading
into the middle of the week. Locally heavy rain along the central
to southern coast of California will come to an end tonight as the
upper level system and associated cold front move into the Desert
Southwest. Scattered showers and higher elevation heavy snow will
spread across the Intermountain West through Tuesday while high
temperatures out ahead of the upper level system remain above
average into the 70s and 80s across the Great Plains. Warm
temperatures and low moisture values will favor the threat for the
spreading of wildfires. SPC has portions of the southern and
central Great Plains in a threat for Elevated to Critical
fire-weather conditions for the rest of today into Tuesday, mainly
behind a dryline forecast over western Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.

As the upper level system tracks east late Tuesday into Wednesday,
favorable upper level dynamics will meet with increasing amounts
of low level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico to support the
development of what is likely to be a south to north axis of
thunderstorms stretching from portions of central Texas into
Oklahoma and southern Kansas. The line of strong to severe
thunderstorms will track east late Tuesday night into Wednesday,
bringing the potential for tornadoes, large hail, damaging
straight-line winds and flash flooding. Temperatures will drop
significantly in the wake of the cold front as it tracks eastward
into the Mississippi Valley on Wednesday. On the north side of the
storm system, winter weather is expected with light snow
accumulations across the north-central U.S. along with a mixture
of snow, sleet and freezing rain across the Great Lakes region
into parts of the Allegheny Plateau and Northeast.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN TEXAS
PANHANDLE INTO SOUTHWEST KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS INTO NORTHERN KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
...A Significant Wildfire Outbreak is Likely Across the Southern
High Plains...

A strong upper-level jet streak will advance from the Southwest into
the southern High Plains today. The core of this jet streak will
extend from southeast New Mexico into southwest Kansas this
afternoon with 500mb flow from 70 to 90 knots. In addition, a strong
surface low will deepen across western Kansas and move into northern
Kansas by this evening. This surface low will lead to strong surface
winds in excess of 20 mph for most of the southern and Central
Plains. Even stronger winds are expected beneath this mid-level jet
streak. This jet streak will clear any residual cloud cover as it
ejects into the Plains, which will allow for strong surface heating
at the surface. The environment across the TX Panhandle has very
poor relative-humidity recovery this morning and the airmass remains
well mixed. Therefore, it won't take much heating for very deep
mixing to occur and for some of this stronger flow to reach the
surface. Sustained winds in excess of 30 mph may begin by
mid-morning with increasing winds and lowering relative humidity
through the day. By the afternoon, a broad region of 12 to 18
percent relative humidity and sustained winds of 35 to 40 mph with
gusts 65 to 70 mph are expected from the Texas Panhandle into
central Kansas. Extremely critical meteorological conditions will
likely extend as far as north-central Kansas, but fuels are somewhat
less favorable with northern and eastern extent.

Expanded the elevated delineation as far east as 40 to 45 percent
relative humidity. Despite the higher relative humidity, winds will
be sustained 25 to 30 mph. Numerous fires have occurred in the past
48 hours, indicating fuels are sufficiently dry for large fire
spread.

A cold front will move through the extremely critical area between
06 and 10Z, which will lead to a 90 degree wind shift from southwest
to northwest. This will likely have a significant impact on any
ongoing fires, especially considering sustained winds of 25 to 30
mph are expected in the post-frontal airmass.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered guidance from the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF and
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models days 3-5 (Friday-Sunday). Embedded smaller scale system
differences and ample run to run continuity variances remain
problematic despite reasonably similar larger scale pattern
evolutions. Opted to blend just the generally compatible ensemble
means by early next week to mitigate the less predictable forecast
components amid steadily growing forecast spread. Overall, WPC
product continuity is reasonably maintained with this strategy and
the forecast seems in line with a similar composite of newer 00
UTC guidance.

...Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A deep cyclone will eject across a stormy eastern Canada Friday as
high winds and some wrapping snows persist to the lee of the Great
Lakes and across the Northeast on the backside of the cyclone. A
trailing front will sweep off the East Coast, but should stall and
linger over Florida, the Gulf of Mexico/Gulf Coast and into
northern Mexico.

Upstream, a series of progressive upper troughs and frontal
systems forecast to dig with some uncertainty through the West
late week into early next week could each provide an opportunity
for periods of modest wintry weather across the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies. System progressions downstream within
an emerging southern stream may meanwhile favor modest
precipitation from the central Plains and Midwest to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic, but deeper return moisture focus into
wavy fronts and a stalled lead front offers potential to fuel some
heavy downpours from the Gulf Coast to the Southeast into the
weekend.

By early next week there is also a growing guidance signal to
bring more energetic Pacific jet flow toward the West Coast. This
may transport deeper moisture to fuel and emerging precipitation
pattern focus into the Pacific Northwest to include heavy terrain
enhancing snows.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN TEXAS FROM THE BIG BEND
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
...South Texas...
A mid-level trough will move into the Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday with a mid-level jet streak extending from the Great Lakes
to southern New Mexico. 50+ knots of mid-level westerly flow will
persist across Texas for most of the day. A dry and well-mixed
airmass will be in place across Texas in the wake of the cold front,
which will allow some of the stronger mid-level flow to make it to
the surface. Therefore, sustained winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected
from the Big Bend to the Gulf of Mexico with relative humidity of 13
to 18 percent.

Fuels are very concerning across south Texas. ERC values are near
the 95 to 98th percentile across most of south Texas with some areas
at record dryness. Therefore, concern for fire spread is even larger
than a typical critical event. In fact, if surface winds trend
somewhat stronger in later outlooks, an extremely critical
delineation may need to be added.

...Southeast into the Ohio Valley...
Southerly flow will strengthen on Wednesday across much of the
eastern CONUS as a strong surface low moves into the Great Lakes.
This southerly flow will bring an increase in low-level moisture to
the Mississippi Valley and the lower Ohio Valley, but a very dry
airmass will remain Wednesday afternoon from eastern Indiana south
into eastern Tennessee and Georgia. Therefore, an overlap in dry and
windy conditions is expected across a broad region. Sustained winds
will range from 15 to 30 mph across the region with relative
humidity 20 to 35 percent.

Eventually, low-level moisture will increase in these regions after
dark with the potential for thunderstorms and even some severe
weather on Wednesday night. This rainfall is expected to be
widespread and should help control any fires which develop in the
region.

...Severe thunderstorms and excessive rainfall threat on Tuesday
into Thursday morning...

...Much below-average temperatures are expected from the Great
Lakes into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic, with records low
temperatures possible on Tuesday...

...There is an Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern High Plains on Tuesday...

A deep upper-level trough over the Great Lakes to the Northeast
moves eastward, which will allow temperatures to be 10 to 20
degrees below average over the region. As a result, the Tuesday s
morning low temperatures will be a record or tied for a record low
temperatures over several parts of the Great Lakes to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast, which will start to moderate during
the day.

Meanwhile, a broad, deep upper-level low over Southern California
to the Southwest on Tuesday will move steadily to the Mississippi
Valley/Great Lakes by Thursday. Therefore, scattered light rain
and higher elevation snow will develop over parts of Southern
California to the Rockies through Wednesday morning.

Furthermore, as the storm moves out of the Rockies overnight
Tuesday, moisture will begin to flow northward over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley. The moisture will aid in producing showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern Plains and parts
of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. Some of the thunderstorms
will become severe. Therefore, from Tuesday into Wednesday
morning, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over parts of the Central/Southern Plains and parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover, the WPC has issued a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over
the area on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

Furthermore, rain and snow will develop over parts of the Northern
Plains also overnight Tuesday. An area of light rain/freezing rain
will develop over a wide area from the Upper Mississippi Valley to
the Great Lakes and parts of the Central Appalachians overnight
Tuesday into Thursday. Likewise, snow and rain/freezing rain will
develop over parts of Northern New England overnight Wednesday
into Thursday morning.

Additionally, the threat of severe thunderstorms and excessive
rainfall increases from Wednesday into Thursday morning. As the
system moves eastward, the SPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys
and the Southeast on Wednesday into Thursday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Over the
Central Gulf Coast, Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys, and the
Southeast, there is an increased threat of EF2-EF5 tornadoes and
severe thunderstorm wind gusts of 65 knots or greater. Moreover,
due to the associated heavy rain, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk
of excessive rainfall over parts of the Tennessee Valley/Southeast
from Wednesday to Thursday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday
morning.

In addition, the SPC has issued an Extreme Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains Tuesday into
Wednesday morning due to strong gusty winds, low relative
humidity, and dry fuels. The threat reduces to a Critical Risk of
fire weather on Wednesday into Thursday morning over the southern
third of Texas.

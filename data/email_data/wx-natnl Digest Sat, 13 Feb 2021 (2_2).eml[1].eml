Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

1224 AM CST Sat Feb 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough across the Southwest will continue to broaden
as it moves into the southern Plains on Sunday. High pressure will
continue to impact the Plains into the Midwest. As with Saturday,
cold temperatures and precipitation will significantly limit fire
weather concerns across much of the U.S. Some dry/windy conditions
are possible in the lower Colorado River Valley with strong flow
along the back side of the Southwestern trough. Though RH could fall
near 15% with 15-25 mph winds, limited fuel availability and
marginal fuel moisture should limit overall concern.

...Extensive impacts from wintry weather to transpire from
coast-to-coast this weekend...

...Icy weather and slick travel conditions in the Mid-Atlantic
later today...

...Major winter storm to blanket the West and Plains in heavy snow
and significant ice accumulations...

...Frigid Arctic air and dangerously cold wind chills to persist
in the Heartland...

An intrusion of bitterly cold temperatures combined with an active
storm track emerging out of the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico will
lead to a myriad of winter weather hazards across the continental
U.S. this weekend. Starting in the East, areas of low pressure
riding along a quasi-stationary boundary off the Southeast coast
induce showers and thunderstorms from the Carolinas to Florida.
Flash Flood Watches are in effect for parts of the Florida
Panhandle and both southern Georgia and Alabama this weekend where
over 2" of rainfall is expected. Farther north, sub-freezing
temperatures support precipitation falling in the form of an icy
wintry mix. Winter Weather Advisories extend from northern North
Carolina to the Delaware Valley where ice accumulations as high as
a quarter inch are possible into Saturday evening. The worst
impacts are likely to be felt in central Virginia where Ice Storm
Warnings and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect through Saturday
night. Up to a half inch of ice is possible in these areas downed
tree limbs and power outages expected. Hazardous travel conditions
will be common throughout these areas of the Mid-Atlantic Saturday
night and into Sunday morning.

In the West, a major winter storm is unfolding as deep fetch of
Pacific moisture clashes with very cold temperatures from the
Pacific Northwest to the Intermountain West. Significant snow
accumulations are expected in western Washington and Oregon with
dangerously icy conditions also possible in the Willamette Valley
into midday Saturday. Heavy mountain snow is anticipated in the
higher elevations of the West on Saturday, including portions of
the Great Basin and some lower lying valleys as well. By Sunday, a
deepening upper trough over the Four Corners region and well below
normal temperatures entrenched throughout the Plains foster an
environment favorable for disruptive snow and ice accumulations in
the South-Central region. The central and southern Plains can
expect a snowy Sunday with blustery winds helping to cause
whiteout conditions and high snow drifts. The latest forecast
through Sunday night calls for as much as a foot of snow in parts
of Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. By Sunday night, an icy
wintry mix is forecast to set up from southern and eastern Texas
to the Lower Mississippi Valley. Travel conditions Sunday night
into Monday morning in these areas will be treacherous with some
roads becoming impossible to travel on safely. Look for
moderate-to-heavy snow to develop over the lower Great Lakes and
into the northern Mid-Atlantic by Monday morning. Winter Storm
Watches have been posted for parts of the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys in response to the growing threat for heavy snowfall and
dangerous ice accumulations.

On top of all the disruptive wintry weather and precarious travel
conditions, teeth-chattering cold continues across the Nation's
Heartland this weekend and into the first half of the upcoming
week. Numerous daily record low max temps are likely to be broken
from the Northwest to the Plains. High temperatures are forecast
to be in the single digits in the Central Plains and Midwest
today, then struggle to get above zero on Sunday. Actual low
temperatures in the northern Rockies and Plains are forecast to be
as cold as -30 degrees. Add in gusty winds and the result is
life-threatening wind chills between -30 to -60 in the
North-Central U.S. Wind Chill Advisories extend as far south as
the Southern Plains and look to persist into the start of the
work-week. Where are the warmest locations? In the Desert
Southwest and Florida with some areas of the "Sunshine State"
likely to witness highs in the 80s both days this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1133 AM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS...

The Critical area was nudged farther north into Southwest Nebraska.
The remainder of the forecast remains on track. See the previous
discussion below for more details.

..Wendt.. 04/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
An initial low-amplitude shortwave trough within westerly flow over
Coastal California will begin to rapidly deepen this morning ahead
of a potent 90 kt upstream jet streak. As heights aloft fall in
response to strong DCVA, a surface low will quickly deepen over the
Great Basin and western slopes of the central Rockies before it
shifts eastward onto the Plains late tonight. Breezy surface flow
over the Southwest and southern/central High Plains will overlap
with a very dry airmass and supportive fuels. Critical fire weather
potential appears likely.

...Southern High Plains...
Intensifying mid-level westerlies will gradually become more
southwesterly with time this morning as the upstream shortwave
trough deepens. Regional model soundings show deep inverted-v
profiles owing to strong diurnal mixing intersecting with 40 kt 500
mb flow. As the boundary layer deepens through the day, surface
winds will increase in response to downward momentum transport from
aloft. At the same time, the westerly flow will enhance lee
troughing bolstering west to east surface pressure gradients through
the afternoon. Hi-res guidance and model soundings show
high-confidence in sustained boundary-layer winds of 20-30 mph with
the potential for higher gusts, especially with western extent. With
a strong westerly component, downsloping trajectories will support
widespread RH below 15%. Fuels remain very receptive to fire spread
suggesting high confidence in Critical fire weather conditions this
afternoon. Some threat may linger overnight as the main trough and
jet eject eastward onto the Plains. Poor overnight recoveries are
expected, and while winds will likely slacken after dark, areas in
proximity to the higher terrain may retain near critical winds
overnight.

...Central High Plains...
Unlike areas farther south, low-level surface flow across the
central Plains will be dominated by tightening surface pressure
gradients ahead of the western surface low. Regardless, gusty
southeasterly surface winds are likely to develop by mid-morning in
response to the approaching low. Ahead of the surging Gulf moisture,
dry surface conditions with RH of 15-20% should be more than
sufficient for widespread Elevated and Critical fire weather
conditions as far north as NE. Surface RH may begin to increase
through the afternoon and in the evening on the eastern fringes of
the Elevated and Critical areas as moisture advection increases east
of the fast moving low. However, low-level flow is forecast to
remain quite strong suggesting some fire weather potential may
linger overnight given the exceptionally dry nature of area fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 11 2022

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, strong surface high pressure for April is likely to
result in another outbreak of anomalously cold temperatures across the central
and eastern U.S. Mid-level low pressure is forecast to strengthen over the
northeastern Pacific which could bring inclement weather to the Alaska
Panhandle and Pacific Northwest. Later in week-2, above-normal temperatures
are
expected to affect California and the desert Southwest.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures expanding southeast across
parts of the central and eastern U.S., Tue-Thu, Apr 19-21.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures expanding southeast across much
of the central and eastern U.S., Tue-Fri, Apr 19-22.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast,
Tue-Wed, Apr 19-20.

Slight risk of high winds for the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Mid-Atlantic,
Tue-Wed, Apr 19-20.

Slight risk of high winds for the Pacific Northwest and Alaska Panhandle,
Tue-Fri, Apr 19-22.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Pacific Northwest and southern
Alaska Panhandle, Tue-Fri, Apr 19-22.

Flooding possible along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of the
North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 14 - MONDAY APRIL 18:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pl6oqp9nbh83mvJI-XQ7M5CShyQrnlbaQYx0I_GjA2HKJwDfGrhZTIxCKDPmQDtVetgA5w5X$

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 19 - MONDAY APRIL 25: Ensemble means are in reasonably good
agreement and consistent that a low pressure system tracks across the
Northeast
on Apr 19 and 20. The ECMWF ensemble mean is slower than the GEFS with the
timing of this low pressure system. Regardless of these timing differences, a
slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for the Northeast. Given
predicted
thermal profiles, accumulating snow could occur at the higher elevations of
the
Central to Northern Appalachians. On the backside of the low pressure system,
a
slight risk of high winds covers the Great Lakes and Northeast due to a tight
pressure gradient and cold air advection.



Anomalous cold is likely to overspread the central and eastern U.S. next week
as surface high pressure shifts southeastward from the Northern Great Plains
and Midwest. A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures (Apr 19-21) is
posted for areas where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool depict minimum
temperatures having more than a 40 percent chance of minimum temperatures
falling below the 15th percentile of the climatological distribution. Compared
to earlier this month, a larger area of vegetation will be vulnerable to a
damaging freeze including the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Based on a
1991-2020 climatology, the median last date of a spring freeze across these
areas is early to mid-April. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate that
the Ohio Valley has at least a 40 percent chance of experiencing a freeze. The
ECMWF reforecast tool has the strongest signal for a frost extending southward
to the Piedmont areas of the Southeast where there is a 60 to 80 percent
chance
of minimum temperatures falling below 40 degrees F.



Tropical Storm Malakas, currently east of the Philippines, is forecast to
become a typhoon and then eventually recurve northeastward across the North
Pacific. Model solutions are in good agreement that the remnant low of this
tropical cyclone contributes to a strengthening of the 500-hPa trough over the
northeast Pacific. A slight risk of high winds and heavy precipitation are
forecast for parts of the Alaska Panhandle and parts of the Pacific Northwest
from Apr 19 to 22. The ECMWF model is most bullish with an increased risk of
an
atmospheric river reaching coastal northwest Oregon and Washington during this
time period.



Spring flooding continues along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of
the North. Moderate to heavy rain is forecast across the Midwest during the
next week, while heavy snow and rain are forecast throughout the Dakotas and
Minnesota. Based on the above-normal precipitation likely preceding week-2 and
forecasts from the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, a flooding possible
hazard is maintained for the Illinois River and Red River of the North through
week-2.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 PM EDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 14 2022 - 12Z Mon Apr 18 2022


...Overview...

A strong springtime low pressure system will depart from the Upper
Midwest as the period begins Thursday, with the attendant cold
front sliding through the East. Behind this storm, expect lower
amplitude mean flow aloft across the lower 48. Guidance generally
shows a shortwave progressing into/through the West during the
weekend and into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next week.
This feature may produce another round of precipitation over the
northern and eastern part of the country. Although there is some
agreement with the large scale pattern, there is still plenty of
uncertainty with respect to specific system/precipitation details
all the way from the West Coast into the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the updated forecast reflected a composite of
00Z/06Z model guidance. This tilted the blend somewhat slower than
the GFS for the entire sequence of northern stream features: low
pressure and supporting dynamics reaching the Pacific Northwest on
Thursday, the system departing from the Upper Midwest, and a weak
wave that may track offshore New England. This also provided an
intermediate (though slower than prior consensus) timing of the
next Pacific system reaching the West by Saturday. Guidance spread
for both West Coast systems would suggest below average confidence
in any specific solution. Toward Sunday-Monday the 00Z CMC
continues to be a fast/flat extreme with upper flow over the lower
48, requiring phasing out its contribution. The new 12Z CMC fits
the consensus better. Versus the flatter 00Z GEFS run, the 06Z
GEFS mean made a notable trend toward the western ridge and Plains
or east-central U.S. trough depicted in the 00Z ECMWF/CMC means.
ECMWF runs fall into this template but it remains to be seen if an
embedded deep closed low will evolve. GFS runs have tended to lean
a bit on the flatter side. Meanwhile 06Z/12Z GFS runs are somewhat
south/southeast of consensus for the trough/upper low reaching the
eastern Pacific by next Monday. These considerations led to
placing the greatest weight on the ensemble means and 00Z ECMWF
late in the period, reflecting the dominant guidance cluster while
toning down ECMWF specifics.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some lingering snow is possible across the Upper Midwest at the
start of Thursday, but the heaviest should be rapidly coming to an
end as the deep low departs into Canada. However gusty winds are
likely to continue into Friday with blowing and drifting of snow
and possible hazardous travel conditions. The storm's associated
cold front pushing through the East Thursday into Friday will
bring areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall. The best chance
for heavier totals should be across parts of the Southeast where
the better moisture and instability will be present. Rainfall
across the Southeast could linger into the weekend as the western
edge of the boundary stalls and then tries to lift north as a warm
front before weakening ahead of another approaching front. Out
West, a couple systems may bring rain/mountain snow to parts of
the Pacific Northwest and California into the northern Rockies
late this week into the weekend. Some of the activity from the
West Coast into the Cascades could be moderate to heavy but there
is considerable uncertainty over specifics of each system, so
confidence is lower than average for determining coverage/timing
of the most significant precipitation. Moisture should spread east
beyond the Rockies by next Sunday-Monday as low pressure/fronts
reach the central/eastern U.S. At least some precipitation across
the northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage.

Expect the core of below normal temperatures to persist across the
northern High Plains into early next week, with daytime highs
generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings (especially
for daytime highs) are possible late this week when some lingering
daily records for lows/cold highs are possible. Over the West,
Thursday-Saturday will feature chilly readings over the northern
half of the region (minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer
to normal temperatures farther south. An upper ridge building over
the region by the start of next week should bring northern
locations toward normal and southern areas moderately above
normal. Above normal temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard on
Thursday should return to near normal next weekend. The system
potentially reaching the East by next Monday could draw some of
the chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it,
with expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 11 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 17 - 21 2022

Today's model solutions are generally in good agreement on the overall
predicted large-scale 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America and
surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period. A trough and associated
negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the northeast Pacific.
Downstream, a ridge is predicted with associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the southwestern CONUS. A trough and associated negative 500-
hPa
height anomalies are forecast over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over most of the northwestern, central,
and eastern CONUS under predicted below normal 500-hPa heights and enhanced
northerly mid-level flow. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for
most of the southwestern CONUS, as a ridge is predicted to push into the
region
during the period. Near to below normal temperatures are likely over most of
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle underneath predicted near to below
normal 500-hPa heights, while above normal temperatures are favored over parts
of southwestern Alaska, due to forecast low-level southerly flow.

Above normal precipitation is favored for the eastern third of the CONUS, near
and ahead of  the predicted trough over eastern North America. Near to below
normal precipitation is favored over much of the southwestern CONUS, Great
Plains and parts of the western Great Lakes, consistent with the reforecast
tool. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored across the Alaska
Panhandle, while near to below normal precipitation is most likely over
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, supported by the precipitation dynamical
forecast tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and among
the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due to a
changing pattern.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 19 - 25 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the circulation pattern over the North American
region is generally consistent with an evolution of the predicted pattern for
the 6-10 day period, with increased uncertainty. A trough is predicted to
de-amplify over the northeastern Pacific, while the downstream ridge and
trough
are predicted to progress eastward over the CONUS. The 500-hPa circulation
pattern indicates positive 500-hPa height anomalies from the southwestern
Pacific Coast to approximately the southern Rocky Mountains and near normal
500-hPa heights are forecast  over most of the remainder of the CONUS.

Near to above normal temperatures are likely for much of the southwestern
CONUS
and parts of the central and southern High Plains, under near to above normal
500-hPa heights. Below normal temperatures are favored over most of the
remainder of the CONUS, associated with troughs and below normal 500-hPa
heights over the Pacific Northwest and the eastern CONUS, and consistent with
dynamical forecast tools. Elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures
are forecast for Alaska, supported by the dynamical model temperature tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the northeastern CONUS, due
to a predicted trough over the eastern CONUS. Near to below normal
precipitation is favored over much of the southwestern CONUS extending
eastward
into parts of the central High Plains, Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi
Valley and Tennessee Valley, consistent with the precipitation dynamical model
tools. Above normal precipitation is favored across southeastern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, while near to below normal precipitation is
likely for the remainder of Alaska, supported by the precipitation dynamical
forecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and
among the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due
to a changing pattern.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0213 PM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PERMIAN BASIN INTO
SOUTHWEST KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The primary changes to this outlook are to expand the Critical area
into more of southeast Colorado. Strong downslope winds and very low
RH is possible as the surface low shifts eastward during the
afternoon. The Extremely Critical area was also expanded southward
into the Permian Basin. Given the exceptionally dry fuels,
meteorological conditions will be sufficient for extreme fire
behavior. Dry and windy conditions are possible into the Nebraska
Panhandle and western/central South Dakota. However, RH remains
quite uncertain that far north. Trends will be monitored for
potential Elevated highlights.

..Wendt.. 04/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Mon Apr 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough and 80-90 kt mid-level jet streak will
quickly eject eastward out of the Rockies and over the Plains
Tuesday. As the trough takes on a prominent negative tilt, a sub-990
mb lee low will move quickly northeast across the central Plains
toward the upper Midwest. Trailing the low, a sharp dryline will
bisect the warm sector with hot and dry surface conditions expected
to its west. Within this zone, the overlap of strong unidirectional
flow through out the column will support widespread sustained winds
of 30-40 mph and frequent gusts to 50+ mph. Ongoing extreme drought
and exceptionally dry fuels will support Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions and the potential for a dangerous fire weather
outbreak.

...A significant fire weather outbreak is possible across the
southern and central High Plains Tuesday....

...Southern/Central High Plains...
As the upper trough ejects eastward over the central and northern
Plains Tuesday, very strong mid-level flow (80-90 kt) will
overspread an increasing warm and dry boundary layer west of the
dryline across the southern and central High Plains. Strong daytime
heating and subsidence beneath the ribbon of strong momentum aloft
will aid in the development of a prominent low-level thermal ridge
with temperatures reaching the low to mid 90s F from central KS
southwestward across western OK/TX. Coincident with the thermal
ridge, deep vertical mixing and the hot temperatures will support
very dry surface conditions with widespread surface RH below 10%. An
overlapping southwesterly low-level jet of 40-60 kts will bolster
flow already enhanced by the strong surface pressure trough/dryline
across western KS, TX and OK. Widespread sustained surface winds of
30-40 mph are expected with frequent gusts to 50-60 mph possible.

Conditions farther north into the central Plains may take somewhat
longer to develop Tuesday morning owing to lingering mid-level cloud
cover and a more diffuse moisture gradient. Closer to the surface
low, low-level mass response should be quite strong supporting
widespread winds of 25-40 mph within the drying airmass. Fuels are
less volatile with northern extent, but remain overall favorable for
large fire development/spread. High-end critical conditions appear
likely into eastern Nebraska with Elevated conditions possible
farther west where humidity is forecast to be higher.

Fuels across the Plains remain highly receptive to fire
starts/spread owing to severe drought and several preceding days of
Critically dry and windy conditions. ERC values in the 90-95th
percentile are ubiquitous across the southern High Plains setting
the stage for exceptionally volatile fire weather conditions. High
confidence exists in several hours of Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions developing beneath the 850-700 mb jet core from
west TX, through the Panhandles, western OK, and into western KS
where high-end parameter space for both meteorological conditions
and fuel states exists.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
330 PM EDT Mon Apr 11 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 14 2022 - 12Z Mon Apr 18 2022


...Overview...

A strong springtime low pressure system will depart from the Upper
Midwest as the period begins Thursday, with the attendant cold
front sliding through the East. Behind this storm, expect lower
amplitude mean flow aloft across the lower 48. Guidance generally
shows a shortwave progressing into/through the West during the
weekend and into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next week.
This feature may produce another round of precipitation over the
northern and eastern part of the country. Although there is some
agreement with the large scale pattern, there is still plenty of
uncertainty with respect to specific system/precipitation details
all the way from the West Coast into the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the updated forecast reflected a composite of
00Z/06Z model guidance. This tilted the blend somewhat slower than
the GFS for the entire sequence of northern stream features: low
pressure and supporting dynamics reaching the Pacific Northwest on
Thursday, the system departing from the Upper Midwest, and a weak
wave that may track offshore New England. This also provided an
intermediate (though slower than prior consensus) timing of the
next Pacific system reaching the West by Saturday. Guidance spread
for both West Coast systems would suggest below average confidence
in any specific solution. Toward Sunday-Monday the 00Z CMC
continues to be a fast/flat extreme with upper flow over the lower
48, requiring phasing out its contribution. The new 12Z CMC fits
the consensus better. Versus the flatter 00Z GEFS run, the 06Z
GEFS mean made a notable trend toward the western ridge and Plains
or east-central U.S. trough depicted in the 00Z ECMWF/CMC means.
ECMWF runs fall into this template but it remains to be seen if an
embedded deep closed low will evolve. GFS runs have tended to lean
a bit on the flatter side. Meanwhile 06Z/12Z GFS runs are somewhat
south/southeast of consensus for the trough/upper low reaching the
eastern Pacific by next Monday. These considerations led to
placing the greatest weight on the ensemble means and 00Z ECMWF
late in the period, reflecting the dominant guidance cluster while
toning down ECMWF specifics.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some lingering snow is possible across the Upper Midwest at the
start of Thursday, but the heaviest should be rapidly coming to an
end as the deep low departs into Canada. However gusty winds are
likely to continue into Friday with blowing and drifting of snow
and possible hazardous travel conditions. The storm's associated
cold front pushing through the East Thursday into Friday will
bring areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall. The best chance
for heavier totals should be across parts of the Southeast where
the better moisture and instability will be present. Rainfall
across the Southeast could linger into the weekend as the western
edge of the boundary stalls and then tries to lift north as a warm
front before weakening ahead of another approaching front. Out
West, a couple systems may bring rain/mountain snow to parts of
the Pacific Northwest and California into the northern Rockies
late this week into the weekend. Some of the activity from the
West Coast into the Cascades could be moderate to heavy but there
is considerable uncertainty over specifics of each system, so
confidence is lower than average for determining coverage/timing
of the most significant precipitation. Moisture should spread east
beyond the Rockies by next Sunday-Monday as low pressure/fronts
reach the central/eastern U.S. At least some precipitation across
the northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage.

Expect the core of below normal temperatures to persist across the
northern High Plains into early next week, with daytime highs
generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings (especially
for daytime highs) are possible late this week when some lingering
daily records for lows/cold highs are possible. Over the West,
Thursday-Saturday will feature chilly readings over the northern
half of the region (minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer
to normal temperatures farther south. An upper ridge building over
the region by the start of next week should bring northern
locations toward normal and southern areas moderately above
normal. Above normal temperatures along the Eastern Seaboard on
Thursday should return to near normal next weekend. The system
potentially reaching the East by next Monday could draw some of
the chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it,
with expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies.

...Major winter storm to bring heavy snow to the Intermountain
West and blizzard conditions for parts of the northern Plains
tonight into Thursday...

...Threats for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding exist
across eastern portions of the central to southern Plains into the
Mississippi Valley through Tuesday night...

...Dangerous fire weather conditions for the southern to central
High Plains through mid=week...

A large storm system that was moving into the western U.S. Monday
afternoon will be responsible for a period of very active weather
across many areas of the lower 48 into the middle of the week.
Heavy snow will spread eastward across the Intermountain West
through tonight as an area of low pressure and trailing cold front
tracks toward the Great Plains. A strong low pressure system is
forecast to track from the central High Plains Tuesday morning
into the upper Mississippi River Valley Tuesday night as heavy
snow spreads out into the north-central U.S. A combination of
heavy snow and strong wind gusts will produce blizzard conditions
with significant blowing and drifting of snow from the eastern
slopes of the northern Rockies across the northern Plains. A long
duration snowfall event spanning 1-2 days is likely to generate
widespread 1-2 feet of accumulation from eastern Montana into
western and northern North Dakota with potential for 2-3 feet in
some locations before the storm ends.

Out ahead of the storm system, strong to severe thunderstorms will
be accompanied by isolated to scattered areas of flash flooding
spanning from portions of Arkansas into western Kentucky and
Tennessee tonight. A larger portion of the U.S. will be under a
threat for severe weather on Tuesday, with the Storm Prediction
Center forecasting an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms
extending from central Texas into eastern Nebraska and Iowa for
Tuesday. Flash flooding will be possible Tuesday evening into
Wednesday morning from the storms, with a focused threat extending
from the Sabine River Valley into the lower Mississippi Valley.

Behind a dryline, ongoing drought conditions combined with
widespread sustained winds of 30-40 mph and gusts over 50 mph will
set up an Extremely Critical risk for fire weather conditions from
West Texas into the central Plains. A significant fire weather
outbreak will be possible as a result, with favorable fire weather
conditions continuing into Wednesday for some of the same areas.

Temperatures are forecast to be well below average across the
western U.S. (15 to 30 degrees below average) through Wednesday
while warm southerly flow will transport well above average
temperatures into the central and eastern U.S. into mid-week. High
temperatures from the Great Plains to portions of the eastern U.S.
are likely to be 10-25 degrees above average.

...Overview...

Lower amplitude flow should dominate the lower 48, at least the
first half of the period, behind a departing deep upper low which
may linger across eastern Canada into next week. Guidance
generally shows a shortwave progressing into/through the West
during the weekend and into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early
next week. This feature may produce another round of precipitation
over the northern and eastern part of the country. Although there
is some agreement with the large scale pattern, there is still
plenty of uncertainty with respect to specific
system/precipitation details all the way from the West Coast into
the East. West coast may get a break for a day or two before the
next system approaches next Tuesday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The GFS continues to be a little bit on the faster side with the
deep upper low coming out of the Upper Midwest on Friday, as well
as a weak low that may track offshore New England. Despite this, a
general blend of the deterministic guidance gave a good starting
point. The next system enters the west by Saturday, with the
GFS/ECMWF a bit faster than the CMC/UKMET. By Sunday-Monday
however, uncertainties in the details of this system really ramp
up. The GFS has consistently the past few runs been a bit quicker
and much flatter/weaker, but also doesn't have great run to run
continuity. The ECMWF has presented the best run to run continuity
with this system but is also by far the strongest and quickest to
develop a rather deep/wound up system over the Midwest states by
next Tuesday. The CMC is weaker and flattest with the energy as it
comes through the Plains next weekend but it does eventually show
a deep closed low across the Midwest like the ECMWF. Confidence is
low on any one solution, but regardless it seems likely some sort
of low pressure system will move across the central/eastern states
late period. Yet another system looks to move into the West next
Tuesday, and at this point, models show decent agreement on timing
but of course differ in intensity and details. The WPC blend
trended towards the ensemble means late period to help mitigate
differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system will likely continue to bring
gusty winds into Friday across the northern tier, resulting in
blowing a drifting of snow and possible hazardous travel
conditions in regions that received heavy snowfall in prior days.
Some generally light precipitation should also linger across the
Great Lakes/Northeast as well associated with this system.
Moisture and instability interacting with a warm front lifting
through the Southeast next weekend should bring moderate to
locally heavy rainfall to parts of the Southeast/lower Mississippi
Valley. Out West, a couple systems may bring rain/mountain snow to
parts of the Pacific Northwest and California into the northern
Rockies late this week into the weekend. Some of the activity from
the West Coast into the Cascades could be moderate to heavy but
there is considerable uncertainty over specifics of each system,
so confidence is lower than average for determining
coverage/timing of the most significant precipitation. Moisture
should spread east beyond the Rockies by next Sunday-Monday as low
pressure/fronts reach the central/eastern U.S. At least some
precipitation across the northern tier may be in the form of snow
while rainfall coverage/intensity over the East will depend on
currently uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High
Plains could see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with
system passage.

Expect the core of below normal temperatures to persist across the
northern High Plains into early next week, with daytime highs
generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings (especially
for daytime highs) are possible late this week when some lingering
daily records for lows/cold highs are possible. Over the West,
temperatures should moderate in between systems as a period of
upper ridging moves through. Thursday-Saturday will feature chilly
readings over the northern half of the region (minus 10-15F
anomalies for highs) and closer to normal temperatures farther
south. An upper ridge building over the region by the start of
next week should bring northern locations toward normal and
southern areas moderately above normal. The East should stay near
normal this weekend, but the system potentially reaching the
Midwest/East early next week could draw some of the chilly
northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it, with
expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. Moderately above
normal temps should also shift from the southern Plains into the
Southwest/central Great Basin early next week.

...Major winter storm to bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions
to parts of the Northern Plains through Wednesday night...

...Threats for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding exist
across eastern portions of the Central/Southern Plains into the
Mississippi Valley through Wednesday...

...Dangerous fire weather conditions for the Southern/Central High
Plains through mid-week...

A large storm system that was moving into the western U.S. Monday
afternoon will be responsible for a period of very active weather
across many areas of the lower 48 into the middle of the week. A
strong low pressure system is forecast to track from the Central
High Plains this morning into the Upper Mississippi River Valley
tonight as heavy snow spreads out into the north-central U.S. A
combination of heavy snow and strong wind gusts will produce
blizzard conditions with significant blowing and drifting of snow
from the eastern slopes of the Northern Rockies across the
Northern Plains. A long duration snowfall event spanning 1-2 days
is likely to generate widespread 1-2 feet of accumulation from
eastern Montana into western and northern North Dakota with
potential for 2-3 feet in some locations before the storm ends.

Out ahead of the storm system, a large portion of the central U.S.
will be under a threat for severe weather outbreak today, with the
Storm Prediction Center forecasting Enhanced Risks of severe
thunderstorms for central Texas and eastern Nebraska into Iowa.
Flash flooding will be possible Tuesday evening into Wednesday
morning from the storms, with a focused threat extending from the
Sabine River Valley into the lower Mississippi Valley. The
enhanced threats for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding shift
slightly eastward on Wednesday into parts of the western
Tennessee/Ohio River Valleys.

Behind a dryline, ongoing drought conditions combined with
widespread sustained winds of 30-40 mph and gusts over 50 mph will
set up an Extremely Critical risk for fire weather conditions from
West Texas into the Central Plains today. A significant fire
weather outbreak will be possible as a result, with favorable fire
weather conditions continuing into Wednesday for some of the same
areas.

Temperatures are forecast to be well below average across the
western U.S. (15 to 30 degrees below average) through Wednesday
while warm southerly flow will transport well above average
temperatures into the central and eastern U.S. into mid-week. High
temperatures from the Great Plains to portions of the eastern U.S.
are likely to be 10-25 degrees above average.

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF WEST TEXAS AND
OKLAHOMA INTO KANSAS....
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
HIGH PLAINS....

...Synopsis...
A potent upper low observed by regional IR/WV imagery early this
morning is currently undergoing rapid deepening across the Central
Rockies. Forecast to rapidly eject eastward onto the Plains by early
afternoon, this trough and an accompanying 80-90 kt jet streak will
support further intensification of an already strong lee low and
surface wind field across the southern/central Plains. A dryline
trailing the low will bisect a broad warm sector as it mixes east
through the afternoon leaving very dry surface conditions in its
wake. A rare combination of exceptionally dry fuels and high-end
meteorological parameter space lends strong confidence in Extremely
Critical fire weather conditions and the possibility of a
significant wildfire event across the southern/central High Plains.

*An outbreak of dangerous wildfire conditions is likely across the
southern and central high Plains Today!*

...West Texas through western Oklahoma and into Kansas...
Latest NWP timing guidance has firmed up solutions on the ejection
of the primary upper trough and associated jet streak across the
Plains. The mid-level system, slightly slower than previous
guidance, should begin to move out over the southern and central
High Plains by mid morning. As strong ascent overspreads the High
Plains, the lee low should continue to deepen peaking below 990 mb
across western NE before quickly moving northeast into the upper
Midwest by tonight. With strong surface pressure falls and the
emergence of the mid and low-level jet, strong surface winds of
30-45 mph and 55+ mph gusts should quickly develop in the southwest
quadrant of the low coincident with the low-level thermal ridge.
Subsidence/mixing beneath the jet, downslope trajectories and
surface temperatures climbing into the 90s F should rapidly decrease
surface RH within the corridor of maximum winds through the
afternoon. By peak heating, surface RH in the mid single digits will
be possible within the broader area of RH less than 10% across the
southern/central High Plains. Peak fire weather conditions are
expected from roughly 18-23z across a southwest to northeast
corridor from western TX through the Panhandles and western OK into
western/central KS where hi-res guidance shows Fosberg index values
over 90.

Some uncertainty exists in the eastern extent of Critical and
Extremely Critical conditions based on model differences with
respect to the dryline. While a tight gradient will exist, strong
winds within the surface pressure trough in the vicinity of the
dryline will likely support Elevated and Critical fire weather
potential. Another concern will be the presence of a fast moving
cold front expected to travel southeast across the Critical area
near sunset. Strong winds along the front as well as a prominent
wind shift to the north/northwest may impact fire direction and
spread rates despite cooling temperatures and slow rising RH.

...Central High Plains...
To the west of the main risk corridor, strong downslope winds are
expected in the wake of the aforementioned cold front. While
uncertainty remains high with respect to surface RH conditions
behind the cooler airmass across western NE and SD, at least a few
hours of very strong northwesterly winds may align with relatively
dry surface conditions amid dry fuels. The Elevated area was
expanded westward to account for at least some fire weather
potential given the magnitude of low-level flow near the strong
surface low.

Across much of the southern/central Plains, fuels states are
exceptionally volatile. ERC values in the 90-95th percentile are
ubiquitous across the southern High Plains with lesser, but still
very dry conditions extending farther north into the central High
Plains. Severe drought, several antecedent days of Critical drying
and numerous reports of large fires over the preceding days shows
fuel beds are extremely receptive to fire starts and spreads. High
confidence exists in several hours of Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions developing beneath the low-level jet core and
thermal ridge axis from west TX, through the Panhandles, western OK,
and into western KS. The overlap of rare meteorological and fuel
parameter space matches well with several Great Plains wildfire
outbreak analogs giving further confidence in significant potential
for a widespread and high-end fire weather outbreak.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
As the powerful mid-level cyclone shifts northeastward through Day
1/Tuesday, mid-level flow will turn northwesterly and accelerate
over the Southwest and Southern High Plains. Despite cooling
temperatures, very strong wind fields and very low humidity are
expected to develop support a second day of widespread Critical fire
weather conditions within receptive fuels.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
With the mid-level jet turning more westerly with time behind the
departing upper low across the Midwest, strong west/northwesterly
flow will continue to overspread the southern Rockies and High
Plains. Strong downslope winds are expected from eastern NM into the
western TX Panhandle Wednesday afternoon and evening. With strong
subsidence and downsloping, extremely dry surface conditions appear
likely to develop with model soundings showing mean mixed-layer RH
values as low as 2-3%. Extremely dry fuels remain in place
supporting high confidence in dangerous fire weather conditions.

Lesser confidence exists in the potential for sustained Extremely
Critical conditions across portions of eastern NM and the
southwestern TX Panhandle. The primary concerns revolve around
duration of the stronger winds as a cooler boundary-layer and cold
front may limit any Extremely Critical Conditions. Offset from the
brunt of diurnal heating, overlap appears to be small casting
significant uncertainty. However, fuel states remain exceptionally
favorable for fire spreads/starts supporting at least the potential
for an upgrade to Extremely critical in subsequent outlooks.

...Central High Plains...
In the wake of the earlier cold front, dry and windy conditions
should develop for a few hours across the central High Plains and
lee of the Rockies. The potential for light precipitation from Day 1
is not expected to hamper extremely dry fuels in place across the
region. While surface temperatures should be cool in the
post-frontal airmass, low relative humidity and gusty winds should
support Elevated fire weather potential for a few hours before the
arrival of cooler temperatures and higher humidity overnight.

Temperatures are forecast to be well below average across the
western U.S. (15 to 30 degrees below average) through Wednesday
while warm southerly flow will transport well above average
temperatures into the central and eastern U.S. into mid-week. High
temperatures from the Great Plains to portions of the eastern U.S.
are likely to be 10-25 degrees above average.

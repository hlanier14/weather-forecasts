Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 AM EST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Dec 3 2021 - 12Z Tue Dec 7 2021

...Overview...

A quasi-zonal flow pattern is expected to be in place to close out
the work week across the northern tier states with a pronounced
trough exiting the East Coast.  By the weekend, an upper ridge
axis tries to become established over the West Coast and the
eastern Pacific, and a trough amplifies with developing surface
low over the Plains.  This will likely be followed by a second
well organized storm system by the end of the forecast period
across the western High Plains, with a zonal flow pattern across
the eastern half of the nation.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent agreement on Friday
before more noticeable differences emerge by Saturday, with the
GFS indicating a flatter trough over the Great Lakes and
Northeast, and the ensemble means are not capturing the magnitude
of the incoming trough across the Pacific Northwest that will
eventually lead to an organized low pressure system over the
Plains by Sunday morning.  The CMC has trended more in line with
the model consensus compared to previous days across the western
U.S., and is reasonably close to the GFS and ECMWF with portraying
the next trough/storm system arriving on the West Coast by Monday
night.  By the end of the forecast period, the GFS is considerably
stronger and slower with the trough approaching the East Coast.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend
through Saturday.  Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means whilst keeping some of the operational GFS and
ECMWF.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively uneventful in terms of rainfall or
snow related hazards with not much in the way of heavy
precipitation currently expected through early Sunday.  Rounds of
relatively light precipitation are forecast for the Midwest, Great
Lakes, and Northeast with a progressive storm track over the
region.  Moisture increasing ahead of a cold front is expected to
result in scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep
South to the Ohio Valley over the weekend, but amounts are not
currently expected to be excessive.  A shortwave and cold front
reaching the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night and through Monday
is expected to result in another round of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows to western Washington and Oregon,
with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies by
Tuesday with heavy snow possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for early December
across most of the nation through early next week, with the
greatest positive anomalies expected for the central and southern
Plains on Friday where highs are forecast to be 15 to 25 degrees
above average.  Another episode of well above normal temperatures
is likely for the western High Plains on Monday ahead of the next
cold front.  A few locations may approach daily record highs with
these mild temperatures.  On the other end of the spectrum, cold
weather is forecast to continue across the Northeast U.S. with
highs running up to 10 degrees below normal through the weekend
with a cold upper level trough overhead.  However, no major arctic
airmass intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level flow regime will largely remain in place through the
end of the Day 2/Wednesday period. The weak upper-level low
currently over Baja CA will persist off the southern CA coast, but
is forecast to weaken through the day. As a result, offshore
pressure gradient winds will persist from late Tuesday into
Wednesday morning, but will gradually diminish through the late
afternoon/evening. With dry fuels already in place, another day of
fire weather concerns is expected. Elsewhere, fire weather concerns
will be limited due to questionable overlap of strong winds and dry
conditions.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient is expected to linger into early
Wednesday morning, and may strengthen slightly between the 12-18 UTC
period per some model solutions. However, ensemble means suggest
strong downslope winds will likely remain confined to the higher
coastal terrain with gusts between 15 to 30 mph. Downslope effects
will maintain reduced RH values in the teens, which will continue to
support at least elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions - especially across Los Angeles and Ventura counties
where probabilities for sustained critical conditions are relatively
higher. The spatially limited nature of the threat precludes
Critical risk highlights, but ensemble guidance and observations
will continue to be monitored for trends towards windier solutions.

precipitation over the Pacific Northwest and Great Lakes/Northeast

the Great Lakes region on Wednesday night. Some rain showers may
reach as far south as the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians as
the surface front sags into the area on Wednesday morning. An
approaching system will bring light to moderate rain showers to
the Pacific Northwest today. No mountain snow is expected from
this event as temperatures will remain too warm well into the
higher elevations.

Upper-level ridging over the West will contribute to above average
temperatures in the region today. Some high temperature records
may be broken in southern California as a result. Elevated Fire
Weather risk is in effect for SoCal through Wednesday as a cut-off
low low over Baja continues to increase winds and dry conditions.

...Light rain and snow showers over portions of the Great Lakes

High pressure dominance in the West will contribute to a record
breaking start to our December with respect to temperatures.
Negligible precipitation over the Pacific Northwest and Great
Lakes/Northeast will continue over the next few days. A pair of
low pressure systems traversing southern Canada will produce light
to isolated moderate snow downwind of the Great Lakes and interior
Northeast over the next couple of days. General totals are
forecast to remain below a couple inches, but areas downwind of
Lake Ontario may see upwards of 3-6 inches through Thursday
morning. Some rain may get mixed in as the warm front associated
with the second, more organized system moves into the Great Lakes
on Wednesday night. Some rain shower activity may develop as far
south as the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians as the
quasi-stationary front sags into the area on Wednesday morning. An
approaching system will bring light to moderate rain showers to
the Pacific Northwest today. No mountain snow is expected from
this event as temperatures will remain too warm for such
precipitation well into the higher elevations.

Upper-level ridging across the West will contribute to above
average temperatures in the region today. Some high temperature
records may be broken in southern California as a result. Elevated
Fire Weather risk is in effect for this region through Wednesday
as a cut-off low over Baja continues to increase northeasterly
winds and dry conditions in the area. A strengthening and
expansion of the upper-ridge into the Rockies on Wednesday will
contribute to the emergence of anomalous warmth for much of the
West. Low temperatures tonight will be warm enough to potentially
break records throughout the Northwest, where some areas may see
lows as warm as 25-30 degrees above average. Highs on Wednesday
will be between 25-30 degrees above average for much of the
Northern/Central Plains. Widespread high temperature records may
be broken over portions of the Northwest, Northern/Central Plains
and across California that day, while warm air creeps into the
Eastern third of the country as well. The expansion of the ridge
into the Great Plains on Wednesday night into Thursday will see
night time low records potentially broken across the Northern
Rockies, down through the Front Range and into the
Northern/Central Rockies. We'll see our greatest chance for
widespread high temperature records being set this Thursday across
the Central/Southern Plains where high temperatures could reach as
high as 40 degrees above average. Fortunately, this only means
that temperatures will peak in the 60s and 70s, so nothing too
uncomfortable is expected.

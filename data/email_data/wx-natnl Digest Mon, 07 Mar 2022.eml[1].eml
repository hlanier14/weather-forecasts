Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Sun Mar 06 2022

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...THE
WESTERN PERMIAN BASIN...THE TRANS PECOS...AND VICINITY....

Trimmed the northeastern extent of the critical/elevated areas based
on the morning frontal position and expected northeast mixing
through the day. Elsewhere, no additional changes were necessary.

..Bentley.. 03/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CST Sun Mar 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
Another potent mid-level jet will swing through the Southwest and
into the southern High Plains during the afternoon today. A modest
surface low will develop in West Texas and move southeastward
roughly along the Rio Grande. To the north, a cold front will remain
quasi-stationary through late afternoon. Thereafter, it will
progress through western and central portions of Texas.

Critical fire weather is expected from the Trans-Pecos into
southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of the South Plains
and Permian Basin. Strong winds are again expected as the mid-level
jet couples with strong 850 mb flow. Surface speeds of 20-25 mph
will be common. Localized 30+ mph winds are certainly possible, but
the modest surface low suggests it will remain spatially
constrained. RH across eastern New Mexico in to western Texas will
fall to 10-15%. Locally extremely critical conditions may occur on a
localized basis as it does not appear the strongest winds will
overlap single digit RH for very long. The primary area for this
will likely be east-central New Mexico into the South Plains where
better low/mid-level wind alignment will occur. RH near 5% also
appears probable within the Big Bend region as downslope drying
occurs off of the Mexican Plateau. Winds are expected to reach 20
mph, but will likely fall short of 30 mph given the stronger
mid-level winds being displaced to the north.

couple of potent shortwaves, the first diving into the Northwest
Wednesday and another reaching the north-central U.S. Thursday
into Friday. These features should press the trough axis eastward
late week into the weekend, along with an Arctic cold front that
will spread chilly temperatures across the interior West and
central U.S. and into the East by the weekend. Expect snow to the
northwest of the low from the central Rockies/Plains to the
Midwest on Wednesday and Thursday, with less certain potential for
wintry weather over the Ohio Valley and interior Northeast Friday
and Saturday. Meanwhile showers and thunderstorms are likely in
the Southeast through late week before the cold front clears out
the moisture by next Sunday. Flow should become somewhat more
zonal across the CONUS early next week as the trough lifts out of
the East, with weak systems through the northern tier states.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance continues to show fairly good agreement for the
overall pattern especially initially in the medium range period
given the large scale of the features--strong East Pacific
ridging, troughing across the lower 48, and a subtropical high
over the Caribbean to ridging in the Atlantic. However, there are
some differences in the shortwave details that become impactful by
the latter part of the week especially with the timing of the
trough's movement and thus the cold frontal timing. Broadly, the
GFS model suite is faster with the trough axis and front pressing
eastward compared to the ECMWF suite and the CMC. This is shown by
most individual ensemble members as well as the operational runs
and ensemble means from the 00/06Z cycle, and remained the case in
the 12Z guidance that has come in thus far. Given typical model
performance, the WPC forecast attempted to take an approach in
between but somewhat favoring the ECMWF suite, which slowed the
front and trough axis down from continuity a bit. The 06Z GFS was
somewhat slower and thus better clustered with other guidance
compared to the 00Z run, so preferred the 06Z run. Differences in
the trough/front also lead to variability with the strength and
progression of Great Lakes low pressure Friday and its eventual
track northeastward--overall slower to strengthen and move. As
noted in the previous discussion, CMC runs including yesterday's
12Z and today's 00Z end up closing or almost closing off an upper
low in the Midwest by Saturday, which is an outlier compared to
other guidance that keeps the trough phased with a northern Canada
upper low. Thus the CMC was not preferred, but its new 12Z run
seems comparatively more in line with consensus. Then there is
fairly good model consensus for the ridging initially over the
East Pacific to track inland late week, but then get suppressed by
shortwave energy approaching or entering the Pacific Northwest by
next Sunday, but there are still uncertainties with the timing of
shortwaves and surface features there.

In summary the WPC forecast began with a multi-model deterministic
blend, and gradually transitioned to a blend favoring the ECMWF in
terms of deterministic guidance with some 06Z GFS input, and
adding and increasing the proportion of the ensemble means,
particularly the ECENS mean, to reduce individual model
differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A stationary boundary settling across the Southeast and ample
moisture and instability from the Gulf of Mexico should keep
showers and storms in the forecast Wednesday to early Saturday.
Localized heavy rainfall rates are likely in this environment, and
flooding/flash flooding may be a threat with heavy downpours,
especially where multiple rounds of convection track over the same
areas during the period, despite the antecedent dry conditions.
Meanwhile, a shortwave moving through the West on Wednesday will
continue a threat for heavy mountain snows for parts of the
interior West and central Rockies. A low pressure system spinning
up in the lee of the Rockies and lifting into the Upper Midwest
Thursday-Friday brings a winter storm threat from the central
Plains to the Upper Midwest. The elongated upper trough should tap
Gulf of Mexico moisture with widespread rain into the East ahead
of the cold front on Friday, with some potential for wintry
weather on the northern/western side of the precipitation shield,
but with low confidence for amounts and placement at this point.
The next system coming into the Northwest next weekend is likely
to increase rain and mountain snow chances across the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.

Arctic sourced air will spill into the Plains, with daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas through Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains and in higher elevations
of the Rockies are likely to be near or below zero for many
locations. Ahead of the cold front, above normal temperatures
should spread across the eastern third of the country Thursday and
Friday before being replaced by below normal temperatures by
Saturday following the passage of the cold front. By next Sunday,
most of the country should modify closer to normal as upper flow
become less amplified, though with lingering cool temperatures in
the East and along the Gulf Coast.

...Severe thunderstorms and instances of flash flooding possible
from the ArkLaTex region to the Ohio Valley between tonight and
Monday afternoon...

...Swath of light to moderate snowfall forecast over parts of the
Midwest and Great Lakes into Monday morning...

...Record-breaking warmth expected to continue throughout parts of
the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on Monday...

...Cold front entering the Northwest and Northern Rockies Monday
night to bring locally heavy snowfall across the higher terrain...


A lifting shortwave trough over the Central Plains this evening
and an associated area of low pressure over the Middle Mississippi
Valley will lead to chances for severe weather, flash flooding,
and snowfall on the cold side of the system. For tonight, an
attached cold front extending to the east and into the northern
Mid-Atlantic is expected to be the focus for numerous showers and
thunderstorms from southern Missouri through much of the Ohio
Valley as it stalls and slowly lifts northward. Heavy rain
associated with the slow-moving thunderstorms could produce
rainfall totals up to 3 inches. This amount of rain in a
relatively short period of time could trigger scattered flash
floods. In order to highlight the potential flash flooding threat,
WPC has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall for
this region. The excessive rainfall threat continues over the Ohio
Valley into Monday as a potent cold front eventually sweeps toward
the Appalachians and Gulf Coast, with additional rounds of
thunderstorms possible. Flood Watches are also currently in effect
from western to central Kentucky. The threat of damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes also exists as
thunderstorms develop and progress across the Lower Mississippi
and Ohio Valleys tonight. Specifically, there remains a greater
risk of severe weather over northern Arkansas and southern
Missouri this evening. SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5)
of severe thunderstorms here, with damaging winds gusts and a few
tornadoes possible. On Monday, severe thunderstorms may accompany
the advancing cold front from West Virginia to central Alabama,
where SPC has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms.

Farther north, colder air has filtered into the Central Plains,
Midwest, and Great Lakes, which will support accumulating snowfall
between northeast Kansas tonight and central Michigan by Monday.
Although the system will be fast-moving, a burst of moderate to
locally heavy snow could create low visibility and dangerous
driving conditions for the Monday morning commute. Overall,
snowfall amounts are expected to remain below 6 inches, with the
heaviest amounts found from southern Wisconsin to central
Michigan. By late Monday, the low pressure system and wintry
precipitation will shift into far northern New England. Cold and
blustery winds behind the cold front could lead to scattered lake
effect snow showers on Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, much of the eastern U.S. enjoyed a warm Sunday ahead of
the approaching weather system. This early taste of Spring will
continue into Monday throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.
Widespread highs into the 70s and 80s will extend from the central
Gulf Coast to New Jersey. These temperatures equate to around 20
to 30 degrees above average in the Mid-Atlantic, with dozens of
daily records likely to fall across this section of the Nation as
well. Temperatures will crash back to near normal levels behind a
cold front on Tuesday.

Elsewhere, the next cold front to enter the Lower 48 will swing
into the Northern Rockies and Northwest by Monday night. Along
with a drop in temperatures, moderate to locally heavy snow is
possible for much of the higher terrain of Idaho, Montana, and
northwest Wyoming into Tuesday. Snowfall totals greater than 6
inches are anticipated, with lighter amounts located over the
Cascades.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes have been made. In addition to the factors mentioned in
the previous discussion (see below), 12Z high resolution guidance
keeps relative humidity above 40 percent across Georgia and South
Carolina.

Some brief offshore flow is possible across southern California
Monday morning/afternoon. However, fuels are not that favorable in
the higher terrain where the stronger winds will be, and
temperatures will be somewhat cool.

..Bentley.. 03/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CST Sun Mar 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
A band of strong mid-level winds will stretch from the southern High
Plains into the Northeast on Sunday. At the surface, a cold front
will be through the southern Plains and continue to make
southeastward progress across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Cooler
conditions and precipitation are expected to keep fire weather
concerns low across most areas.

...Eastern Georgia into central South Carolina...
Ahead of the approaching cold front, breezy southwesterly winds are
likely. With temperatures warming into the upper 80s F, some areas
may observe RH near 30%. 10-hour fuel information from the Georgia
Forestry Commission suggests that fire weather concerns will likely
be localized as moisture levels are generally 15-20%. These
conditions will be monitored, however, as elevated meteorological
conditions are possible if not probable.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun March 06 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 AM CST Mon Mar 07 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move eastward from the upper Midwest
into the Northeast today. Farther west, another trough will dig
southward into the Four Corners. Cold air and high pressure will be
in place from the Great Basin into the Plains. Fire weather concerns
will generally remain low for most areas.

Some locally elevated conditions may develop in parts of eastern
Georgia into central South Carolina ahead of the approaching cold
front. Fine fuel moisture has been reduced some during Sunday's warm
and dry conditions. However, RH may only fall below 35% on a very
spatially limited basis.

In California, warm and dry downslope winds are possible within the
Sacramento Valley and the higher terrain of southern California. Due
to recent precipitation, fuels are not receptive enough to fire
spread for highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1248 AM CST Mon Mar 07 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will develop across most of the lower 48
on Tuesday. With high pressure and cooler temperatures, fire weather
concerns will be low for most areas. Portions of the Southwest will
remain quite dry. Some modest westerly flow aloft could promote a
weak lee trough in the southern High Plains. Even so, winds are
still expected to be light. Any elevated conditions would be highly
localized.

...Winter storm threat for parts of the Midwest on
Thursday-Friday, with heavy to excessive rainfall likely across
the Southeast...

...Overview...

A shortwave digging south through the interior West as the medium
range period starts Thursday will amplify troughing across the
central U.S. and shift east with time, exiting the East Coast by
Sunday. This will push a strong arctic boundary south across the
Plains and then the East as an area of low pressure develops and
deepens through the Midwest and Northeast Friday and Saturday. A
swath of snow is expected to the northwest of the surface low,
potentially heavy rainfall across parts of the East ahead of the
front, and a chilly arctic airmass engulfing much of the central
and eastern U.S. to follow. By early next week, flow across the
CONUS should become a little more zonal as weak systems move
through the northern tier states, though the next trough may
develop across the central U.S. by next Monday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

In general, the model guidance continues to show reasonable
agreement for the large scale pattern across the CONUS, but with
plenty of uncertainty in timing and details of features. The most
impactful differences surround the amplified trough into the
Plains and East Friday-Saturday. The 18z/Mar 6 (and todays new
00z) run of the GFS continues to be quite a bit faster with trough
axis and frontal placement, although an ever so slight slower
trend is noted with the last few runs. Meanwhile, the 12z/Mar 6
ECMWF (with support from its ensemble members) was the slowest of
the solutions, however the 00z run today did come in a little
faster. Both the CMC and UKMET were more in the middle of these
two camps, and probably the best proxy for the overnight medium
range progs which are a hair slower than previous WPC continuity.
The next shortwave hits the Pacific Northwest by Sunday, and
there's pretty good agreement on this, but the CMC is a little
slower. Beyond day 5, preferred a solution closer to the ensemble
means to help mitigate these later period differences which will
take time to resolve anyways.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms should be ongoing by Thursday across the
Southeast as a frontal boundary settles over the region with ample
moisture and instability present. This boundary should finally
become absorbed/push east with the strong cold front on Saturday,
but not before several days of widespread rain. At least locally
heavy rainfall is a concern, and flooding/flash flooding may be a
threat with heavy downpours, especially where multiple rounds of
convection track over the same areas during the period, despite
the relatively dry antecedent conditions. Meanwhile, low pressure
spinning up in the lee of the Rockies and lifting into the Upper
Midwest Thursday-Friday brings a winter storm threat from the
central Plains to the Upper Midwest, with less certain wintry
impacts into the Ohio Valley and interior Northeast Friday and
Saturday. The elongated upper trough should tap Gulf of Mexico
moisture with widespread rain into much of the East ahead of the
cold front on Friday. The next system coming into the Northwest
next weekend is likely to increase rain and mountain snow chances
across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies as well.

Arctic sourced air will spill into the Plains on the backside of
the front, with daytime highs 20-30+ degrees below normal as far
south as Texas through Friday. Overnight lows across the northern
Plains and in higher elevations of the Rockies are likely to be
near or below zero for many locations. Ahead of the cold front,
above normal temperatures should spread across the eastern third
of the country Thursday and Friday before being replaced by below
normal temperatures next weekend following the passage of the cold
front. Meanwhile, parts of the West and central U.S. next
Sunday-Monday may be moderately above normal as upper ridging
slides overhead.

...Severe thunderstorms and instances of flash flooding possible
for much of the eastern third of the country today...

...Record-breaking warmth expected to continue throughout East
Coast today...

...Cold front entering the Northwest will generate heavy snowfall
over the Northern Rockies through Tuesday...

A cold front will be the focus for heavy rainfall and
thunderstorms across parts of the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic today.
A Slight Risk of heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding is in
effect for portions of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys today. Flood
Watches, Warnings and Advisories are in effect for these areas as
well. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is also in effect for
much of the Central/Southern Appalachians, Ohio/Tennessee Valleys,
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, due to the interaction of the very
warm/moist airmass currently in place in the East and the
approaching cold front from the West. Damaging wind gusts will be
the main concern with any severe weather that occurs. This warm
airmass will be responsible for the possible tying or breaking of
temperature records across the East Coast, from New York City to
central Florida, today. High temperatures are expected to be
between 20-30 degrees above average for much of the Mid-Atlantic,
with some isolated areas possibly eclipsing 30 degree anomalies.
Meanwhile, to the west, high pressure will settle in and allow for
the expansion of colder air over the Rockies, Plains and
Mississippi Valley today. The southern portion of the East Coast
cold front will stall out tonight, which will allow for the
development of a new surface low pressure system. This new system
will tap more moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and dump it in the
form of heavy rain and scattered thunderstorms over the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast beginning on Tuesday.

The emergence of a shortwave from western Canada will push a cold
front down through the Northwest tonight. Surface waves will
develop along this boundary and trigger periods of heavy snow over
the Northern/Central Rockies through Tuesday. Winter Weather
Advisories are in effect for parts of central Montana. Frigid air
will begin expanding over the Northern Plains/Rockies on the
backside of the south-moving cold front on Tuesday. This cold
airmass will continue its southward expansion through midweek.
Southern/central Texas will have high temperatures well below
average on Tuesday thanks to the extension of a northern ridge
axis over the region.

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME EASTERN MONTANA INTO
WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA AND FAR NORTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

Very minor adjustments were made to the current Day 1 fire weather
highlights to account for clouds and precipitation across
central/eastern Montana. Otherwise, clear skies will promote
continued mixing of the boundary layer across the northern High
Plains, coincident with strengthening surface lee troughing/gradient
flow. As such, 20+ mph sustained south-southeasterly surface flow
and 15-25% RH are expected during the afternoon, warranting the
continuation of Elevated/Critical highlights across the northern
High Plains.

Locally Elevated conditions are also expected along the Colorado
Front Range. However, the brief nature of these conditions precludes
the addition of Elevated highlights. Similarly, Elevated highlights
were withheld across central into eastern Montana. Enough
boundary-layer mixing should support widespread 25% RH and winds
exceeding 15 mph at times, atop fuels that are highly receptive to
wildfire spread. Still, the combination of clouds/precipitation and
lack of a more widespread and long-lasting 15+ mph surface wind
field suggests that Elevated highlights are not warranted.

..Squitieri.. 10/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1215 AM CDT Wed Oct 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
Lee cyclogenesis has already begun in southern Canada. Expect
further strengthening of the surface low through the day today as
heights fall across the Canadian Rockies. As this surface low
deepens, the surface pressure gradient will tighten and lead to
strengthening surface flow. Winds are forecast to be 20 to 25 mph.
In addition, warm and dry conditions are forecast in the region with
temperatures warming into the 80s. This will lead to relative
humidity in the teens. ERC values in the region are near record
high. These dry fuels and dry and breezy conditions will lead to
critical fire weather conditions in portions of the northern Plains.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 06 2021

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure is forecast to shift from
initially over the West to the Pacific during the first half of the period.
This evolution supports concerns for much below-normal temperatures for poi=
nts
west of the Rockies early in the period, with growing heavy precipitation
potential for the West coast later in Week-2. A surface cyclone shifting fr=
om
the Northern Plains to the Canadian Prairies near the start of the period
could
bring some lingering high wind potential for the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley in its wake. Mid-level high pressure centered over easte=
rn
North America is likely to keep conditions quiet from a hazardous weather
perspective for points east of the Rockies. Mid-level low pressure forecast
over Alaska during Week-2 supports below-normal temperatures for most of th=
e
state and enhanced onshore flow into southeastern Alaska, although no
associated hazards appear likely at present.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest, Thu-Fri, Oct 14-15.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of the western U.S.,
Thu-Sat, Oct 14-16.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, Thu, Oct 14.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 09 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 13:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!oVOcgli101dGQ9EY6UnRJYVF4tLZ-tiLJidBIWCFU9oy9Jfdm7Q2Ok9Zby5zU=
elbbRE2T6bQ$

FOR THURSDAY OCTOBER 14 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 20: Model guidance continues to
portray some degree of anomalous mid-level troughing over the North Pacific
and
western U.S. at the outset of Week-2. Today's 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean tends
toward two discrete features over the Gulf of Alaska and western U.S., wher=
eas
the 0Z GEFS ensemble mean has more of an elongated trough axis extending fr=
om
the Alaska Peninsula through the West. The ECMWF sees its easternmost cente=
r
forecast to dissipate by Day 10 (10/16), whereas the GEFS pattern phases to
yield a relatively more amplified anomalous trough over the northeastern
Pacific compared to the ECMWF model by this date. Through the remainder of =
the
period the anomalous trough in the GEFS is positioned closer to the Pacific
Coast, although its amplitude begins to decay by late in Week-2 compared to
the
ECMWF's anomalous trough which shows some signs of amplification further we=
st
over the northeastern Pacific.



The bottom line is that the fate of any troughing over the northeastern
Pacific
and West is likely to drive possible hazardous weather during mid- to
late-October. With the troughing initially across the West, a moderate risk
for
much below-normal temperatures is maintained on the 14th and 15th for much =
of
the Great Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest. The only change spatially
relative to yesterday's outlook was carving out some of the Northern Great
Basin based on the two discrete centers from the ECMWF outlook which manife=
sts
as weaker cold signals in its reforecast guidance. Within the moderate risk
for
much below-normal temperatures daily minimum temperature anomalies of -10
degrees F or more appear likely, with actual observed values highly depende=
nt
upon latitude and elevation. The slight risk for much below-normal
temperatures
is consistent with the previous two days' coverage, although its duration i=
s
now limited to 10/14-10/16 with models agreeing on the anomalous troughing
becoming focused over the North Pacific by the middle of the period. The
slight
risk for much below-normal temperatures area is drawn to correspond to area=
s
with the best chance of seeing temperatures fall below 40 degrees F
(approximately as a threshold for frost potential).



Today's WPC surface analysis anticipates a surface low centered over
southwestern South Dakota on Day 7 (10/13). This feature continues to be
forecast to lift into Central Canada , with any associated precipitation
hazards likely north of the border by Week-2. The exception to this is for
high
wind potential, which remains possible on the backside of the deepening
surface
low. A slight risk for high winds (sustained values >35 mph or gusts >45 mp=
h)
is posted for parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on =
the
14th to account for this possibility.



The shift toward troughing over the northeastern Pacific bears monitoring f=
or
atmospheric river potential. With the ECMWF model maintaining the anomalous
trough further off the Pacific Coast late in Week-2, its moisture stream is
shifted away from the coastline and further north into British Columbia. Th=
e
GEFS trough being forecast closer to the Pacific Northwest results in some
degree of atmospheric river potential stretching from Northern California
through the Canadian border during the second half of Week-2. Given the
disagreement on the placement of troughing, no heavy precipitation or high
wind
hazards are introduced across the West at this time, but are likely to need=
 to
be revisited in subsequent outlooks.



The approach of the enhanced Phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) t=
o
the Western Hemisphere continues to be forecast among the various ensemble
suites. The ECMWF model has actually sped up this progression compared to p=
ast
runs, with its RMM forecast reaching Phase 8 by late in Week-2. With the
enhanced MJO envelope's return, tropical cyclogenesis chances are likely to
see
an increase over the Atlantic during the last third of October. Climatology
favors tropical cyclogenesis over the Caribbean Sea during late October and
November, with systems typically either tracking toward Central America or
entering the Gulf of Mexico. For more on long-range tropical cyclone
development potential, please reference subsequent Global Tropical Hazards
Outlooks (next update Friday, 10/8) and Week-2 U.S. Hazard Outlooks.



The Week-2 mean circulation has Alaska generally beneath anomalous 500-hPa
troughing, suggestive of a relatively cool pattern for the state. ECMWF
reforecast guidance is more robust on the potential for this cold to be
hazardous, while the GEFS is far more benign. No temperature hazards are
indicated given this discrepancy between the models. The persistence of the
troughing is likely to bring onshore flow into southeastern Alaska, althoug=
h
no
period within Week-2 currently appears prone to reaching precipitation haza=
rd
thresholds for Alaska.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 06 2021

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure is forecast to shift from
initially over the West to the Pacific during the first half of the period.
This evolution supports concerns for much below-normal temperatures for poi=
nts
west of the Rockies early in the period, with growing heavy precipitation
potential for the West coast later in Week-2. A surface cyclone shifting fr=
om
the Northern Plains to the Canadian Prairies near the start of the period
could
bring some lingering high wind potential for the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley in its wake. Mid-level high pressure centered over easte=
rn
North America is likely to keep conditions quiet from a hazardous weather
perspective for points east of the Rockies. Mid-level low pressure forecast
over Alaska during Week-2 supports below-normal temperatures for most of th=
e
state and enhanced onshore flow into southeastern Alaska, although no
associated hazards appear likely at present.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest, Thu-Fri, Oct 14-15.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of the western U.S.,
Thu-Sat, Oct 14-16.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, Thu, Oct 14.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY OCTOBER 09 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 13:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!tmOsoyJM7-W7_rqKvDLzmaR-mvmsawL8LXIMP39_GA_j3tLWphmflgMqkym8s=
e6qEOnWuRBB$

FOR THURSDAY OCTOBER 14 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 20: Model guidance continues to
portray some degree of anomalous mid-level troughing over the North Pacific
and
western U.S. at the outset of Week-2. Today's 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean tends
toward two discrete features over the Gulf of Alaska and western U.S., wher=
eas
the 0Z GEFS ensemble mean has more of an elongated trough axis extending fr=
om
the Alaska Peninsula through the West. The ECMWF sees its easternmost cente=
r
forecast to dissipate by Day 10 (10/16), whereas the GEFS pattern phases to
yield a relatively more amplified anomalous trough over the northeastern
Pacific compared to the ECMWF model by this date. Through the remainder of =
the
period the anomalous trough in the GEFS is positioned closer to the Pacific
Coast, although its amplitude begins to decay by late in Week-2 compared to
the
ECMWF's anomalous trough which shows some signs of amplification further we=
st
over the northeastern Pacific.



The bottom line is that the fate of any troughing over the northeastern
Pacific
and West is likely to drive possible hazardous weather during mid- to
late-October. With the troughing initially across the West, a moderate risk
for
much below-normal temperatures is maintained on the 14th and 15th for much =
of
the Great Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest. The only change spatially
relative to yesterday's outlook was carving out some of the Northern Great
Basin based on the two discrete centers from the ECMWF outlook which manife=
sts
as weaker cold signals in its reforecast guidance. Within the moderate risk
for
much below-normal temperatures daily minimum temperature anomalies of -10
degrees F or more appear likely, with actual observed values highly depende=
nt
upon latitude and elevation. The slight risk for much below-normal
temperatures
is consistent with the previous two days' coverage, although its duration i=
s
now limited to 10/14-10/16 with models agreeing on the anomalous troughing
becoming focused over the North Pacific by the middle of the period. The
slight
risk for much below-normal temperatures area is drawn to correspond to area=
s
with the best chance of seeing temperatures fall below 40 degrees F
(approximately as a threshold for frost potential).



Today's WPC surface analysis anticipates a surface low centered over
southwestern South Dakota on Day 7 (10/13). This feature continues to be
forecast to lift into Central Canada , with any associated precipitation
hazards likely north of the border by Week-2. The exception to this is for
high
wind potential, which remains possible on the backside of the deepening
surface
low. A slight risk for high winds (sustained values >35 mph or gusts >45 mp=
h)
is posted for parts of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley on =
the
14th to account for this possibility.



The shift toward troughing over the northeastern Pacific bears monitoring f=
or
atmospheric river potential. With the ECMWF model maintaining the anomalous
trough further off the Pacific Coast late in Week-2, its moisture stream is
shifted away from the coastline and further north into British Columbia. Th=
e
GEFS trough being forecast closer to the Pacific Northwest results in some
degree of atmospheric river potential stretching from Northern California
through the Canadian border during the second half of Week-2. Given the
disagreement on the placement of troughing, no heavy precipitation or high
wind
hazards are introduced across the West at this time, but are likely to need=
 to
be revisited in subsequent outlooks.



The approach of the enhanced Phase of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) t=
o
the Western Hemisphere continues to be forecast among the various ensemble
suites. The ECMWF model has actually sped up this progression compared to p=
ast
runs, with its RMM forecast reaching Phase 8 by late in Week-2. With the
enhanced MJO envelope's return, tropical cyclogenesis chances are likely to
see
an increase over the Atlantic during the last third of October. Climatology
favors tropical cyclogenesis over the Caribbean Sea during late October and
November, with systems typically either tracking toward Central America or
entering the Gulf of Mexico. For more on long-range tropical cyclone
development potential, please reference subsequent Global Tropical Hazards
Outlooks (next update Friday, 10/8) and Week-2 U.S. Hazard Outlooks.



The Week-2 mean circulation has Alaska generally beneath anomalous 500-hPa
troughing, suggestive of a relatively cool pattern for the state. ECMWF
reforecast guidance is more robust on the potential for this cold to be
hazardous, while the GEFS is far more benign. No temperature hazards are
indicated given this discrepancy between the models. The persistence of the
troughing is likely to bring onshore flow into southeastern Alaska, althoug=
h
no
period within Week-2 currently appears prone to reaching precipitation haza=
rd
thresholds for Alaska.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

For a medium range forecast, there's actually really good
agreement through the entire period on the overall large scale
setup which features a shortwave/closed low lifting through the
southern Plains early next week, while troughing amplifies over
the West and a well defined low pressure system emerges into the
Central Plains by the middle of next week. There remains some
relatively minor timing and detail differences, but these kinds of
uncertainties may take until the short range to resolve. The WPC
forecast used a general blend of the operational models (06z GFS,
00z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) through day 5. For days 6 and 7, increased
contributions from the ensemble menas to help mitigate those
smaller scale uncertainties. This maintains good continuity with
the previous WPC forecast helping to increase confidence some in
the pattern and relevant weather hazards.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

While a lingering rainfall axis will continue into the weekend
from the Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians to the Great Lakes, the
focus this weekend should shift to the coast/offshore where a
frontal boundary and area of low pressure, with limited tropical
development probabilities, could bring some heavy downpours to
portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks and southeast Virginia.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their day extended outlook. The system should then begin
lifting and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with
mainly light to moderate precipitation.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 25-30 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies beginning on Sunday. A
low pressure system should eject out of the Rockies into the
Plains, with increasing confidence in potentially heavy snowfall
within an emerging deformation area on the back/west side of the
low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible to the north of the low, with some mixing of
snow not out of the question during the colder overnight hours.
Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and northern
Plains by Wednesday of next week as the surface low deepens
through the central U.S.. Across the central and southern Plains,
moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with another threat
for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as highlighted in the
latest SPC extended outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0147 PM CDT Wed Oct 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Latest guidance consensus suggests Elevated meteorological
conditions will be likely across portions of the southern High
Plains tomorrow. However, fuels remain poorly receptive to wildfire
spread, precluding any fire weather highlights. Elsewhere from the
Lower Colorado River Valley to the northern High Plains, brief and
patchy Elevated conditions may support very localized, low-end
wildfire spread potential.

..Squitieri.. 10/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1216 AM CDT Wed Oct 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cool conditions are expected across much of the western CONUS on
Thursday which should keep relative humidity above 25 percent in
most of the region. The exception will be far southern Arizona and
much of New Mexico where relative humidity will be in the 15 to 25
mph range. However, winds will be mostly light across this region.
Stronger winds are expected across portions of the Plains, but the
strongest winds are forecast where dewpoints are higher. Therefore,
no areas of fire weather concern are expected on Thursday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed October 06 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 12 - 16 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough is forecast over Alaska, while an amplified ridge=
 is
predicted south of the Aleutians. A deep trough with below normal 500-hPa
heights and mean cyclonic flow are expected across most of the western half=
 of
the CONUS. Strong ridging with above normal heights are forecast farther to
the
east across much of northeastern North America. The manual 500-hPa height
blend, based primarily on the ensemble means from the GEFS and ECMWF, depic=
ts
near to above normal heights across most of the Aleutians. Conversely, belo=
w
normal heights are favored for much of the remainder of Alaska.

With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal
temperatures are favored over western CONUS underneath predicted troughing =
and
below normal 500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over par=
ts
of the eastern Aleutians, Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle undernea=
th
predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Near to above normal
temperature probabilities are elevated over the western Aleutians, under ne=
ar
to above normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights increase th=
e
odds of above normal precipitation over most of the northwestern and centra=
l
CONUS. Conversely, below normal precipitation is favored for parts of New
Mexico, southeastern Arizona and southwestern Texas. Near to below normal
precipitation is likely for most of the eastern quarter of the CONUS,
underneath forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Troughing and
associated surface low pressure increase the odds of near to above normal
precipitation over southern Alaska, while below normal precipitation is
favored
in parts of northwestern Alaska, consistent with the operational autoblend
forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 14 - 20 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to become less amplifie=
d
over the CONUS. A predicted trough and below normal 500-hPa heights are
forecast near the West Coast of the CONUS, while ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over the northeastern CONUS.  A predicted tro=
ugh
and below normal heights are more likely over the eastern Aleutians, Mainla=
nd
Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar to the 6-=
10
day outlook period. With mean troughing expected near the West Coast, below
normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS. Above normal
temperatures are likely for most areas of the central and eastern CONUS,
underneath the forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Near to
below
normal temperatures are slightly favored for Alaska, associated with mean
troughing forecast over the state.

Predicted troughing and possible enhanced Pacific flow increase the odds of
near to above normal precipitation over the West Coast of the CONUS. Below
normal precipitation probabilities are elevated over parts of the west-cent=
ral
CONUS as well as parts of the coastal Southeast. Above normal precipitation=
 is
likely over parts of the Southern Plains, the Middle and Lower Mississippi
valley, and the Ohio and Tennessee Valley, supported by the consolidation
forecast tool. Troughing and associated surface low pressure increase the o=
dds
of near to above normal precipitation over Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fa=
ir
model agreement.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Additional areas of heavy rain and flash flooding likely across
parts of the Southeast and Southern Appalachians through Friday
morning...

...Well above average temperatures and Critical Fire Weather found
across the Northern Plains this evening...

...Showers, thunderstorms, and high elevation snow expected
throughout the Intermountain West and Northern/Central Rockies
over the next couple of days...

A large and rather slow-moving upper level low continues to churn
over the Lower Mississippi Valley this afternoon, producing
numerous showers and thunderstorms from the Midwest to the
Southeast as it inches northward. Ahead of this system, warm and
moist air is flowing out of the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southeastern United States. A few storms will have the potential
to turn severe from the Lower Ohio Valley to the Southeast this
evening, particularly across middle Tennessee, northeast Alabama,
and northwest Georgia. Otherwise, the main concern overnight and
into the day on Thursday will be the possibility of flash
flooding. Numerous parts of the Southeast, central Gulf Coast, and
Southern Appalachians have seen more than double their normal
rainfall over the last week. This leaves soil and ground
conditions extremely susceptible to flooding if areas of heavy
rain develop. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive Rainfall is
in effect through Thursday morning across parts of the Florida
Panhandle and southern Appalachians. The threat of flash flooding
remains across the Southern Appalachians on Thursday, with a
Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall in effect for parts of western
North Carolina, Upstate South Carolina, and far northeastern
Georgia. The aforementioned upper-level low is forecast to finally
lift north and into the Midwest by Friday, therefore associated
shower activity is expected to spread into the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley. The stagnant tropical airmass and a developing low
pressure system off the Carolina coast will allow for unsettled
weather to remain across the Southeast through the end of the
week.

Farther west, showers and thunderstorms are also expected to
dampen the Intermountain West and parts of the northern/central
Rockies through at least Friday. A deep upper level trough
extending down the West Coast and a slow moving cold front will
help funnel Pacific moisture into the region. High elevation snow
is also possible, along with isolated flash flooding.

Above average temperatures remain rather pronounced nearly
everywhere east of the Rockies over the next few days. High
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average this afternoon across
the Northern Plains, along with low relative humidity and gusty
winds, could lead to Critical Fire Weather. Red Flag Warnings have
been issued for the western Dakotas and eastern Montana to
highlight the concern for potential wildfires to spread
uncontrollably. While temperatures gradually cool to near normal
across the Northern Plains by Friday, thanks to an approaching
cold front, thermometers are set to continue rising across the
Southern and Central Plains. In fact, high temperatures may reach
back into the 90s across parts of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas on
Friday.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle of next week...

...Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

For a medium range forecast, there's actually really good
agreement through the entire period on the overall large scale
setup which features a shortwave/closed low lifting through the
southern Plains early next week, while troughing amplifies over
the West and a well defined low pressure system emerges into the
Central Plains by the middle of next week. There remains some
relatively minor timing and detail differences, but these kinds of
uncertainties may take until the short range to resolve. The WPC
forecast used a general blend of the operational models (06z GFS,
00z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) through day 5. For days 6 and 7, increased
contributions from the ensemble menas to help mitigate those
smaller scale uncertainties. This maintains good continuity with
the previous WPC forecast helping to increase confidence some in
the pattern and relevant weather hazards.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

While a lingering rainfall axis will continue into the weekend
from the Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians to the Great Lakes, the
focus this weekend should shift to the coast/offshore where a
frontal boundary and area of low pressure, with limited tropical
development probabilities, could bring some heavy downpours to
portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks and southeast Virginia.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their day extended outlook. The system should then begin
lifting and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with
mainly light to moderate precipitation.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 25-30 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies beginning on Sunday. A
low pressure system should eject out of the Rockies into the
Plains, with increasing confidence in potentially heavy snowfall
within an emerging deformation area on the back/west side of the
low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible to the north of the low, with some mixing of
snow not out of the question during the colder overnight hours.
Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and northern
Plains by Wednesday of next week as the surface low deepens
through the central U.S.. Across the central and southern Plains,
moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with another threat
for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as highlighted in the
latest SPC extended outlook.

00z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET) through day 5. For days 6 and 7, increased
contributions from the ensemble menas to help mitigate those
smaller scale uncertainties. This maintains good continuity with
the previous WPC forecast helping to increase confidence some in
the pattern and relevant weather hazards.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

While a lingering rainfall axis will continue into the weekend
from the Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians to the Great Lakes, the
focus this weekend should shift to the coast/offshore where a
frontal boundary and area of low pressure, with limited tropical
development probabilities, could bring some heavy downpours to
portions of the North Carolina Outer Banks and southeast Virginia.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their day extended outlook. The system should then begin
lifting and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with
mainly light to moderate precipitation.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 25-30 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the northern Rockies beginning on Sunday. A
low pressure system should eject out of the Rockies into the
Plains, with increasing confidence in potentially heavy snowfall
within an emerging deformation area on the back/west side of the
low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible to the north of the low, with some mixing of
snow not out of the question during the colder overnight hours.
Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and northern
Plains by Wednesday of next week as the surface low deepens
through the central U.S.. Across the central and southern Plains,
moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with another threat
for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as highlighted in the
latest SPC extended outlook.

...First winter storm of the season possible for parts of the
central and northern Rockies by early to middle next week...

...Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

For a medium range forecast, with one main exception there's
actually really good agreement through the entire period on the
overall large scale setup which features a shortwave/closed low
lifting through the southern Plains early next week, while
troughing amplifies over the West and a well defined low pressure
system emerges into the Central Plains by the middle of next week.
There remains some relatively minor timing and detail differences,
but these kinds of uncertainties may take until the short range to
resolve. Overall, the WPC forecast suite was derived from a
composite blend of the deterministic models, ensembles and
National Blend of Models for days 3-7. This maintains good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast helping to increase
confidence some in the pattern and relevant weather hazards. The
one main exception is over the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Sun/Mon
where the 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian and to a lesser extent ECMWF
ensembles wrap much more QPF inland from a western Atlantic low
than the GFS/UKMET/GEFS. WPC continuity, latest NHC guidance, and
latest 00 UTC guidance trends do not favor the 12 UTC
ECMWF/Canadian solution.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

A slow moving frontal boundary and area of low pressure off the
East Coast, with limited tropical development probabilities as per
NHC, offers potential for some heavy downpours into coastal areas
of the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast, especially Sun/Mon. The WPC
product suite minimizes heavier rainfall potential onshore
considering latest NHC system guidance and WPC continuity.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplifying southern stream
upper trough energy should act to focus moisture/instability to
fuel an increasingly favorable convection and organized rainfall
environment Sun/Mon for portions of the Plains, with the SPC
noting a severe weather area across the southern Plains on Sunday
in their day extended outlook. The system should then begin
lifting and shearing over the Midwest/Great Lakes on Tuesday, with
mainly light to moderate precipitation.

troughing and closed upper low development down over the

low. This could bring the first winter storm of the season to
portions of the central and northern Rockies. An axis of heavy
rainfall is possible around and to the north of the low, with some
mixing of snow not out of the question during the colder overnight
hours. Gusty winds may also be possible across the central and
northern Plains by Wednesday and Thursday of next week as the
surface low deepens through the central to northern U.S. and
further enhances precipitation. Across the central and southern
Plains, moderate to locally heavy rainfall is possible with
another threat for severe weather on Tuesday into Wednesday as
highlighted in the latest SPC extended outlook.

Cooler conditions will be present across much of the Western CONUS
today. The exception will be southern Arizona and most of New Mexico
where dry and warm conditions are expected with afternoon minimum
relative humidity in the teens. However, winds are forecast to
remain less than 10 to 12 mph and fuels are still quite moist in
this area, therefore, the fire weather threat should remain low.

Cool conditions are expected to remain across most of the Western
CONUS on Friday with a belt of warmer/drier conditions from
southeast Arizona into New Mexico. Increasing mid-level flow will
overspread the region during the day Friday. Deep mixing is forecast
across this region during the afternoon hours which should bring
some of this stronger flow to the surface with sustained winds
around 15 mph expected in a region with relative humidity around 15
percent. Despite the expectation for dry and breezy conditions,
fuels are moist across the region and therefore, no elevated fire
weather concerns are anticipated.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southern Appalachian through Friday morning...

... Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees above average over the
Plains into the Upper Midwest...

An upper-level low currently over the Middle Mississippi Valley
will slowly move northward to the Great Lakes by Friday.  The
circulation around the upper-level low will stream moisture
northward over the Central Gulf Coast to the Southeast, extending
into roughly the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes on Thursday and coming to
an end by Saturday.  The moisture will aid in producing showers
and thunderstorms over the Central Gulf Coast/Southeast into the
Ohio Valley/Great Lakes, producing heavy rain in some areas
through Friday.

Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Southern Appalachian through Friday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers. The threat of excessive rainfall will
lessen on Friday into Saturday to a Marginal Risk over parts of
the Central Appalachians/southern Mid-Atlantic. In addition, on
Thursday, showers and thunderstorms will extend into parts of the
Great Lakes/Upper Mississippi Valley.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern High Plains
southwestward to Great Basin will slowly move eastward to the
Northern/Central Plains to the Southern Rockies by Saturday.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop along and near
the boundary over parts of the Great Basin into the Northern
Rockies, extending into parts of the Southwest by Friday evening.
Additionally, showers and thunderstorms will develop near the
boundary over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Northern
Plains on Friday, continuing into Saturday morning.

Furthermore, an upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the
Upper Midwest as temperatures will become 10 to 20 degrees above
average over parts of the Plains into the Upper Midwest.

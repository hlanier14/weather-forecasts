Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CST Mon Nov 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0156 AM CST Mon Nov 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging across the Great Basin will begin to weak today as
a shortwave trough approaches the Pacific Northwest. Strong flow
aloft will overspread the Rockies as a cold front moves south out of
Canada. Ahead of the front, strong downslope winds are expected to
develop along the Front Range through the afternoon. While localized
fire weather potential will exist with the strong winds in the
northern Rockies, elsewhere, fire weather potential will remain low.

...Northern and central Rockies...
As the previously mentioned shortwave trough advances toward the
northern and central Rockies through the day, low-level surface
pressure gradients will tighten substantially in response to the
development of a strong lee trough. Very strong surface gusts
greater than 50 mph will be possible through terrain gaps and in the
adjacent foothills from Montana south, through eastern Wyoming and
onto the Front Range of northern Colorado. While winds will be very
strong, surface humidity values will be slow to fall through day, as
a result of mid-level cloud cover and lingering surface moisture.
Prior day humidity recoveries as high as 80% across portions of the
northern Rockies also suggest fuel availability will be limited to
pockets of fuels generally unfavorable for large fire spread.
Localized fire weather conditions cannot be ruled out given strong
winds and increased drying near topography. However, the spatial
coverage of sustained elevated and critical conditions is expected
to remain too low to include any areas at this time.

...Heavy rain and mountain snow culminate today over the Pacific
Northwest before tapering off tonight...

...A rapidly intensifying low pressure system will bring very high
winds across the northern Rockies today and through the northern
Plains on Tuesday into early Wednesday...

...Areas of Lake Effect enhanced snow downstream of the Great
Lakes will gradually taper off as low pressure system exits New
England...

The tail end of prolonged Atmospheric River event into Washington
is coming with one last strong push as strengthening surface low
across British Columbia helps to accelerate a cold front through
the Pacific Northwest through the early overnight hours tonight
into Tuesday morning.  Due to saturated grounds much of the
rainfall is running off adding to swollen rivers across much of
Western Washington and the Northern Washington Cascades.  Given
the rapid deepening of the low, strong cold winds will support
rapidly reducing freezing levels across the Olympic, northern
Cascade and northern Rockies of ID/MT through tonight supporting
heavy snowfall with 4-8+" in the highest elevations of the
Washington Ranges, with 1-4" across the Northern Rockies.

The storm continues to deepen extreme downslope winds are expected
along the northern MT frontal range with 50-70 mph sustained winds
with gusts of 80-100 mph possible today into tomorrow.  While off
the range into north-central MT, winds of 30-50 gusts to 70 mph
will expand eastward into western ND by Tuesday, resulting in High
Wind Warnings and Red Flag fire concerns.  Winds will remain
elevated as the very strong low pressure center tracks across
southern Canada, through Wednesday,  reducing to 15-30 mph.  The
only positive is the strong down sloping will expand well above
average temperatures across the Rockies, High Plains and into the
Plains today and Tuesday with high temperatures 20-40 degrees
above normal.  By late Tuesday into Wednesday, the associated cold
front will emerge across the northern high plains and bring
temperatures to slightly below average (10-15 degrees) for
Wednesday's highs.  Still, the warm up will slide eastward across
the Mississippi, Ohio Valleys into the Great Lakes, head of the
front though upper 60-70s are expected, about 10-15 degrees above
average.  Rainfall is expected to be very light along the front by
Wednesday but this system is otherwise bone dry until then, with
only precipiation generally across Canada.

Along the eastern U.S., cooler air is in place as the cold front
has crossed off the East Coast as the low deepens across the
Canadian Maritime.  Today's and tomorrow morning's temperatures
will be below normal (10-20 degrees) behind the front. Lingering
Lake Effect plumes downstream of Lake Erie and Ontario are likely
to produce a few inches of snow, but will taper off by late
Tuesday. A steady warm up is expected by late Tuesday into
Wednesday from the Ohio Valley to New England respectively.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance generally agrees that progressive mean flow late this
week should eventually transition toward an amplifying mean trough
over the central-eastern U.S. as a ridge building over the eastern
Pacific during the weekend begins to move into the West early next
week. This evolution should promote a couple surges of chilly air
over the central/eastern states while temperatures over the West
remain near to above normal.

The models and guidance show fairly good agreement on the large
scale evolution during the medium range period, but continue to
offer plenty of variability in the details. Models have trended a
little weaker with a storm expected to track towards the Pacific
Northwest late this week, with the UKMET the weakest and quickest
to eject that energy into southwest Canada/far northern U.S..
After day 4, uncertanity in the evolution of the shortwave as it
crosses into the Central U.S. this weekend and eventually
amplifies over the East early next week is high as several pieces
of energy rotate through the trough to help amplify and reinforce
the troughing as it enters the East next Monday. This tempers
confidence in the details of the general area of lower pressure
and one or more fronts crossing the central into Eastern U.S. this
weekend. There is enough ensemble support to mention potential
development of a deep cyclone to impact parts of the Northeast or
New England early next week/just beyond the medium range period.
However, the model spread for timing and intensity of this feature
remains too high to be able to talk about specific impacts this
may (or may not) have on the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel
week.

The WPC forecast used a general model blend of the 06z GFS with
the 00z ECMWF and CMC as the basis for the forecast days 3-4.
After this, added and gradually increased contributions from the
ensemble means to help mitigate some of the harder to resolve
detail differences. This also maintains decent continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Strong low pressure tracking over eastern Canada should bring
brisk winds to areas from the Upper Midwest into the Northeast
Thursday-Friday while light to moderate precipitation (mostly
rain) will accompany the trailing front crossing the eastern U.S..
Northern and eastern portions of the Great Lakes should see a
period of lake effect precipitation after the frontal passage.
Meanwhile the southern Florida Peninsula may experience locally
moderate to heavy rainfall around Thursday as moisture interacts
with a stalled front to the south and another front approaching
from the northwest. Continued spread and variability in guidance
for the system approaching the West Coast late this week keep
confidence lower than desired for the specifics of rain and higher
elevation snow that should spread across the central/northern West
Coast into the northern Rockies. Upstream moisture may keep some
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest through the
weekend. As shortwave energy continues eastward, expect another
area of rain to develop from the southern Plains
eastward/northeastward from the weekend into early next week ahead
of one or more cold fronts but again with low confidence for
coverage and amounts at this time. Precipitation could change to
snow over the farthest north latitudes with reinforcing cold air.


Areas near the East Coast will see temperatures up to 10-15F above
normal on Thursday ahead of an advancing cold front. The cooling
trend behind this front will bring generally 5-12F below normal
readings from the Plains into the East Thursday-Saturday. Upstream
system progression may bring a brief episode of warmth from the
West into the High Plains late this week, peaking with some highs
10-15F above normal over the central High Plains on Friday.
Another push of cold air should extend southeastward from the
northern Plains Sunday-Monday with highs 5-10F below normal.

0151 PM CST Mon Nov 15 2021

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO INTO TEXAS
SOUTH PLAINS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 11/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CST Mon Nov 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low/trough will move eastward Day2/Tuesday across southern
Canada and the northern Rockies while mid-level ridging develops
across the eastern US. A cold front associated with the trough will
move south out of Canada and into the northern Plains late in the
period. Strong surface winds are expected ahead of the trough and
cold front supporting critical fire weather conditions across
portions of the southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Eastern New Mexico and portions of the southern High Plains...
Similar to Day1/Monday, the increasing flow aloft perpendicular to
the higher terrain will support the development of a strong lee
trough/low across eastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado. In
response, west-east surface pressure gradients will quickly
strengthen through the day, supporting strong westerly surface flow.
Enhanced by the strengthening flow aloft and topography, widespread
winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are likely from eastern New
Mexico into portions of southern Colorado and West Texas.
Unseasonably warm temperatures and strong downsloping will favor low
humidity values with widespread surface RH less than 10% expected
through the afternoon. Favorable meteorological conditions will
overlap with drying grassy fuels supportive of fire spread. As a
result, widespread elevated to critical fire weather conditions are
forecast to develop across portions of eastern New Mexico and the
southern High Plains Day2/Tuesday. Fire weather concerns will
diminish quickly overnight as surface temperatures cool ahead of a
fast moving cold front.

...Central Plains...
Low-end fire weather potential may also develop for a few hours
behind the fast moving cold front across portions of the Dakotas and
eastern Wyoming. Strong winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are
forecast to continue as they shift to the northwest through the day.
Uncertainty remains on the coverage of low surface humidity with
cooler temperatures expected behind the front. Current ensemble
guidance suggests minimum RH may struggle to get below 25% despite
the strong winds. Locally elevated fire weather conditions may
develop where humidity remains less than 25% and grassy fuels exist,
though forecast confidence is low.

300 PM EST Mon November 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 21 - 25 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across most of the forecast domain during the 6 to 10 d=
ay
period. Models predict a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over
eastern Siberia and a trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies over the
Alaska Mainland. A ridge is predicted over the eastern North Pacific extend=
ing
into the western CONUS. A negative NAO pattern is predicted, with a strong
positive 500-hPa height anomaly over the North Atlantic and a trough and
negative 500-hPa height anomalies over much of the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored across Alaska, under a predicted trou=
gh
and negative 500-hPa height anomalies, with greater probabilities over the
western Mainland Alaska under anomalous northerly flow. Above normal
temperatures are more likely for the western CONUS, under a predicted ridge
and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored fo=
r
much of the eastern CONUS, from the Great Lakes region southeastward across
the
Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region to the southeast Atlantic coast, under =
a
predicted trough. Near normal temperatures are favored for New England unde=
r
southerly flow ahead of the predicted trough.

Below normal precipitation is favored for the western Alaska Mainland under
anomalous northerly flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle with onshore flow ahe=
ad
of the trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for much of th=
e
western CONUS under a predicted ridge. Below normal precipitation is favore=
d
for parts of the Central Plains, consistent with the consolidation
precipitation tool. Above normal precipitation is favored from the western
Gulf
Coast northeastward through the Ohio Valley into the Northeast, along a
predicted storm track. Above normal precipitation is also favored for north=
ern
areas of the Northern Plains, due to anticipated moisture flow from the
Pacific
overtop of the predicted ridge.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the average large-scale circulation
pattern,
offset by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 23 - 29 2021

A similar 500-hPa circulation pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is
predicted during the week 2 period. A ridge is predicted over eastern Siber=
ia,
while a trough is predicted over the Alaska Mainland. A ridge is predicted =
to
persist over the eastern North Pacific and western CONUS. The trough over t=
he
eastern CONUS is forecast to deepen and progress slightly eastward in the w=
eek
2 period. The predicted temperature and precipitation patterns for the week=
 2
period also resemble the 6-10 day period forecasts.

Below normal temperatures are favored for most of Alaska under a predicted
trough, while near normal temperatures are more likely for the southern Ala=
ska
Panhandle in the week 2 period, as uncertainty increases. Above normal
temperatures continue to be likely for the western CONUS, under a predicted
ridge. Below normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS, excludi=
ng
New England, under the predicted trough and a predicted negative NAO patter=
n.

Below normal precipitation continues to be favored for western Alaska, unde=
r
anomalous northerly flow, while above normal precipitation is favored for
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, ahead of the predict=
ed
trough. Below normal precipitation continues to be favored for much of the
western CONUS, with a slight tilt in probabilities towards below normal
precipitation for parts of the Central and Southern Plains, under the
predicted
ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Northern Rock=
ies
into the Northern Plains, due to anticipated Pacific flow overtop of the
predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation is likely for New England ahead=
 of
the predicted trough, while near normal precipitation is favored for most o=

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified, progressive mid-level pattern is forecast at the
beginning of week-2, with mid-level low pressure across the eastern third o=
f
the contiguous U.S. supporting increased chances of much below normal
temperatures to the region. This pattern may support a strong surface low
tracking from the Ohio Valley from the end of week-1 to the Northeast by th=
e
start of week-2, increasing chances for heavy precipitation and high winds =
to
parts of the northeastern lower 48 at the beginning of the period. By the
middle of the period, the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means favor
mid-level low (high) pressure across the eastern (western) half of the lowe=
r
48. Mid-level low pressure is predicted to dominate Alaska throughout week-=
2,
bringing anomalously cool temperatures to the state. A strong surface low o=
ver
the Gulf of Alaska may bring heavy precipitation to the Alaska Panhandle at
the
beginning of the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the eastern
third
of the CONUS, Tue-Wed, Nov 23-24.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Central
Appalachians, and Northeast, Tue-Wed, Nov 23-24.

Slight risk of high winds across part of the Great Lakes, Northeast, Centra=
l
Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Tue-Wed, Nov 23-24.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of western Mainl=
and
Alaska, Tue-Thu, Nov 23-25.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Alaska Panhandle,
Tue-Thu, Nov 23-25.

FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER 23 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 29: An amplified trough is predic=
ted
to move across the eastern third of the CONUS from the end of week-1 into t=
he
beginning of week-2. This feature may support increased chances for much be=
low
normal temperatures to parts of the eastern third of the CONUS, Nov 23 to 2=
4.
The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minim=
um
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below freezing. Thes=
e
colder temperatures may usher in the first freezing temperatures for parts =
of
the Southeast.



The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means all generally indicate surf=
ace
low formation over the Northeast ahead of this mid-level trough. Recent run=
s
of
the deterministic GFS indicate potential formation of a strong surface low
tracking from the Ohio valley to the Northeast at the beginning of the peri=
od,
while an additional surface low forming along the Mid-Atlantic coast tracki=
ng
near the coast of the Northeast. The deterministic 12Z ECMWF indicates a mu=
ch
stronger surface low that is more in line with the deterministic GFS compar=
ed
to the 0Z ECMWF. The reforecast tools do not indicate elevated chances for
precipitation exceeding hazardous thresholds. However, due to good run to r=
un
model consistency between recent deterministic GFS runs, good agreement wit=
h
the 12Z ECMWF, and the potential for this storm being a high impact event
during a heavy travel period leading up to Thanksgiving, related hazards ar=
e
posted across parts of the northeastern CONUS. A slight risk of heavy snow =
is
posted for parts of the Great Lakes , Ohio Valley, Central Appalachians, an=
d
Northeast, and a slight risk of high winds is highlighted for parts of the
Great Lakes, Northeast, Central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Nov 23 to 2=
4.
Localized areas may experience liquid equivalent totals exceeding one inch =
in
24-hours and sustained wind speeds exceeding 25 mph.



Multiple daily ensemble means (0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian) indicate
potential
surface low formation across the Great Plains. This feature in addition to
onshore moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico associated with surface high
pressure building across the eastern third of the CONUS behind the exiting
storm in the Northeast, may bring localized heavy precipitation to parts of
the
Lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee valley. The reforecast tools indicat=
e
at
least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile a=
nd
one inch during the 8 to 12 day period. The uncalibrated 6Z and 12Z GEFS
favors
day 10 (Nov 25) with the greatest chance for heaviest precipitation. Due to
significant model uncertainty regarding rainfall totals, a related heavy
rainfall hazard is not posted at this time.



Amplified mid-level troughing across Mainland Alaska from the beginning to
middle of the period supports a slight risk of much below normal temperatur=
es
across parts of the western Mainland. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is designated for parts of western mainland Alaska, where both
the
GEFS and ECMWF tools indicate at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below zero Deg F.



There is good multi-model depiction of a strong surface low forming over th=
e
Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of the period, which could bring heavy
precipitation to parts of the Alaska panhandle. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for the Alaska Panhandle, Nov 23 to 25 where the
reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of exceeding the 85th percentil=
e
and 2 inches. Localized higher elevation areas may experience heavy
precipitation in the form of snow. A heavy snow hazard is not specified due=
 to
inherent difficulty in identifying these specific areas.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance generally agrees that progressive mean flow late this
week should eventually transition toward an amplifying mean trough
over the central-eastern U.S. as a ridge building over the eastern
Pacific during the weekend begins to move into the West early next
week. This evolution should promote a couple surges of chilly air
over the central/eastern states while temperatures over the West
remain near to above normal.

The models and guidance show fairly good agreement on the large
scale evolution during the medium range period, but continue to
offer plenty of variability in the details. Models have trended a
little weaker with a storm expected to track towards the Pacific
Northwest late this week, with the UKMET the weakest and quickest
to eject that energy into southwest Canada/far northern U.S..
After day 4, uncertanity in the evolution of the shortwave as it
crosses into the Central U.S. this weekend and eventually
amplifies over the East early next week is high as several pieces
of energy rotate through the trough to help amplify and reinforce
the troughing as it enters the East next Monday. This tempers
confidence in the details of the general area of lower pressure
and one or more fronts crossing the central into Eastern U.S. this
weekend. There is enough ensemble support to mention potential
development of a deep cyclone to impact parts of the Northeast or
New England early next week/just beyond the medium range period.
However, the model spread for timing and intensity of this feature
remains too high to be able to talk about specific impacts this
may (or may not) have on the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel
week.

The WPC forecast used a general model blend of the 06z GFS with
the 00z ECMWF and CMC as the basis for the forecast days 3-4.
After this, added and gradually increased contributions from the
ensemble means to help mitigate some of the harder to resolve
detail differences. This also maintains decent continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Strong low pressure tracking over eastern Canada should bring
brisk winds to areas from the Upper Midwest into the Northeast
Thursday-Friday while light to moderate precipitation (mostly
rain) will accompany the trailing front crossing the eastern U.S..
Northern and eastern portions of the Great Lakes should see a
period of lake effect precipitation after the frontal passage.
Meanwhile the southern Florida Peninsula may experience locally
moderate to heavy rainfall around Thursday as moisture interacts
with a stalled front to the south and another front approaching
from the northwest. Continued spread and variability in guidance
for the system approaching the West Coast late this week keep
confidence lower than desired for the specifics of rain and higher
elevation snow that should spread across the central/northern West
Coast into the northern Rockies. Upstream moisture may keep some
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest through the
weekend. As shortwave energy continues eastward, expect another
area of rain to develop from the southern Plains
eastward/northeastward from the weekend into early next week ahead
of one or more cold fronts but again with low confidence for
coverage and amounts at this time. Precipitation could change to
snow over the farthest north latitudes with reinforcing cold air.


Areas near the East Coast will see temperatures up to 10-15F above
normal on Thursday ahead of an advancing cold front. The cooling
trend behind this front will bring generally 5-12F below normal
readings from the Plains into the East Thursday-Saturday. Upstream
system progression may bring a brief episode of warmth from the
West into the High Plains late this week, peaking with some highs
10-15F above normal over the central High Plains on Friday.
Another push of cold air should extend southeastward from the
northern Plains Sunday-Monday with highs 5-10F below normal.

158 AM EST Tue Nov 16 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 19 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 23 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The overall forecast is consistent in advertising a transition
from relatively flat and progressive mean flow late this week to a
more amplified pattern during the weekend and early next week as a
deepening upper trough heads into the East downstream from a ridge
that moves into the West by Monday. The upper trough and a
possible embedded low may support potentially significant low
pressure that would affect portions of the East, and requires
monitoring given the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel week.
Meanwhile it looks increasingly likely that initially weak
southern stream Pacific energy will collect into an upper low to
the west/south of California. This feature may approach or reach
the southwestern U.S. by next Tuesday. The expected pattern will
produce two surges of chilly air over the eastern half of the
country, one during Friday-Saturday and another early next week,
while maintaining mostly above normal temperatures from the West
into parts of the High Plains.

After a lot of spread and variability over recent days, model
clustering is decent but still not ideal for the system expected
to reach just inland over the Pacific Northwest at the start of
the period early Friday. 12Z/18Z GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF/CMC
provided the most comparable solutions through the 18Z cycle while
the 12Z UKMET was weak and suppressed. The new 00Z UKMET is closer
to the other models but the 00Z ECMWF has now become the
weak/south extreme.

Detail differences with this system's energy as well as for
upstream flow digging into the amplifying mean trough maintain a
fair degree of uncertainty for the specifics of one or more
surface lows and frontal systems over the central and eastern U.S.
from Saturday through Tuesday. This has supported a model/ensemble
mean blend approach to tone down differences and run-to-run
variability seen in the operational models. As for potentially
stronger development near the East Coast by day 7 Tuesday, thus
far there has been a decent signal for a storm system but within a
broad area encompassing the Great Lakes to Mid-Atlantic through
the Northeast, Canadian Maritimes, and western Atlantic. At this
time an intermediate surface low position just off southeastern
New England as of 12Z Tuesday provides a reasonable starting point
relative to the models/ensemble means. This is somewhat closer to
the ECMWF mean that has been fairly stable over its past three
runs in contrast to the GEFS mean that has trended southward since
yesterday (but has been steady near the southern tip of Nova
Scotia in the past 12 hours of runs). The 12Z CMC mean was well
offshore with the surface low but the new run has trended farther
northwest for early Tuesday. The southern track of the 12Z ECMWF
deep upper low near the East Coast led to some 500mb height
anomalies of 5-6 standard deviations below normal while the
anomalies in other models are somewhat less extreme. The new 00Z
ECMWF is a tad weaker as of early Tuesday.

Question marks upstream late in the period involve the next
Pacific shortwave scheduled to arrive into the West around late
Monday-Tuesday, along with what becomes of the upper low expected
to form offshore from the southwestern U.S.  Consensus indicates
the 12Z CMC was too amplified with the northern stream shortwave
and indeed the new 00Z run has toned it down somewhat. Prior
GFS/CMC runs were fastest to eject the upper low energy into the
West and the new 00Z runs have trended slower.

Best model clustering favored use of the 12Z ECMWF/CMC and 18Z GFS
as the basis of the updated forecast early in the period. Ongoing
detail uncertainties with shortwaves digging into the eventual
eastern U.S. trough and eventual straying of the 12Z CMC from
consensus recommended a transition to a mix of the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means with lingering input of the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The system forecast to reach the Northwest by early Friday should
spread light to moderate rain/mountain snow from the northern half
of the West Coast through the northern Rockies. After Friday much
of the West will see multiple dry days aside from some moisture
returning to the northern Pacific Northwest Sunday onward and
possibly some scattered precipitation reaching southern parts of
the West by Tuesday ahead of the upper low that forms southwest of
California. The eastern Great Lakes could see some lingering lake
effect activity on Friday. Expect precipitation to expand in
coverage over the eastern half of the country from Sunday onward
in association with one or more surface lows/frontal systems. It
is too early to resolve detailed effects from low pressure that
may be near the East Coast by next Tuesday but significant
rain/snow and strong winds could be possible. At this time the
relatively higher potential for meaningful snow extends from the
central Appalachians through interior New England. The broad
cyclonic circulation and cold air may produce some lake
effect/enhancement as well. Easterly flow from late week through
the weekend may promote periods of rain over the southern/eastern
parts of the Florida Peninsula.

Much of the eastern U.S. will see below normal temperatures Friday
into Saturday with some highs 10F or more below normal on Friday.
Another surge of chilly air will likely bring highs over the East
back down to 5-15F below normal next Monday-Tuesday. Anomalies
could trend colder depending on the ultimate depth of the upper
trough crossing the region. On the other hand the central/southern
High Plains may see highs up to 10-15F above normal Friday into
Saturday and again next Tuesday. Expect moderately above normal
temperatures over many areas from the Rockies to the West Coast
through the period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0153 AM CST Tue Nov 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND
WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a trough/upper low across the northern Rockies
will move eastward, ejecting onto the northern Plains by early
evening. At the surface, a lee low will develop across the southern
High Plains ahead of a fast-moving cold front associated with the
upper trough. Strong winds ahead of and behind the front will
support several areas of fire weather potential from the
northern/central Plains to the southern Rockies.

...Southern Rockies and High Plains...
As increasing mid-level flow ahead of the trough/upper low over the
northern Rockies spreads eastward, dry westerly flow is forecast to
increase through the day. Unseasonably warm temperatures and ongoing
dry conditions across much of the southern Rockies/High Plains will
favor widespread diurnal minimum relative humidity values of 8-15%.
Coincident with the decreasing humidity, surface winds will
strengthen to 15-20 mph in response to increased momentum transfer
from deep vertical mixing and growing flow aloft. Widespread
elevated fire weather conditions appear likely given the favorable
overlap of dry and windy conditions with dry fuels across portions
of southern CO, eastern NM, and western OK/TX.

A corridor of enhanced 850-700 mb flow also appears likely to
develop across portions of eastern NM and west TX ahead of the
southern branch of the approaching trough, as well as in response to
tightening surface pressure gradients behind the developing lee low.
Here, winds of 25-35 mph and greater gusts appear likely through the
afternoon and into the evening. Given the presence of very warm/dry
surface conditions along with the stronger winds, high confidence
exists in the development of widespread critical fire weather
conditions within this zone.

...Central High Plains...
Less certainty exists on the potential for fire weather conditions
ahead of and behind the fast-moving cold front sweeping south across
the central High Plains. Very strong surface winds with gusts of 40+
mph are expected from eastern WY through portions of NE and SD.
However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding the development
of low relative humidity across the region. Cloud cover ahead of the
front may limit diurnal minimum RH to around 25%. This suggests
coverage and duration of elevated fire weather conditions may be
limited. However, given the presence of at least marginally
supportive fuel loads and very strong winds, an elevated area was
added to account for brief elevated fire weather potential.

Behind the front, rapidly cooling surface temperatures and cloud
cover may also limit the coverage and duration of low relative
humidity, mainly across portions of northern/western SD. Here,
surface RH should quickly rise after frontal passage, before falling
again as the drier and cooler airmass moves in. At least brief
elevated fire weather conditions will be possible through early
evening, but forecast uncertainty on the coverage and duration of
sustained conditions remains high. Though winds will remain gusty,
fire weather concerns will diminish overnight as higher RH and
cooler temperatures settle in across portions of the central Plains.

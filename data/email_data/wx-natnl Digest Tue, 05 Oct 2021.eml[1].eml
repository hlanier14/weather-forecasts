Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

The latest guidance consensus suggests that the previous forecast
remains on track (please see the previous forecast below for more
details). In addition, locally Elevated conditions also appear
possible across portions of the northern Rockies, from the Sawtooth
Range in central Idaho to Yellowstone Country in southern Montana.
During the afternoon, patchy areas of 15 mph sustained southwesterly
winds will overlap with 15-25% RH atop fuels that remain highly
receptive to fire spread. However, the localized and brief nature of
these Elevated conditions preclude Elevated highlights.

..Squitieri.. 10/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1227 AM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest,
allowing broad southwesterly mid-level flow to overspread adjacent
areas of the northern Great Basin, northern Rockies, and northern
High Plains. Despite somewhat marginal flow aloft, afternoon
heating/mixing should allow for enough vertical momentum transfer to
produce wind/RH combos sufficient for elevated fire-weather concerns
across portions of the aforementioned regions.

...Northern High Plains...
Southerly winds approaching sustained values of 15 mph should
develop by mid afternoon over the region. Meanwhile, temperatures
should warm into the 80s F while dew point temperatures remain in
the 20s F, allowing for large dew point depressions and RH values
into the teens and single digits. This will result in elevated
fire-weather conditions amid fuels which remain receptive to
large-fire spread.

...Northern Great Basin...
Southwesterly sustained winds near 15 mph should develop during the
afternoon while RH values fall into the 10%-20% range. Fuels remain
critically dry across the region. Thus, elevated fire-weather
highlights have been maintained, with a small expansion into
portions of central Oregon.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 04 2021

SYNOPSIS: Hazardous weather potential during Week-2 appears predominantly t=
ied
to an area of mid-level low pressure forecast across the West at the outset=
 of
the period. This low pressure center is likely to align with an area of
increased chances for much below-normal temperatures. Out ahead of the
mid-level low, high winds are possible for much of the High Plains and Four
Corners region, while heavy precipitation potential exists for the Northern
Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley. By mid-October confidence in hazardous
weather declines as model guidance diverges on the fate of the mid-level lo=
w,
with whether it slowly shifts east or drifts back over the Pacific and wash=
es
out. Some risk for much below-normal temperatures from the mid-level low co=
uld
spill into the Alaska Panhandle near the beginning of Week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest, Tue-Thu, Oct 12-14.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for most areas located betwee=
n
the Pacific Coastline and High Plains, Tue-Mon, Oct 12-18.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Dakotas, Minnesota, and
Nebraska,
Tue-Thu, Oct 12-14.

Slight risk of heavy snow for portions of Montana, Wyoming, and extreme
Northern Colorado, Tue-Wed, Oct 12-13.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Four Corners region, Great
Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Tue-Thu, Oct 12-14.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Alaska
Panhandle, Tue-Wed, Oct 12-13.

least
a 40% chance of daily lows in the bottom 15% of climatological values) is
supported by GEFS and ECMWF reforecast guidance extending from the Great Ba=
sin
through the Rockies on the 12th through 14th. Model guidance diverges on th=
e
handling of the cold air as Week-2 progresses, with the GEFS showing the
trough
retrograding over the Pacific and weakening, while the ECMWF pushes the col=
d
slowly eastward and holds on to the anomalously cold temperatures longer.
Given
the uncertainty between these perspectives, a slight risk of much below-nor=
mal
temperatures is posted throughout Week-2 for a broad area from the Pacific
Coastline through the High Plains where overnight lows could fall below 40
degrees F (roughly corresponding to frost potential). Of note is that the
ECMWF
brings the anomalous cold further east early in Week-2, and would support a
moderate risk of much-below normal temperatures extending across much of th=
e
Great Plains through the 14th, while not even a slight risk of much
below-normal temperatures is posted here. The rationale for this omission (=
in
addition to lesser signals from the GEFS) is for continuity with the Extend=
ed
Range Outlook where forecast warmth early during Days 6-10 is likely to dwa=
rf
the late period cooler air, and the uncertainty later in the Days 8-14 peri=
od
again limits cold potential from a weekly mean perspective.



Longwave troughing over the West favors the potential for high winds to the
immediate south and east of the synoptic feature. As such, a slight risk fo=
r
high winds (sustained winds above 30 mph or gusts exceeding 45 mph) is post=
ed
on the 12th through 14th for the Four Corners, High Plains, and Upper
Mississippi Valley. Given the uncertainty regarding the synoptic pattern
described in the preceding paragraph, the wind hazard duration is limited t=
o
the first three days of the forecast period. Model guidance also anticipate=
s
lee cyclogenesis over the Central High Plains near the beginning of the
period,
with a likely track of the surface low toward the Upper Mississippi Valley
through Mid-October. As such, a slight risk of heavy rain (>20% chance of a=
t
least 1 inch falling within 24 hours) is posted for the 12th through 14th
across parts of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Minnesota. On the backside of th=
e
prospective system, a slight risk for heavy snow (12+ inches in 24 hours) i=
s
possible across portions of eastern Montana, Wyoming, and extreme northern
Colorado on the 12th and 13th. As with the other hazards, duration and
location
of any subsequent heavy precipitation or high winds beyond the 14th is tied=
 to
the evolution of the longwave pattern and its associated shortwaves initiat=
ing
cyclogenesis downstream of the Rockies.



While not highlighted on the forecast map, there is some potential for much
above-normal temperatures focused over the Midwest early in the period in t=
he
warm sector of the system developing downstream of the Rockies. Despite mut=
ed
ECMWF signals, GEFS reforecast guidance shows a better than 10% chance of
daily
record highs over the Corn Belt on the 12th and Great Lakes the following d=
ay.
These temperatures would likely correspond to daily high temperatures in th=
e
80s (degrees F) that are not particularly hazardous, but could be noteworth=
y
from a record-keeping perspective.



The troughing impacting the West could bring a brief cold period to the Ala=
ska
Panhandle early on. Reforecast guidance supports a slight risk of much
below-normal temperatures here on the 12th and 13th before the signal begin=
s
to
wane. The anomalous troughing amplitude across Alaska is nowhere near that
anticipated over the Lower-48, although a slight cold tilt is anticipated f=

the state during Week-2. Precipitation signals across Alaska throughout the
period are generally weak and incoherent.



The tropics in the Atlantic appear fairly quiet the next couple weeks with =
the
intraseasonal state in transition over the basin. An atmospheric Kelvin wav=

is
forecast to cross the main development region during the next few days whic=

could briefly enhance cyclogenesis potential, while the more favorable

GEFS which has a handful of members spinning up a system near the Windward

0147 PM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

Portions of the Elevated area across the Pacific Northwest was
expanded northeastward to the Oregon/Idaho border. The Northern
Rockies/High Plains Elevated has also been expanded southwestward
into central Idaho. Both expansions were made to reflect the latest
guidance consensus. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on
track. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 10/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CDT Mon Oct 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will continue to move onshore and overspread
portions of the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, a closed upper-level
low over Southern California will lift northeast and merge with the
aforementioned trough over portions of the central Rockies. A broad
zone of moderate to modest mid-level southwesterly flow will be
present over much of the West.

...Northern High Plains...
Conditions will be similar to those forecast on D1/Monday, albeit
with southwesterly oriented surface winds. Warm/dry conditions will
prevail, and sustained winds approaching 15 mph developing for a few
hours during the afternoon, resulting in elevated fire-weather
conditions.

...Pacific Northwest...
With the approaching trough, enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow
near 50-60 kt will overspread the region. This will help foster
sustained surface winds near 20 mph across the region, while RH
values fall into the low 20s, during the afternoon. Critically dry
fuels remain present across the region, supporting the introduction
of an elevated fire-weather designation.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians late-week Heavy Rain Threat...


...Overview...

The medium range period will feature a closed upper low being slow
to depart the eastern U.S. where unsettled weather is expected to
prevail.  Meanwhile, an upper ridge over the north-central states
will give way to a couple of wavy cold fronts that is forecast to
move across the western U.S. where moderate precipitation chances
and high-elevation wintry precipitation are expected.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to offer fairly good agreement on the synoptic
scale pattern across the U.S. despite the difficult-to-handle
upper low meandering over the east-central U.S. into the weekend.
There continues to be a gradual tendency for the models to slow
the eastward progress of the rainfall ahead of the upper low
across the Ohio Valley and the southern Appalachians late this
week.  There is also decent model agreement for a low pressure
wave to form near the Carolina coasts this weekend, followed by a
track toward the northeast just off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

Models have come into better agreement with the timing of a
developing low pressure system forecast to track across the
northern Plains this weekend.  A period of high-elevation wintry
precipitation is indicated over the northern Rockies late Friday
to early Saturday prior to the formation of the low with very good
model agreement.  By early next week, models indicate decent
agreement for another low pressure wave forming in the central
Plains as southern stream energy ejects from the
Southwest/southern Rockies to the southern Plains.  Finally, the
next round of precipitation is forecast to move into the Pacific
Northwest early next week with the approach of the next upper
trough.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite
blend of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean with the 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean.  This maintains good WPC continuity as well as
compatible with the latest (12 UTC) model outputs.  The CMC has
not been included since it deviated significantly from the
GFS/ECMWF general blen.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a
frontal system as it slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
for several days, with enhanced focus ahead of a closed upper low
late this week across the southern Appalachians and into the
interior Mid-Atlantic, where terrain enhancement will also be a
factor.  Models are trending toward drier conditions for interior
new England as a low pressure wave focuses precip near or just off
the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts this weekend into early
next week.

A couple of developing waves will likely bring a period of
rainfall over the northern and central Plains by this weekend.  A
wavy cold front digging slowly but robustly across the West will
spread areas of rain gradually southeastward mid-later week and
the weekend, eventually working across the Rockies into the
north-central states.  Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, along with snow at higher elevations.  The
West should trend cooler with time as the upper trough approaches
and the cold front makes its way through the region.  Daytime
highs by later next week could be 5-15 degrees below normal for
some locations. Downstream upper ridging traversing the
north-central U.S. will support warmer than average temperatures
across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week with some plus
10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the emerging closed
upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the Southeast/East
should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but also maintain
decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning
lows.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 10 - 14 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A weak trough is forecast over eastern Siberia and Bering
Sea,
while a ridge is predicted south of the Alaska Peninsula. A deep trough wit=
h
below normal 500-hPa heights and mean cyclonic flow are expected across mos=
t
of
the western half of the CONUS. Strong ridging with above normal heights are
forecast farther to the east across much of northeastern North America. The
manual 500-hPa height blend, based primarily on the ensemble means from the
GEFS and ECMWF, depicts above normal heights across the Aleutians and parts=
 of
the southwestern Mainland Alaska. Conversely, near to below normal heights =
are
favored for much of the remainder of Alaska.

With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal
temperatures are favored over western CONUS underneath predicted troughing =
and
below normal 500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Southeast/Southern Appalachians late-week Heavy Rain Threat...


...Overview...

The medium range period will feature a closed upper low being slow
to depart the eastern U.S. where unsettled weather is expected to
prevail.  Meanwhile, an upper ridge over the north-central states
will give way to a couple of wavy cold fronts that is forecast to
move across the western U.S. where moderate precipitation chances
and high-elevation wintry precipitation are expected.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance continues to offer fairly good agreement on the synoptic
scale pattern across the U.S. despite the difficult-to-handle
upper low meandering over the east-central U.S. into the weekend.
There continues to be a gradual tendency for the models to slow
the eastward progress of the rainfall ahead of the upper low
across the Ohio Valley and the southern Appalachians late this
week.  There is also decent model agreement for a low pressure
wave to form near the Carolina coasts this weekend, followed by a
track toward the northeast just off the Mid-Atlantic coast.

Models have come into better agreement with the timing of a
developing low pressure system forecast to track across the
northern Plains this weekend.  A period of high-elevation wintry
precipitation is indicated over the northern Rockies late Friday
to early Saturday prior to the formation of the low with very good
model agreement.  By early next week, models indicate decent
agreement for another low pressure wave forming in the central
Plains as southern stream energy ejects from the
Southwest/southern Rockies to the southern Plains.  Finally, the
next round of precipitation is forecast to move into the Pacific
Northwest early next week with the approach of the next upper
trough.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite
blend of the 06 UTC GFS/GEFS mean with the 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean.  This maintains good WPC continuity as well as
compatible with the latest (12 UTC) model outputs.  The CMC has
not been included since it deviated significantly from the
GFS/ECMWF general blend.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a
frontal system as it slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic this
week. This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East
for several days, with enhanced focus ahead of a closed upper low
late this week across the southern Appalachians and into the
interior Mid-Atlantic, where terrain enhancement will also be a
factor.  Models are trending toward drier conditions for interior
new England as a low pressure wave focuses precip near or just off
the Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts this weekend into early
next week.

A couple of developing waves will likely bring a period of
rainfall over the northern and central Plains by this weekend.  A
wavy cold front digging slowly but robustly across the West will
spread areas of rain gradually southeastward mid-later week and
the weekend, eventually working across the Rockies into the
north-central states.  Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, along with snow at higher elevations.  The
West should trend cooler with time as the upper trough approaches
and the cold front makes its way through the region.  Daytime
highs by later next week could be 5-15 degrees below normal for
some locations. Downstream upper ridging traversing the
north-central U.S. will support warmer than average temperatures
across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week with some plus
10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper 70s and 80s.
Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the emerging closed
upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the Southeast/East
should keep daytime temperatures near normal, but also maintain
decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for morning
lows.

...Areas of heavy rain and concerns for flash flooding are
expected over the Southeast going through the middle of the week...

...Elevated concerns for wildfire activity will exist over
portions of the northern Great Basin and the northern High Plains
going through at least Tuesday...

...Much above normal temperatures are expected over the northern
High Plains and Upper Midwest over the next few days...

A quasi-stationary front draped generally from areas of the
northern Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley southward down to the
central Gulf Coast region will remain largely intact going through
the middle of the week and move very little as the main belt of
the westerlies becomes displaced well to the north over areas of
central and eastern Canada. However, there will be a somewhat
cooler pool of high pressure over northern New England that will
nose southward over the next couple of days with the help of low
pressure developing along the front just south of Long Island
which will edge slowly eastward and offshore of southern New
England on Tuesday. This will allow the front to settle a little
farther south through areas of the Mid-Atlantic states over the
next couple of days. This wave of low pressure though will be
bringing a steady moderate to locally heavy rain to areas of
southern New England this evening and overnight, with the rain
tapering off Tuesday morning.

Farther down to the southwest, the aforementioned front will be
the focus for scattered to locally broken areas of showers and
thunderstorms which will cover a fairly broad area extending from
the middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys east through the
Mid-Atlantic and south down across the Tennessee Valley and the
Southeast. There is the expectation of seeing an upper-level low
develop toward the middle of the week over the lower Mississippi
Valley and this coupled with the front will maintain the threat of
unsettled weather. The heaviest rainfall is expected to generally
be over the Southeast, and gradually portions of the southern
Appalachians and Tennessee Valley, where locally several inches of
rain are expected to fall over the next few days. There will be at
least a localized threat of flash flooding and especially with the
expectation of seeing slow-moving showers and thunderstorms
capable of producing very heavy rainfall rates. In fact, the
Weather Prediction Center has depicted a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall for each of the next couple of days to address this
concern.

Meanwhile, much-needed moisture will stream into southern
California and the broader Southwest U.S. later tonight and
through Tuesday as some energy over the subtropical east Pacific
lifts northeast across Baja California and then inland into the
Southwest. Some locally heavy rains will be possible, and
especially over the Mogollon Rim area of central and northern
Arizona. An isolated concern for flash flooding will be possible
as well and mainly with respect to the burn scar areas.

Given the displacement of the westerlies well to the north over
central and eastern Canada, there will be a lack of cold fronts
settling south from Canada, and thus a large area of the U.S. will
see above to much above normal temperatures going through the
middle of the week. This will especially be the case for areas of
the northern High Plains and the Upper Midwest where daytime
temperatures may reach 20 to 25 degrees above normal over the next
few days, with some temperatures locally approaching 90 degrees
and possibly setting a couple of records. The very warm
temperatures coupled with dry conditions and gusty winds will also
result in concerns for elevated wildfire activity for portions of
the northern Great Basin and the northern High Plains. Much cooler
temperatures though will be lurking just to the west by Wednesday
as a rather strong Pacific cold front advances inland and crosses
through the Pacific Northwest.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A pesky upper low/trough will diminish over the east-central U.S.
Fri into the weekend along with a widespread wet pattern wrapping
from the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic back to the Great Lakes. The
south-central Appalachians may offer the most runoff risk as
enhanced by terrain and duration. Meanwhile, a split stream upper
trough and lead frontal system working from the West to the
north-central U.S. will offer an enhanced precipitation focus from
the Great Basin/Northern Rockies (including elevation snows) to
the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes with cyclogenesis.
Subsequent southern stream upper trough and surface system
translation out from the Southwest may then focus moderate
rainfall/convection from the south-central U.S. to the Midwest
early next week in response to robust upper trough/low
amplification and frontal digging back over an again unsetted and
cooled West. Maximum temperatures there may decrease in some areas
to 10-20F below normal to offer potential for some record values.
This development would also foster widespread precipitation
chances over the West to include enhanced mountain snows.
Downstream, a warming Plains upper ridge later week shifts over
the east-central U.S. next week. WPC web links listed below
provide more specific information on the surface/500mb pattern and
sensible weather/hazards.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The models seem to offer reasonably well clustered guidance
Fri/Sat considering flow complexity and a composite blend of the
latest GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian, the National Blend of Models
(NBM) and WPC continuity seems to offer a good forecast basis and
detail consistent with a mid-larger scale pattern with average to
above average predictability. The compatible 12 UTC GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means and the NBM may prove a more suitable blend days
5-7 (Sun-next Tue) considering model run to run variances with
embedded systems and weather specifics, but forecast spread at
these longer time frames may still equate to a pattern with
average to above average predictability.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0150 AM CDT Tue Oct 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
...Far eastern Idaho, across Montana, and into Northwest North
Dakota...

An amplifying mid-level shortwave trough can be observed on water
vapor imagery this morning in western Montana. As it moves northeast
this morning, the surface low is expected to move into southern
Canada with the surface pressure gradient strengthening across
Montana. This will lead to increasing surface winds this afternoon.
In addition, a dry airmass will be in place with very dry afternoon
relative humidity in the 8 to 15 percent range expected.

...Northeast California, northwest Nevada, and eastern Oregon...
A strong upper-level trough is approaching the Pacific Northwest
coast this morning. As it moves east through the day, a weak surface
cyclone is expected to develop in eastern Oregon. The surface
pressure gradient in the vicinity of this surface low, and deep
mixing bringing strong mid-level flow to the surface will combine
for strong winds from northeast California and northwest Nevada into
eastern Oregon. Relative humidity is also forecast to be in the
teens across this region.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN MONTANA AND THE
WESTERN DAKOTAS....

...Synopsis...
Lee cyclogenesis is forecast across Canada on Tuesday night with a
near 1000mb surface low expected by Wednesday afternoon. This will
act to tighten the pressure gradient across much of the northern
Plains. The greatest overlap of strong winds and dry relative
humidity is forecast across far eastern Montana and the western
Dakotas. Fuels in this region are near record dryness with ERC
values above the 99th percentile. Therefore, critical fire weather
conditions are expected in the western Dakotas and possibly far
eastern Montana.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast through Wednesday morning...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through
Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains; there is an Elevated Risk of
Fire Weather over the Northern High Plains into parts of the
Pacific Northwest...

A Developing upper-level low over Lower Mississippi Valley will
have a prolonged northwestward movement to the Middle Mississippi
Valley by Thursday.  The circulation around the upper-level low
will stream moisture northward over the Central Gulf Coast,
extending into roughly the Ohio Valley/Great Lakes by Wednesday
into Thursday.  The moisture will aid in producing showers and
thunderstorms over the Central Gulf Coast/Southeast into the Ohio
Valley/Mid-Atlantic, producing heavy rain through Thursday.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Wednesday
morning.

The Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall moves to the Southern
Appalachians/Tennessee Valley on Wednesday into Thursday morning.
In addition, a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall will continue
over parts of the Central Gulf Coast, also on Wednesday into
Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, moisture will stream into parts of Southern
California/Southwest through late tonight.  The moisture and
upper-level energy will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms
over the region that will push northward into parts of the Great
Basin and Southern/Central Rockies by Wednesday morning before
dissipating by Wednesday afternoon.

Furthermore, the smoke from wildfires will lead to poor air
quality over the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Air
Quality Alerts are in effect through Wednesday.  Additionally, an
upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the Rockies into the
Great Lakes as temperatures will become 10 to 25 degrees above
average over parts of the Northern/Central High Plains.  The
above-average temperatures, lowering relative humidity, and gusty
wind lead to an Elevated Risk of Fire Weather over the Northern
High Plains into parts of the Pacific Northwest.  Moreover, a
front will come onshore over the Pacific Northwest today, moving
to the Northern High Plains to the Great Basin by Thursday.  The
system will produce rain over parts of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California that will slowly taper off to a
small area over the Pacific Northwest by Thursday

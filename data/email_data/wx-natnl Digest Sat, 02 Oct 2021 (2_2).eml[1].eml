...Southeast/Southern Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Heavy Rain Threat
with a Blocky Closed Low...


...Overview...

Models and ensembles herald an amplification of the medium range
weather pattern next week. The flow should become more blocky as
an upper low closes off over the east-central U.S. while an upper
ridge/high builds over the northern tier states and southern
Canada. A leading wavy front and closed upper trough/low support
will spread rainfall of varying intensity and duration across the
eastern third of the country. Meanwhile an eastern Pacific upper
trough should steadily amplify and become more elongated through
the period, pushing a cold front into the Northwest and
California. A lead upper low initially offshore of California will
eject northeastward ahead of the upper trough and may produce some
areas of rainfall over the Southwest/Four Corners region/Rockies.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Guidance generally agrees on the overall pattern amplification,
but show varability with pesky embedded features. For the upper
low dropping from the Ohio Valley to the Southeast, placement
continues to vary some from run to run. Meanwhile, an amplifying
eastern Pacific upper trough nearing the West Coast and leading
closed low ejection from offshore CA offer reasonable larger scale
continuity, albeit with increasing forecast spread for how the
energy will be distributed and also overall timing of the trough
axis into late next week.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the reasonably compatible runs from the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models for Days 3-5 (Tue-Thu) and WPC continuity. This
composite has good ensemble support. Growing model forecast spread
suggest a quick transition toward the ECMWF ensemble mean days
6/7, with only limited input from the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian models.
ECMWF ensembles are more amplified than the GEFS/NAEFS and that
seems to better fit the overall increasingly blocky nature of the
flow. The latest 00 UTC guidance offers similar variances and more
detail differences, but a blend would remain in line.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Areas of rain and thunderstorms will accompany a wavy frontal
system that slows across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic next week,
with enhanced focus as a closed upper low works over the region.
This should keep rainfall over parts of the Southeast/East through
much of next week, with an uncertain but gradual focus from the
Southeast into the Mid-Atlantic. The guidance continues to signal
that some locations could see some significant local totals,
whether from an episode of heavy rain and/or a multi-day
accumulation due to persistence of the pattern. Guidance
variability and spread up to this point keep confidence in
specifics fairly low, but one area to monitor will be the Southern
Appalachians where terrain enhancement will be a factor.

A lead upper low ejecting northeastward into the West is expected
to generate a period of rainfall over parts of the Southwest, Four
Corners, and parts of the Rockies mainly around Tuesday-Wednesday.
A subsequent and wavy cold front digging slowly but robustly into
the West will spread areas of rain gradually southeastward with
time into mid-later next week. Most activity should be in the
light-moderate range, but a few pockets of heavier rain could be
possible along with snow in the higher elevations. The West Coast
will see moderately below normal daytime highs beginning around
midweek as the upper trough approaches and the cold front makes
its way through the region. Downstream upper ridging traversing
the north-central U.S. will support warmer than average
temperatures across the Northern Plains and vicinity next week
with some plus 10-20F anomalies that equate to highs in the upper
70s and 80s. Persistence of clouds and areas of rain with the
emerging closed upper low/trough and lead frontal system over the
Southeast/East should moderate daytime temperatures, but should
maintain decent coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies for
morning lows.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Lower/Middle Mississippi and the Tennessee Valleys through Sunday
morning...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through Monday...

A quasi-stationary front will extend from the Upper Midwest to the
Southern Plains, making noticeable eastward movement on Sunday
evening.  Moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will stream
northward over the Plains and Mississippi Valley into the Great
Lakes.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and near the
boundary, with some storms producing heavy rain over the
Mississippi Valley.  Therefore, WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower/Middle Mississippi and
the Tennessee Valleys. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable through Sunday morning.  The
threat of excessive rainfall will lessen slightly to a Marginal
Risk over parts of the Tennessee Valley on Sunday into Monday
morning.

Rain will move into the Northeast late Saturday afternoon,
continuing into Monday. As the front moves eastward, the showers
and thunderstorms will also extend from Great Lakes to the Central
Gulf Coast by Sunday afternoon.  On Monday, the showers and
thunderstorms will slowly expand into parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.

Meanwhile, smoke from wildfires will get trapped in the San
Joaquin Valley of California.  Therefore, Air Quality Alerts are
up over parts of the San Joaquin Valley through Monday.

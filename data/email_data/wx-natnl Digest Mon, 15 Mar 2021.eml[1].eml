Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1156 AM CDT Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TRANS-PECOS INTO FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...

No changes to the ongoing forecast. There is some uncertainty with
regard to RH falling to 15% or below in northern portions of the
critical area, models are also underforecasting the 30-50 mph winds
being observed in southeastern New Mexico. For the Mid-Atlantic,
overnight RH recovery was relatively poor with current observations
showing mid 20s to low 30s RH. With 15-20 mph winds ongoing,
elevated to locally critical conditions are expected are expected
this afternoon. Locally critical conditions would be favored from
the PA/MD border and southward where temperatures are already in the
mid/upper 50s F.

..Wendt.. 03/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CST Sun Mar 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low over southern Colorado will move eastward and
become vertically stacked as it slowly starts to fill through today.
A shortwave ridge across the Ohio valley will amplify while a deep
trough and 100 kt mid-level jet moves offshore across the Northeast.
Fire weather conditions will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and
southern High Plains this afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Westerly winds of 25-35 mph are expected south of the deep upper low
moving across Colorado and Kansas. Dry surface conditions with RH of
10-15% can be expected from the deep vertical mixing and
temperatures in the 60s. With fine fuel dryness above normal,
critical fire weather conditions are expected through the day.
Elevated fire weather conditions may also develop further east into
south central Texas where winds are slightly weaker, but dry
conditions persist.

...Northeast...
A dry post frontal airmass with RH as low as 25% will develop cross
the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon. High pressure over the Ohio valley
in conjunction with a northwesterly mid-level jet will drive
northwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph downslope and offshore
through the day. Despite the cooler temperatures, regional model
soundings show an environment favorable for elevated fire weather
potential through the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 PM EDT Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 17 2021 - 12Z Sun Mar 21 2021

...Heavy rainfall possible in the Southeast Wednesday...

19Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic model suite is in above average
model agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through the medium
range period.  For the closed low crossing the east-central U.S.
late in the week, the operational GFS is slightly faster than the
parallel GFS, with the latter closer in line with the model
consensus.  By next weekend, the ECMWF/CMC solutions are slightly
west with the upper ridge axis across the High Plains compared to
the GFS solutions.  The EC mean is likely not amplified enough
with the building trough over the western U.S. by the end of the
forecast period, and given the agreement among the deterministic
guidance here, a fair amount of the ECMWF/GFS/GFS parallel was
incorporated through the entire forecast with a slight increase of
the ensemble means by Sunday.  The previous discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging in the Bering Sea will promote troughing into the
Gulf of Alaska and northeastern Pacific Ocean, offshore Washington
state, later this week. An upper low in the Plains will move
eastward, carrying a surface cold front to the East Coast by late
Thursday, possibly producing areas of heavier rain. High pressure
will build in behind it from Canada with cooler and drier air. By
next weekend, the Pacific system will likely move ashore with mild
temperatures from the Rockies to the Upper Midwest.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Wed-Thu period as an area of low pressure lifts
out of the Plains and into the mid-Mississippi and Ohio River
valleys. The Canadian and GFS were on the slower and faster side
of the spread, respectively, and were gradually removed from the
blend. The 18Z parallel GFS (V16) was more aligned with the ECMWF
and ensemble consensus. By next weekend, some solutions showed a
lingering upper trough over the Southeast, perhaps spurring
cyclogenesis along the frontal boundary to varying degrees.
Depicted a rather meager area of low pressure that slowly nudges
eastward rather than wraps ups near the coast given the lead time
and dearth of near-shore ensemble members (especially in the GEFS
compared to the ECMWF EPS, which was stronger aloft over the
Southeast).

Over the West, ongoing preference toward the slower end of the
solutions (generally non-GFS) has served well but would still
allow a lead weaker front and then more defined front to come
ashore late Thu and early Sat, respectively. GEFS mean and ECMWF
ensemble mean were in good enough agreement to use as a blend
(with larger differences in the Southeast).

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will increase in areal coverage out of the
Plains/mid-Mississippi valley Wednesday into the Southeast along
the warm front. Locally heavier rain is possible along with some
thunderstorms from the ArkLaMiss into the Tennessee valley. Areas
north of the frontal boundary may see some light snow from the
Corn Belt into the higher terrain of the Northeast as the system
pushes offshore. Rainfall may turn to light snow as it ends over
the central Appalachians as colder air filters in from the
northwest. Assuming the front stays offshore next weekend, the
East will be largely precipitation-free.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Wednesday-Thursday, with higher amounts
possible from the system next weekend as the upper trough moves in
as well. Light snow could spread into the central and northern
Rockies as the front moves through the Great Basin and over the
Divide.

Mild temperatures over the Southeast Wednesday (widepsread 70s to
near 80 with record highs possible over Florida) will give way to
60s behind the cold front. Temperatures will be about 5 to 10
degrees colder than normal for areas in the East Fri-Sat. With
ridging expected to build out of the Rockies, well above normal
temperatures are expected for the High Plains next weekend
(perhaps 15-20 degrees above normal).

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 PM EDT Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 17 2021 - 12Z Sun Mar 21 2021

...Heavy rainfall possible in the Southeast Wednesday...

19Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic model suite is in above average
model agreement on the synoptic scale pattern through the medium
range period.  For the closed low crossing the east-central U.S.
late in the week, the operational GFS is slightly faster than the
parallel GFS, with the latter closer in line with the model
consensus.  By next weekend, the ECMWF/CMC solutions are slightly
west with the upper ridge axis across the High Plains compared to
the GFS solutions.  The EC mean is likely not amplified enough
with the building trough over the western U.S. by the end of the
forecast period, and given the agreement among the deterministic
guidance here, a fair amount of the ECMWF/GFS/GFS parallel was
incorporated through the entire forecast with a slight increase of
the ensemble means by Sunday.  The previous discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Upper ridging in the Bering Sea will promote troughing into the
Gulf of Alaska and northeastern Pacific Ocean, offshore Washington
state, later this week. An upper low in the Plains will move
eastward, carrying a surface cold front to the East Coast by late
Thursday, possibly producing areas of heavier rain. High pressure
will build in behind it from Canada with cooler and drier air. By
next weekend, the Pacific system will likely move ashore with mild
temperatures from the Rockies to the Upper Midwest.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Wed-Thu period as an area of low pressure lifts
out of the Plains and into the mid-Mississippi and Ohio River
valleys. The Canadian and GFS were on the slower and faster side
of the spread, respectively, and were gradually removed from the
blend. The 18Z parallel GFS (V16) was more aligned with the ECMWF
and ensemble consensus. By next weekend, some solutions showed a
lingering upper trough over the Southeast, perhaps spurring
cyclogenesis along the frontal boundary to varying degrees.
Depicted a rather meager area of low pressure that slowly nudges
eastward rather than wraps ups near the coast given the lead time
and dearth of near-shore ensemble members (especially in the GEFS
compared to the ECMWF EPS, which was stronger aloft over the
Southeast).

Over the West, ongoing preference toward the slower end of the
solutions (generally non-GFS) has served well but would still
allow a lead weaker front and then more defined front to come
ashore late Thu and early Sat, respectively. GEFS mean and ECMWF
ensemble mean were in good enough agreement to use as a blend
(with larger differences in the Southeast).

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will increase in areal coverage out of the
Plains/mid-Mississippi valley Wednesday into the Southeast along
the warm front. Locally heavier rain is possible along with some
thunderstorms from the ArkLaMiss into the Tennessee valley. Areas
north of the frontal boundary may see some light snow from the
Corn Belt into the higher terrain of the Northeast as the system
pushes offshore. Rainfall may turn to light snow as it ends over
the central Appalachians as colder air filters in from the
northwest. Assuming the front stays offshore next weekend, the
East will be largely precipitation-free.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Wednesday-Thursday, with higher amounts
possible from the system next weekend as the upper trough moves in
as well. Light snow could spread into the central and northern
Rockies as the front moves through the Great Basin and over the
Divide.

Mild temperatures over the Southeast Wednesday (widepsread 70s to
near 80 with record highs possible over Florida) will give way to
60s behind the cold front. Temperatures will be about 5 to 10
degrees colder than normal for areas in the East Fri-Sat. With
ridging expected to build out of the Rockies, well above normal
temperatures are expected for the High Plains next weekend
(perhaps 15-20 degrees above normal).

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 PM CDT Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 03/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Sun Mar 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
The deep upper low across the central plains will fill and lift
rapidly to the north ahead of a second strong shortwave trough
moving onshore across southern California. Shortwave ridging will
develop over the Southwest and Northeast temporarily minimizing wind
speeds across the areas of greatest fire weather potential.

...Southern New Mexico...
With the lack of  large scale atmospheric features across the
region, concentrated fire weather potential through Day2/Monday
appears low at this time. However, hi-res guidance has shown dry
surface conditions and near criteria wind developing in the late
afternoon. Thus, locally elevated conditions may develop through the
afternoon hours. Uncertainty remains high, but a small elevated area
may be added in future outlooks should more widespread conditions be
expected to develop.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun March 14 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Major winter storm to wind down over parts of the central
Rockies to the north-central High Plains tonight...

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain will shift towards the
mid-Mississippi Valley on Monday then Southeast and Mid-Atlantic
on Tuesday...

...Critical fire danger continues across parts of New Mexico and
western Texas...

A low pressure system continues to intensify as it expands its
impact with multiple forms of hazardous weather across the central
portion of the country.  Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico has been
lifted ahead of a dynamic cold front which continues to trigger
frequent bouts of severe thunderstorms across the southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley.  Farther north, heavy rain with
embedded thunderstorms are expanding across the central Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley ahead of a warm front associated with
the intensifying low pressure system.  Meanwhile, a major winter
storm is currently in progress across the central Rockies and
nearby High Plains on the back side of the storm system.  Heavy
snow and increasing winds are expected to wind down over much of
the central Rockies to the north-central High Plains tonight, with
additional light snow possible along the Front Range of Wyoming
and Colorado.  Blizzard Warnings, Winter Storm Advisories and
Warnings continue to be in effect from the central Rockies to the
north-central High Plains to the Black Hills of South Dakota.  The
storm should reach peak intensity soon as it begins to wobble
eastward into the central Plains on Monday, and weakens.  But in
the mean time, strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast to
shift eastward into the Mississippi Valley tonight before losing
intensity as it reaches the interior Southeast early on Tuesday.
As the weakening storm pulls eastward, there will likely be a
swath of freezing rain and mixed precipitation moving through
parts of the Midwest and Ohio Valley, reaching the central
Appalachians Tuesday morning.  In addition, dry and strong
downslope winds to the south of the storm are expected to promote
elevated to critical fire danger across parts of the southern High
Plains tonight.

Outside of the major storm system, some light wintry precipitation
is expected to wind down over interior New England tonight as
reinforcing shots of colder air move in from Canada.  Elsewhere,
much above normal temperatures are forecast for the Deep South and
Midwest ahead of the strong cold front.  Out West, an active cold
front from the eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round
of unsettled weather into much of the region through Monday.  The
Sierra Nevada should see heavy snow impacting the region tonight
into Monday, as rain spreads into the lower elevations of northern
and central California.  The system will then spread mountain snow
across the Great Basin and northern Arizona as well as the
northern Rockies Monday night when colder air settles from west to
east across the western U.S.  By early on Tuesday, much of the
Four-Corners region should see snow arriving while a low pressure
system begins to take shape in the vicinity. This low pressure
system will quickly organize into a mid-latitude cyclone as it
pulls another stream of Gulf moisture up and into the Deep South
Tuesday night, leading to increased instability and the chance for
thunderstorm activity. Snow will pickup on the backside of this
system over parts of the the Rockies and north/central High
Plains.

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 18 2021 - 12Z Mon Mar 22 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging initially over the northern Rockies and southern
Canada will translate eastward through the period, allowing a
closed low to linger over the Southeast. Troughing in the
northeastern Pacific will move ashore through the West this
weekend, setting up another round of snow for parts of the central
Rockies.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Thu-Fri period as an area of low pressure moves
through the Ohio River/Tennessee valleys and off the Carolina
coast. By next weekend, guidance continues to indicate lingering
troughing over the Southeast, supporting surface wave development
along the front just offshore. Upper pattern (Rex block) would
allow for such a feature but its proximity to the coast and
strength remain unclear. For now, kept most of its associated
precipitation just offshore but strong northeast flow aided by
high pressure to the north could pose some marine hazards (see
products from OPC and TAFB).

Over the West, upper trough is poised to move inland a bit quicker
than forecast 24 hrs ago (ECMWF EPS trended quicker towards the
faster GEFS mean) but a blended solution between the GFS/GEFS and
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean was a good starting point as the 12Z
Canadian was on the quicker side of the spread (possible outcome
but not preferred at this time). Split between northern and
southern portions of the trough could allow for a close low in the
Great Basin/Four Corners region by early next week.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will slip eastward to the Mid-Atlantic ahead of the warm
front on Thursday, perhaps with a bit of snow on the northern
fringe of the precipitation shield. Much of the region has seen
little to no precipitation the past 7-14 days. Rainfall may be
confined to coastal portions of the Southeast into Florida next
weekend as long as the offshore system stays far enough away. High
pressure over the Northeast will maintain cool temperatures this
weekend.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Thu-Sat until the upper trough axis
moves inland. Another system may bring in light rain/snow late Sun
into early Mon. Farther east, light to modest snow is likely for
the terrain in the Great Basin to the central Rockies as the
southern portion of the upper trough slows the system progression.
Question will be how much moisture can be tapped from the Gulf
early next week as the system pulls into the Plains.

Mild temperatures over Florida (record highs in the upper 80s to
near 90 are possible) will give way to 60s/70s behind the cold
front over the Southeast/Florida Friday into the weekend.
Temperatures will moderate in the northern tier by Sunday into
Monday to about 5-10 degrees above normal. Over the West, cooler
than normal temperatures behind the front  are forecast for much
of the region this weekend into Monday. East of the Rockies, well
above normal temperatures are expected for the High Plains into
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes (perhaps 15-20 degrees above
normal).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Mon Mar 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A progressive upper-air pattern punctuated by two dominate upper
lows across the Southwest and central US will continue through the
forecast period. A shortwave ridge between the lows will amplify
across eastern New Mexico and west Texas, decreasing wind speeds
through the day. A similar pattern is expected across the East Coast
as surface high pressure dominates the pattern temporarily. While
locally elevated conditions may occur across eastern New Mexico and
west Texas due to the warm/dry airmass, the lack of broader synoptic
forcing for critical criteria winds suggests minimal threat exists
for organized fire weather conditions through this evening. A
similar evolution is expected across the Mid-Atlantic where a dry
airmass with RH of 25-30% is expected. However, cool temperatures
and decreasing wind speeds through the day suggest little organized
threat. Locally elevated conditions may develop, but it appears that
highlights will be unnecessary given the brief/localized nature of
the threat.

0149 AM CDT Mon Mar 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low near the Four Corners will rapidly intensify and
eject eastward across the southern Rockies through Day2/Tuesday. At
the surface, lee cyclogenesis will take place across the Texas
Panhandle in the afternoon as a sub-1000 mb low is expected to
develop by 00z Day3/Wednesday. Critical fire weather conditions are
likely to the southwest of the developing lee low where strong
winds, warm temperatures, and low RH are forecast to overlap.

...Southern High Plains...
In response to the strong mid-level jet streak moving overhead and
rapid lee cyclogenesis, boundary-layer flow is forecast to increase
quickly through the morning hours. Peak winds during the afternoon
of 25-45 mph are expected within the warm/dry airmass across
southern New Mexico and west Texas. Widespread critical RH of 10 to
15% is expected through the afternoon. Widespread elevated and
critical fire weather conditions are expected to develop given ample
fine fuels.

Some questions remain on the eastward extent of the critical and
elevated conditions into west Texas. Warm temperatures are forecast,
but moistening return flow and weaker overall winds will likely
hamper more widespread fire weather potential. Nonetheless, locally
elevated/critical conditions may develop east of the current
delineated area through the day.

...Major winter storm winding down over the central Rockies to the
north-central High Plains...

...Another low pressure system is forecast to bring more severe
thunderstorms and heavy rain across the central Plains Tuesday and
Wednesday, with additional snowfall across the central Rockies...

...Critical fire danger continues across parts of New Mexico and
western Texas...

A large and energetic low pressure system enveloping the
mid-section of the country is showing signs of winding down after
delivering one to two feet of snow to the central High Plains with
higher amounts along the Front Range.  Blizzard conditions in
parts of the area have since subsided as the storm center slowly
makes its way eastward into the central Plains.  Nevertheless, a
band of moderate snow with some mixed precipitation is moving
across the Midwest and should reach the upper Midwest and lower
Michigan by tonight.  Some mixed precipitation should also move
into the central Appalachians tonight well ahead of the weakening
low pressure system.  Across the Deep South, expect some
thunderstorms to move into the region today and then lingers into
Tuesday ahead of a weakening cold front.  Rain and some embedded
thunderstorms should move through the Mid-Atlantic states on
Tuesday before clearing out Tuesday night as a new low pressure
center forms and moves offshore.

Meanwhile, the active weather pattern will appear to repeat itself
as another upper trough is forecast to move through the Southwest.
 This will bring another around of mountain snow and lower
elevation rain from west to east starting from California today
followed by the southern Great Basin and the Four-Corner region on
Tuesday.  By Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, it appears that
another low pressure will form across the southern Plains.

Dry and strong downslope winds south of the storm track will
continue to promote elevated to critical fire danger across parts
of the southern High Plains.

Outside of the major storm system, some light wintry precipitation
is expected to wind down over interior New England tonight as
reinforcing shots of colder air move in from Canada.  Elsewhere,
much above normal temperatures are forecast for the Deep South and
Midwest ahead of the strong cold front.  Out West, an active cold
front from the eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round
of unsettled weather into much of the region through Monday.  The
Sierra Nevada should see heavy snow impacting the region tonight
into Monday, as rain spreads into the lower elevations of northern
and central California.  The system will then spread mountain snow
across the Great Basin and northern Arizona as well as the
northern Rockies Monday night when colder air settles from west to
east across the western U.S.  By early on Tuesday, much of the
Four-Corners region should see snow arriving while a low pressure
system begins to take shape in the vicinity. This low pressure
system will quickly organize into a mid-latitude cyclone as it
pulls another stream of Gulf moisture up and into the Deep South
Tuesday night, leading to increased instability and the chance for
thunderstorm activity. Snow will pickup on the backside of this
system over parts of the the Rockies and north/central High
Plains.

the back side of the storm will once again support moderate to
possibly heavy snow spreading through the central to southern

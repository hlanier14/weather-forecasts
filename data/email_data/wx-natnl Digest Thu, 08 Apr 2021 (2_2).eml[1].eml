Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 AM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low will pivot into the Upper Midwest today. To the
west, a shortwave trough will dive southeastward into the eastern
Great Basin and central Rockies. A broad surface low in the upper
Mississippi Valley will tend to fill with time. With moderate flow
across the Divide, a lee trough will develop and merge with the
eastern low. A cold front will move through the Northwest and into
the Great Basin by the end of the period.

...Southeastern Great Basin and Southwest...
The synoptic pattern will favor dry and windy conditions across a
broad swath of the Great Basin and the Southwest. However, a very
diffuse surface pattern in the Plains and a general lack of
upper-level features will generally keep conditions within what is
typical for most locations. Fuels across parts of New Mexico and
Arizona are somewhat drier and elevated conditions are expected to
last longer. 10-15% RH will coincide with 15-20 mph winds during the
afternoon. Locally critical conditions area possible, but most
likely brief. Areas of southern Nevada into western Colorado will
see roughly similar conditions, at least in lower elevations.
However, shortwave ridging aloft will be in place during the morning
and afternoon. The surface gradient and mid-level winds will not
increase until later in the day, suggesting locally elevated to near
critical conditions will also be brief.

...Central High Plains...
Wind along the western flank of the surface cyclone may reach 15-20
mph. Locations in the High Plains will likely be at least moderately
dry with 15-25% RH possible during the afternoon. One mitigating
factor will be the decreasing pressure gradient through the day as
the Plains trough becomes broad and diffuse. Second, light to modest
rainfall has occurred in many locations over the last 24-36 hours.
Surface conditions in these locations Wednesday afternoon were not
overly dry even though windy. With overnight recovery already taking
place, it seems less probable that fine fuels will dry out early
enough Thursday for a significant fire weather threat. That being
said, locally elevated conditions are possible where fuels can dry
out by early afternoon. Southwest Kansas into east-central Colorado
would be the most likely areas for this to occur.

...Higher terrain of Santa Barbara/Ventura Counties...
15-25 mph winds are possible Thursday night into Friday morning with
RH in the 15-20% range. Dead fuels are quite dry in the midst of two
plus weeks of no precipitation. However, live-fuel moisture remains
relatively high. This, coupled with the threat being very limited in
space, precludes highlights. Only locally elevated conditions are
expected.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
258 AM EDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 11 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 15 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest guidance continues to show various significant
uncertainties with forecast specifics in a blocky pattern.  Upper
ridging over and east of eastern Canada with multiple closed lows
likely to meander to the southwest/south--between the northern
tier states and the Canadian Maritimes--will be a dominant theme
from the start of the period.  An eastern Pacific ridge that
builds into Canada ahead of an amplifying North Pacific trough
will add to the blockiness mid-late period, likely supporting some
degree of mean troughing over the western U.S. with a possible
embedded upper low.

As for the details, models have varied with what becomes of energy
within a leading compact Great Lakes upper low Sunday-Monday as
upstream energy (likely another closed low) approaches--ejecting
eastward or becoming incorporated into the flow around the
upstream feature.  For the upper low coming in from the northern
Plains, the past couple ECMWF runs have been weaker and more
elongated with the energy than most other guidance.  New 00Z
GFS/CMC/UKMET runs are still more consolidated with the upper low.
 The 12Z ECMWF uses some of its western elongated energy to
develop a deeper closed low a little west of consensus by day 7
Thursday though.  Also late in the period GFS runs become more
progressive than consensus with this upper low.  GEFS mean runs
have been holding the upper low back toward the Upper Great Lakes,
closer to the majority scenario, due to greater persistence of the
eastern Canada ridge.  Meanwhile solutions stray considerably with
time for the upper low initially near the Canadian Maritimes.
Similar behavior among ensemble members is likely playing a role
in the means becoming a lot weaker than most operational runs by
mid-period.  Preference would be for an intermediate solution with
the Maritimes low, keeping it a little east of New England.

Specifics over the West are still uncertain as well.  There is
reasonable consensus for mean troughing to develop from early in
the week onward but with a fair amount of spread for depth and
existence of a possible embedded upper low.  The GFS had been
mostly on its own for the deep and upper low scenario but recent
CMC runs have been trending in its direction and now the 00Z UKMET
shows a closed low for a time as well.  Through the 18Z cycle the
guidance spread was sufficient to favor holding close to
continuity via the ensemble means that have all been depicting an
open trough of more moderate depth.

Based on 12Z/18Z guidance comparisons and continuity, the updated
blend started with an operational model consensus early and then
transitioned to nearly all 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by days 6-7
Wednesday-Thursday due to various low-confidence aspects of
individual models.  The 12Z ECMWF was just close enough in
principle to maintain modest input late in the period.  Manual
editing improved definition of the Maritimes low at that time.
The new 00Z ECMWF has completely changed to the GFS cluster in
many respects over and near the lower 48, so depending on how the
00Z ECMWF/CMC means trend there could be a significant adjustment
in the most likely scenario.


...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

The leading system affecting the East on Sunday will produce areas
of rainfall over parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast while the
trailing front should support some moderate to heavy rain over
Florida.  The upstream system emerging from the West will spread
precipitation across the northern tier, with some snow possible
over extreme northern areas.  The combination of the second
frontal system as well as the leading one that stalls over the
northern Gulf/Gulf Coast region could produce some areas of
enhanced rain/thunderstorms from southern portions of the Plains
to the Lower Mississippi Valley/Gulf Coast.  Initially light and
scattered precipitation over the northern-central Rockies should
become somewhat heavier and more organized into the central
Rockies from Tuesday onward as upper troughing develops over the
West and high pressure building southward through the Plains
promotes upslope flow over some areas.  The best potential for
meaningful snow will be over the southern Wyoming into Colorado
Rockies and possibly east into portions of the High Plains.  With
greater uncertainty, some precipitation could extend farther
westward.

Expect portions of the Mid-Atlantic and eastern Great
Lakes/Northeast to see well above normal temperatures on Sunday,
especially for morning lows with plus 15-25F anomalies possibly
near daily record values if they hold for the calendar day.  The
Sunday frontal passage over the East will bring temperatures down
only to near or modestly above normal levels early next week.  A
cooler airmass will extend from the northern Rockies through much
of the Plains from Sunday into midweek behind another front.  Most
days should feature some areas with highs 10-20F below normal.
This cool air will continue into the Mississippi Valley and
portions of the East late in the period but in modified form,
yielding only single-digit negative anomalies.  Above normal
temperatures over the Southwest on Sunday should gradually trend
closer to normal as upper troughing develops over the Interior
West.  On the other hand an approaching Pacific ridge aloft may
raise northern California and Pacific Northwest highs up to 10-20F
above normal from Monday or Tuesday through Thursday.  There are
still enough uncertainties with specifics of flow aloft late in
the period to lower confidence in temperature specifics over the
West.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0206 AM CDT Thu Apr 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TRANS-PECOS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move from the central Rockies into
Oklahoma on Friday. An enhanced belt of mid-level winds will also
develop within the southern jet stream across the southwestern U.S.
border. The approaching trough will deepen a surface cyclone in the
southern High Plains. A cold front will move from the Texas
Panhandle into the South Plains by late afternoon.

...Southern High Plains Vicinity...
The presence of the surface low accompanied by moderate mid-level
winds aloft will lead to a relatively broad area elevated fire
weather in New Mexico and western Texas. One of the main challenges
will be the conditions behind the cold front. The typically cool
guidance shows RH increasing behind the front. However, forecast
soundings show clear skies and the strongest cold advection looks to
occur later in the day. With that in mind, the elevated area has
been expanded into the Texas Panhandle as the drier/warmer guidance
seems more reasonable in this case. Eastward extent becomes
questionable as increasing green-up in grasses is evident. Winds of
15-20 mph ahead of the front, and potentially up to 25 mph
immediately post frontal, are possible. RH will range from 5-15%
ahead of the front with 15-20% more likely after its passage.

Critical fire weather is most likely in the Trans-Pecos. This region
has ERCs approaching the 90th percentile along with stronger
mid-level winds associated with the southern jet stream. Here 20-25
mph winds will overlap similarly low RH of 5-10%.

Farther north into southeast Colorado, dry and windy conditions may
occur behind the front; however, there is considerably more
uncertainty as to if these conditions will develop and how long they
will last. No highlights will be added for this region.

...Northern Plains...
Very dry fuels are in place in parts of eastern Montana into western
North Dakota. 15-20 mph winds appear probable during Friday
afternoon. The primary issues here are marginal temperatures and
possible precipitation along the front Friday morning. These
uncertainties preclude highlights.

Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 08 2021 - 12Z Sat Apr 10 2021

...Heavy rain/flooding and severe thunderstorms are expected for
the south-central to southeastern U.S. Friday and Saturday...

...Snow is likely in the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains, with another round in the Northwest by Friday night...

...Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather remain in place for
the Southwest to Southern High Plains...

A surface low pressure system is forecast to continue to move
slowly to the northeast through the Upper Midwest over the next
couple of days, spreading rain and possibly thunderstorms to the
Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley, with some showers spreading
toward the Mid-Atlantic as well. However, the more impactful rain
and thunderstorms are likely to be farther south across the
southeastern quadrant of the U.S., as frontal systems meander in
the area and Gulf of Mexico moisture increases Friday and
Saturday. On Friday and Friday night, an Enhanced Risk of severe
weather is delineated by the Storm Prediction Center for the
Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley for tornado,
wind, and hail threats. During that timeframe, flash flooding is
also a possibility there, and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
is in place. Severe weather and flash flooding are again possible
on Saturday, with the threats shifted a bit eastward toward the
Southeast ahead of a cold front.

In the northwestern U.S., precipitation is forecast along with
cooler than normal temperatures as upper-level energy and frontal
systems continue moving eastward today. Snow totals of several
inches are expected for the Northern Rockies, with some snow
toward the Black Hills as well. Then, precipitation chances
increase again late Friday into Saturday for the Pacific Northwest
and Northern Rockies as another cold front comes through.

In the Southwest and High Plains, warm temperatures are forecast
along with gusty winds and low relative humidity values, and this
combination will lead to the potential for continued dangerous
fire weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center has outlined
an Elevated Risk of fire danger in and around New Mexico today,
with a Critical Risk in place for western Texas on Friday. Red
Flag Warnings are in effect for portions of the Four Corners
states and the Central High Plains as well.

In general, most of the contiguous U.S. should see above normal
temperatures over the next few days, with the exceptions being the
Northwest and northern/central portions of the High Plains, as
well as the Middle Mississippi Valley today underneath the upper
low. The Great Lakes region can expect high temperatures to be
around 15 to 25 degrees above normal again today, and a few daily
record highs could be set. The Desert Southwest and southern Texas
will experience temperatures in the 90s and nearing 100 degrees
over the next few days.

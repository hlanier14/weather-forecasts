Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1039 AM CDT Tue Sep 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Northern High Plains...
The forecast generally remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on recent observations and morning guidance. Surface
observations from eastern MT show lee troughing underway with MSLP
values already near or below the 10th percentile for this time of
year. This supports recent forecasts, which maintain reasonable
probabilities for critical conditions across eastern MT/WY and the
western Dakotas as the low deepens further this afternoon. The
eastern extent of critical and elevated conditions remains somewhat
uncertain due to the overlap of 20-25 mph boundary-layer winds with
weak moisture return across the central Dakotas. Brief elevated
conditions are likely behind the approaching cold front across
central MT, but will likely be limited in duration.

...Northern California...
An Elevated risk area is introduced for the Sacramento Valley where
winds have already increased to near 15 mph in some locations.
Recent hi-res guidance has come into better agreement regarding the
potential for RH reductions into the 15-20% range, which has
increased confidence in the areal coverage of elevated conditions.

..Moore.. 09/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Tue Sep 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Intermountain West will becoming increasingly
broad through the day as a secondary upper low over the southern
Plains moves northward and merges with the main trough across the
northern Rockies. As the primary mid-level jet associated with the
trough moves north into southern Alberta, a lee low/trough should
develop in response, across portions of eastern Montana/Wyoming. A
cold front trailing from the surface low is forecast to rapidly move
eastward across the Great Basin and Northern Rockies bringing cooler
temperatures and an increase in humidity. Gusty south/southwest
winds, and warm/dry conditions ahead of the front are expected to
support elevated to critical fire weather conditions through the
afternoon and evening.

...Northern Rockies and High Plains...
As synoptic lift from the trough and the rear quadrant of the
departing mid-level jet move across the northern Rockies, lee
cyclogenesis is expected early in the day across eastern Montana and
far western North Dakota. The increasing westerly flow aloft should
also aid in the development of a lee trough in eastern Wyoming and
the western Dakotas. The rapidly deepening low, below 1000 mb by
midday, will support strong mass response in the low levels, driving
20-25 mph southerly surface winds across much of eastern Wyoming,
and western South Dakota. Here, the warm temperatures and dry
downslope flow near the lee trough will support widespread diurnal
RH minimums of 10-20%. A lingering low-level jet may also bolster
surface gusts to 30+ mph through the afternoon given deep mixing
heights on regional model soundings. With very dry fuels in place
and ongoing drought conditions, fuels are highly receptive to starts
and fire spread. Widespread elevated to critical fire weather
conditions are expected through the afternoon and into the evening
hours. The approaching cold front will end the fire weather threat
after sunset as winds shift to the west northwest and RH begins to
increase.

...Central and southern California...
Gusty winds of 15-20 mph are expected in the post-frontal airmass
across much of the Central Valley and portions of southern
California this afternoon and evening. Low-level trajectories from
the west northwest will be less favorable for lower humidity given
the presence of a stronger marine layer farther inland. However, the
gusty winds and dry fuels may still support a few hours of locally
elevated fire weather conditions. The fire weather threat should
rapidly diminish overnight as RH recoveries near 50-60% are expected
to develop along with weaker winds.

FOR WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 06 - TUESDAY OCTOBER 12: Typhoon Mindulle, located ov=
er
the West Pacific, is forecast to recurve into the westerlies and its
extratropical low pressure system could affect the Aleutians and western
Mainland Alaska prior to week-2. Later during the outlook period, model
solutions generally depict surface lows of 980-hPa, or higher, resulting in=
 no
wind hazards. A 500-hPa trough is forecast to persist over the Bering Sea
throughout much of week-2, which favors near to above normal precipitation
across Alaska. Although the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts that 3-day
precipitation amounts (Oct 8-10) have more than a 20 percent chance of
exceeding of the 85th percentile in a relatively wet area such as the Kenai
Peninsula and Prince William Sound, a heavy precipitation hazard is not pos=
ted
due to the lack of good model consistency and agreement with the GEFS
reforecast tool.



Ensemble means depict a 500-hPa trough progressing eastward to the West Coa=
st
during week-2. Despite this mid-level trough and onshore surface flow, only
light to moderate precipitation is forecast for the western U.S. According =
to
the 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean, the largest 7-day total precipitation amounts a=
re
forecast to range from 0.5 to 0.75 inch, liquid equivalent, across the high=
er
elevations of the Rockies and coastal areas of northern California and Paci=
fic
Northwest. Since accumulating snowfall is expected to be limited to the
highest
elevations of the Rockies, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Cascades, a heavy
snowfall hazard is not posted. Although there is an elevated chance of high
winds across the western U.S. and high Plains given the predicted 500-hPa
troughing, large uncertainty on timing and the track of individual shortwav=
e
troughs preclude designation of any wind hazards.



Major Hurricane Sam is forecast to track north across the central Atlantic =
and
likely pass east of Bermuda. A pair of tropical waves, located over the
eastern
tropical Atlantic, are likely to become tropical cyclones (TCs) during the
next
three to five days. Model solutions are in good agreement that these TCs
either
track northward or weaken by week-2. A TC may also develop across the East
Pacific this week but the NHC has recently reduced chances for development.
During October, the most likely area for TC development shifts from the Mai=
n
Development Region of the Atlantic to the Caribbean Sea.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 PM CDT Tue Sep 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The forecast remains on track with low potential for robust fire
weather concerns. Localized elevated conditions may develop through
the Sacramento Valley Wednesday afternoon and within the southern CA
mountains late Wednesday night (as outlined in detail below).
However, the probabilities for widespread/sustained elevated
conditions appear low at this time.

..Moore.. 09/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Tue Sep 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad troughing will linger over much of the western US Wednesday,
supporting widespread shower and thunderstorm activity across the
central CONUS. To the east, high pressure will strengthen as
mid-level flow weakens and shifts to the north. At the surface,
gusty northerly winds through much of California will promote weak
to moderate offshore flow, along with warming and drying conditions.
Fire weather threats are expected to remain mostly local in nature,
though periodic elevated conditions are possible across portions of
southern California mainly late in the forecast period and into Day
3/Thursday.

...California...
In the wake of the cold front, gradient winds are forecast to remain
light and northerly through much of the day across central and
southern California. Warm and dry surface conditions are expected
with diurnal RH minimums near 20%. Poor RH recoveries should persist
into the overnight and early Day3/Thursday as east northeasterly
winds begin to increase in response to building high pressure across
the Great Basin. Weak offshore flow will likely develop across the
southern Coastal Ranges with some chance for locally elevated fire
weather conditions overnight.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of Texas late this week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will feature a slow-moving frontal
boundary across the Plains with a heavy rain threat most likely
over portions of Texas late this week.  This system should then
move more quickly to the northeast early next week as a closed
upper low exits the Northeast while the next upper trough from the
Pacific Northwest reaches the northern Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The main area of concern remains centered over the mid-section of
the country where models continue to indicate noticeable
differences regarding the eventual outcome of a stalled frontal
boundary in an amplified and blocky upper-level pattern across
North America.  The GFS continues to indicate a faster solution
with this system heading toward the Ohio Valley beginning later
this weekend.  Meanwhile, the slower ECMWF has been showing a
clear tendency of pushing this system faster toward the northeast
across the Plains for a past few runs.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF
solution calls for a low to drift southeastward across the Great
Lakes.  It appears that the model has not yet settled with a
preferred solution with this system.  A consensus approach was
used to handle this system.  A blend of the ensemble and
deterministic solutions from the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and the 00Z
CMC yielded a general southeastward drift of a low center from the
upper Great Lakes/upper Midwest this weekend, reaching the Ohio
Valley by early next week.

For the late week heavy rain threat across the southern Plains,
models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement for heavy
rain to occur through the western to central section of Texas
Friday and into the Saturday ahead of a stalled front.  Therefore,
a consensus approach was adopted to handle this system.  This
yielded a QPF axis oriented slightly more toward the northeast
across the southern Plains compared with WPC continuity.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread and potentially heavy rainfall should culminate on
Friday across portions of the southern Plains as an slow-moving
upper trough interacts with tropical moisture streaming up from
the Gulf of Mexico.  2 to 4 inches of rain with locally higher
amounts can be expected to extend through a good portion of Texas.
 Periods of rain can be expected farther north across the rest of
the Plains and the Midwest in the vicinity of the stalled front,
with a tendency for the rain to slowly shift eastward into the
Ohio Valley as the surface low pressure system stalls by early
next week. Meanwhile, a round of showers is possible for the
Northern Rockies/Plains on Friday as a front passes through,
scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible for southern
Florida through the period, and some moisture may return to the
Four Corners states by Monday/Tuesday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the end of the week, with
highs in the 70s through the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On
the other hand, cooler than average temperatures (especially
highs) are expected for the Rockies into southern/central portions
of the High Plains. Friday should be particularly cool over New
Mexico/Colorado/Texas given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast can expect temperatures a few degrees above
normal by the weekend, while slightly below average temperatures
are expected for the Northeast with the lingering upper low.

...Severe thunderstorms possible across portions of the
Mid-Atlantic today...

...Record breaking warmth and critical fire weather forecast
across the Northern Plains...

...Increasing chances for thunderstorms and heavy rain found
throughout the central and southern Plains through midweek...

The upper level jet pattern across the Lower 48 remains highly
amplified with strong ridging across the Upper Mississippi River
Valley; while a compact upper low exists across southeast
Canada/New England blocks and squeezes this ridge as the air
masses push off the Northern Pacific presses eastward.  In the
east, a cold front will continue to drop southward through the
Mid-Atlantic into the Carolinas.  Today, along and ahead of this
front, there is potential for strong thunderstorms with isolated
severe weather possible including large hail and damaging winds.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5)
of severe weather between northern Virginia and southern New
Jersey.  Behind the front, more fall-like temperatures will occur,
perhaps a tad cold over New England by Thursday when highs only
eek out the upper 50s/low 60s (about 5-10 degrees below normal).

At the peak of the upper-level ridge, ahead of the advancing
Pacific cold front, the Northern High Plains of Wyoming, Montana
and the Dakotas are likely to experience high winds and low
humidity in combination with very high temperatures supporting the
potential for Critical fire weather conditions and Red Flag
Warnings.  These extreme temperatures are likely to continue
breaking records with a large portion of the central to northern
High Plains being over 90 degrees, or about 20-30 degrees above
normal.  By Wednesday, the cold front will push into the Plains
and bring relief, but portions of Upper Mississippi Valley
stretching from Minnesota to Missouri/Illinois will remain in the
upper 80s to low 90s; about 15-25 degrees above normal.  The front
is expected to slow/stall across the northern Plains, and while
temperatures fall a bit further on Thursday, they will be still be
10-20 degrees above normal across the same areas.

The aforementioned cold front currently in the Rockies will press
eastward into the Central Plains but slow its eastward advancement
by mid-week; however, the colder maritime air mass will continue
to filter southward across the central then southern Rockies.  The
upper-level jet will also help to press drier air out of the
Mexican Plateau in advance of the cold front across the Southern
High Plains toward the Lower Mississippi Valley given
strengthening return of deeper Gulf moisture.  This will aid an
increased showers and thunderstorms across the southern Plains
with the main concern will be heavy rainfall rates and potential
for isolated to widely scattered instances of flash flooding.
While severe thunderstorms are not out of the question across
central Texas into W Oklahoma in proximity to the dry line and
eventually cold front by Thursday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 04 - 08 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
Gulf
of Alaska. Near to slightly above normal mid-level heights are forecast ove=
r
Alaska. A ridge is predicted over the western CONUS and Canada, while a sho=
rt
wave trough is predicted over the central CONUS. Above normal mid-level
heights
are forecast over the northern tier CONUS, while slightly below normal
mid-level heights are forecast over the Southeast and the Pacific Coast.

Below-normal temperature probabilities are elevated across parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle in association with m=
ore
cloudiness. Above-normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS and
the
Central and Northern Plains due to predicted above-normal med-level heights=
. A
predicted eastward progression of a short wave trough over the central CONU=
S
results in enhanced probabilities of near to below-normal temperatures over
parts of the Southern Rockies and Plains. Probabilities of above-normal
temperature favors over the eastern CONUS in ahead of the trouging..

Above-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over central and west=
ern
Mainland Alaska due to forecasted storm system development. Below-normal
precipitation probabilities are favored over eastern Mainland Alaska and th=
e
Alaska Panhandle in association with the above-normal mid-level heights.
Below-normal precipitation chances are increased over the northern tier of =
the
CONUS extending down to western of the Middle and Low Mississippi Valley du=
e
to
forecasted above-normal mid-level heights. The short wave trough forecast
progressing from the Pacific Coast eastward to the central CONUS supports a=
n
increased likelihood of near to above-normal precipitation for the
southwestern
CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains. Near to above-normal precipitation
probabilities are enhanced over central and southern portions of the easter=
n
CONUS in ahead of the trouging and consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 06 - 12 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Th=
e
Northern Pacific troughing is forecast to shift eastward over the western
CONUS
and a flattening ridge is forecast over the central and eastern CONUS.

Slightly above-normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over Alaska, favoring ne=
ar
to above-normal temperatures for Alaska except for the Alaska Panhandle, wh=
ere
below-normal temperatures are favored.  With the eastward progression of
troughing and potential cloudiness, probabilities of below-normal temperatu=
re
are likely favored over the Pacific Coast region. Near to above-normal
temperatures are favored across the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with
the
consolidation tool. The highest above-normal temperature probabilities are
forecast over the Upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes during t=
he
week 2 period.

Troughing over the Bering Sea increases the chances of above-normal
precipitation over much of Mainland Alaska and parts of the Aleutians.
Below-normal precipitation is likely favored over the Alaska Panhandle rela=
ted
to the above-normal mid-level heights. A short wave frontal boundary and
potential tropical moisture lead to enhanced probabilities of above-normal
precipitation across the West eastward to much of the Great Plains.
Above-normal precipitation is favored over parts of the southeastern CONUS,
related to moisture flow from the Atlantic. Below-normal precipitation is
likely across parts of the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Valley and
Northeast,
consistent with the operational auto blend tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

... Heavy rain threat over portions of Texas late this week...

...Overview...

The medium range period will feature a slow-moving frontal
boundary across the Plains with a heavy rain threat most likely
over portions of Texas late this week.  This system should then
move more quickly to the northeast early next week as a closed
upper low exits the Northeast while the next upper trough from the
Pacific Northwest reaches the northern Plains.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The main area of concern remains centered over the mid-section of
the country where models continue to indicate noticeable
differences regarding the eventual outcome of a stalled frontal
boundary in an amplified and blocky upper-level pattern across
North America.  The GFS continues to indicate a faster solution
with this system heading toward the Ohio Valley beginning later
this weekend.  Meanwhile, the slower ECMWF has been showing a
clear tendency of pushing this system faster toward the northeast
across the Plains for a past few runs.  The latest (12Z) ECMWF
solution calls for a low to drift southeastward across the Great
Lakes.  It appears that the model has not yet settled with a
preferred solution with this system.  A consensus approach was
used to handle this system.  A blend of the ensemble and
deterministic solutions from the 00Z ECMWF, 06Z GFS, and the 00Z
CMC yielded a general southeastward drift of a low center from the
upper Great Lakes/upper Midwest this weekend, reaching the Ohio
Valley by early next week.

For the late week heavy rain threat across the southern Plains,
models and ensembles are in relatively good agreement for heavy
rain to occur through the western to central section of Texas
Friday and into the Saturday ahead of a stalled front.  Therefore,
a consensus approach was adopted to handle this system.  This
yielded a QPF axis oriented slightly more toward the northeast
across the southern Plains compared with WPC continuity.


...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread and potentially heavy rainfall should culminate on
Friday across portions of the southern Plains as a slow-moving
upper trough interacts with tropical moisture streaming up from
the Gulf of Mexico.  2 to 4 inches of rain with locally higher
amounts can be expected through the west-central section of Texas.
 The threat of heavy rain should diminish quite a bit by Sunday
and into Monday as the main energy with this system is forecast to
lift northeastward toward the Ohio Valley, although model
uncertainty remains quite high at this point.  Thereafter, current
model trend calls for the system to push eastward with rain moving
into the Appalachians, parts of the East Coast and the Deep South
by next Tuesday.  Elsewhere, a round of showers is possible for
the northern Rockies/Plains on Friday as a front passes through.
Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms are possible for
southern Florida through the period.  Some moisture may return to
the southern Rockies by Monday/Tuesday.

Warmer than normal temperatures are forecast across the
north-central tier of the CONUS through the end of the week, with
highs in the 70s through the Midwest underneath upper ridging. On
the other hand, cooler than average temperatures (especially
highs) are expected for the Rockies into southern/central portions
of the High Plains. Friday should be particularly cool over New
Mexico/Colorado/Texas given the clouds and precipitation over the
region. The West Coast can expect temperatures a few degrees above
normal by the weekend, while slightly below average temperatures
are expected for the Northeast with the lingering upper low.

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Saturday with a deep upper low
still influencing the Northeast, with multiple shortwaves tracking
across the central U.S. Some semblance of a Rex block may develop
by later in the period as an upper high tracks across southern
Canada as low pressure in the mid/upper levels gets trapped to its
south over the Midwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance has been consistent for several model cycles
regarding an upper low centered over southeastern Canada over the
weekend with its core lifting out to the Northeast early next
week. Shortwave troughs across the southern/central High Plains,
the Northern Rockies, and the Northern Plains (Saturday positions)
have some differences, but along the line of what is expected for
small scale features in the medium range period. The main area of
concern from a model diagnostics standpoint remains the central
U.S. beginning early next week. The aforementioned shortwaves may
combine with energy splitting off and tracking westward from the
main upper low, which will likely develop troughing and
potentially a closed low generally over the Midwest. This is in
conjunction with an upper ridge building across the Great
Basin/Rockies through Monday and possibly forming a closed high as
it shifts eastward over south-central Canada Tuesday, blocking the
low from the northern stream. At the surface, model consensus
suggests a low pressure/frontal system could push southeastward
across the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley through the early part of
next week. While there are some model differences in the formation
and orientation of all these features, a consensus blend of the
12/18Z GFS, the 12Z ECMWF, and their ensemble means seemed like
the best approach for the WPC fronts/pressures forecast.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Moisture spreading into the central and eastern U.S. will continue
to cause generally moderate rain ahead of the cold front expected
to track from the Plains/Mississippi Valley over the weekend into
the Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and Eastern Seaboard by the early
part of the workweek. Rainfall totals could also be enhanced in
the vicinity of a stationary front extending east of the surface
low in the Ohio Valley. Additionally, some moisture may return to
the southern Rockies by Monday/Tuesday, while scattered showers
and thunderstorms are possible for southern Florida through the
period.

Warmer than average temperatures are forecast for the Midwest and
Ohio Valley especially in terms of lows, but even highs should be
around 10 degrees above normal on Saturday, though are likely to
moderate to near normal by Monday. The Northern Rockies/Northern
Plains can expect highs around 10 to 15 degrees above average for
the first half of next week underneath the upper high forming.
Meanwhile, temperatures a few degrees below normal are forecast
for the Four Corners states and into southern/central parts of the
Plains through the period.

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Rocky Mountains and central CONUS should continue
today as a mid-level ridge builds across the West Coast. As the
mid-level trough shifts to the east, northerly flow is expected to
increase across California and western Nevada. At the surface, high
pressure should settle across the Great Basin in response to
increasing heights aloft. The combination of the increasing
northerly flow aloft and strengthening low-level pressure gradients
should bolster easterly downslope winds across the Sierra, and
offshore flow across southern California. The dry gusty winds, and
warm surface conditions may support locally elevated fire weather
conditions across portions of the Sacramento Valley and southern
California coastal ranges through the day and into the overnight
hours. Given the lack of stronger upper-level support and only
modest surface pressure gradients, widespread winds greater than 15
mph are not expected outside of the higher terrain. As such, fire
weather concerns will remain primarily local in nature despite the
widespread warm and drying conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0142 AM CDT Wed Sep 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, split flow is forecast to develop as high
pressure continues to build over the West Coast, and broad troughing
lingers over the Rockies and central US. High pressure across the
Great Basin is forecast to strengthen somewhat while weak low
pressure develops across western Mexico. Gusty east/northeasterly
flow will continue across much of southern California bringing dry
and warm conditions to the region.

..Central and southern California...
In response to the increasingly high pressure across the Great
Basin, low-level pressure gradients will begin to increase early
Thursday across the Sacramento Valley and the southern coastal
ranges. Northerly mid-level flow along the backside of the weak
trough should aid in strengthening the increasing low-level winds
through vertical mixing much of the day and into the overnight. With
dry downslope trajectories, widespread surface RH below 15% is
expected through much of southern California and portions of the
Sacramento Valley. Surface winds of 15-20 mph and the very dry
airmass should support isolated areas of elevated fire weather
conditions through the afternoon and overnight period, with locally
critical conditions possible through the wind-prone areas of the
higher terrain. The highest forecast confidence currently exists
over the southern coastal ranges where stronger surface pressure
gradients are expected. However, the inland intrusion of a surface
marine layer may confine stronger fire weather conditions to the
higher terrain away from more moderating surface RH. Given the
current dry fuels and expected meteorological conditions, elevated
probabilities have been introduced for portions of southern
California.

...Heavy rain and the threat of isolated flash flooding found
across parts of the Central Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, and
Texas Gulf Coast today before the bulk of the activity shifts into
the Southern Plains on Thursday...

...Well above average temperatures continue across the Midwest as
cooler air infiltrates the western half of the country and
Northeast...

A majority of the active and potentially hazardous weather to end
the month of September will be found across the central and
south-central United States. A deep upper-level trough and
associated cold front are currently swinging across the Rockies,
with showers and high elevation light snow found in its wake.
Ahead of the cold front and throughout the central and southern
Plains, a warm and moist airmass in place will allow for numerous
clusters of showers and thunderstorms to develop over the next few
days. For today, most of the thunderstorm activity is expected to
form across the Central Plains as the cold front advances into the
region, as well as farther south along the western Gulf Coast and
Lower Mississippi Valley associated with rich moisture ushering in
from the western Gulf of Mexico. These storms over both regions
are likely to be relatively slow-moving, with flash flooding the
main concern. A Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall
has been issued through Thursday morning and includes the
aforementioned areas. A few severe thunderstorms capable of
damaging wind gusts and large hail are also not out of the
question from south-central Oklahoma to central Texas. By Thursday
the cold front is forecast to reach the southern High Plains and
clash with a tropical airmass in place across the region. This
will result in widespread thunderstorms and locally heavy
rainfall. Once again, flash flooding will be the main concern as
numerous clusters of thunderstorms chaotically interact and
potentially occur over similar locations. Thus, a Slight Risk
(level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued over parts of
central and West Texas, with a broad Marginal Risk extending into
the Central Plains and Southern Rockies.

At the apex of an upper-level ridge, warm temperatures around 20
to 25 degrees above average will be found across the Upper
Midwest. The warm and summer-like weather will also be found
across a majority of the Midwest today while only cooling slightly
on Thursday. Highs are forecast to reach the mid-to-upper 80s
here. Elsewhere, much cooler and below average temperatures will
be situated over the western U.S. behind a potent cold front. In
fact, Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are in effect this
morning across parts of Idaho, Oregon, and northern California.
The next storm system to impact the Northwest by early Thursday
will keep temperatures on the cool side as well, while also
dumping several inches of rain across the Olympic Peninsula and
northern Cascades. Meanwhile, scattered showers and cool
temperatures can be expected throughout the Northeast as an
upper-level low is set to meander over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1022 AM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

The Elevated risk area was extended to the east and south where
morning observations and ensemble guidance hint at increasing
probabilities for sustained elevated wind/RH conditions over
sufficiently dry fuels. Periodic critical conditions remain possible
across southeast MT. Recent surface observations from Canada show
the second cold front beginning to move southeastward towards the
international border. Most hi-res guidance suggest the front should
impact the Elevated risk area between 00-03Z this evening, bringing
a northerly wind shift and milder temperatures. Other details
outlined in the discussion below remain valid.

..Moore.. 08/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough over the northern US will lift to the northeast
as a second trough moves south out of Canada. As the two systems
merge, broad cyclonic flow will expand over the northern Plains and
upper Midwest through the day. At the surface, a cold front will
stall across the upper Mississippi Valley while a second stronger
front approaches from southern Canada.

...Montana and Wyoming into the western Dakotas...
In the wake of the stalled front across the Midwest, west to east
pressure gradients will persist across the northern and central
Rockies. Broad mid-level westerly flow will enhance westerly surface
winds to 15-20 mph through the afternoon. Downslope drying and
strong heating through the day should support widespread surface RH
below 25%. The combination of gusty winds and dry fuels will allow a
broad swath of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
to develop from southern Montana into the western Dakotas and
northern Wyoming.

Farther south, locally elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely over southern Wyoming. Displaced from the stronger flow
aloft, westerly winds of 15-20 mph will overlap with surface RH
below 20%. Enhancement from surrounding terrain may support some
stronger gusts through the afternoon. However, low fuel density and
wetter conditions in the areas of more receptive fuels will preclude
any additional delineations.

...Southern Nevada...
Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop with a surge of
moisture and weak upper level disturbance moving across the Desert
Southwest. Regional model soundings show PWAT values of 0.8 to 1.2
inches advancing northward across southern Nevada through the day.
While weak upper-level flow and the high PWAT airmass suggests
storms will be mostly wet, isolated lightning strikes may pose a
risk for a few ignitions or hold overs.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: The mid-level height pattern is predicted to be moderately amplified
over North America during week-2 with mid-level high pressure favored over the
East Pacific and Northeast, and mid-level low pressure more likely across the
western lower-48 states. A tropical disturbance currently over the eastern
Caribbean has the potential to track toward the southeastern U.S. by the
beginning of week-2, which may enhance rainfall across portions of the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic early in the period. However, there is considerable
model spread regarding the track of this system, keeping probabilities on the
lower side.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Mid-Atlantic, Appalachians,
and Southeast, Wed-Thu, Aug 18-19.

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, Wed-Tue, Aug 18-24.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY AUGUST 13 - TUESDAY AUGUST 17:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!oQ8iCzlIHL1uc3E4YHQGTMZOKT07M6aDfqRBtPV7Im19ptnqyAeplD_A_gc3ZbIl7lVJ_Acf$

FOR WEDNESDAY AUGUST 18 - TUESDAY AUGUST 24: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa height pattern over
North America, with greater amplification depicted in the ECMWF ensemble
compared to yesterday. Mid-level ridging is forecast over the eastern Pacific
with troughing downstream over the western CONUS. This favors some relief from
the heat over the West that is forecast during week-1. Additional mid-level
ridging is favored across the Northeast. Anomalously warm daytime temperatures
are predicted for the north-central CONUS, and extending through the Great
Lakes and into parts of the Northeast. Probabilities for maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile in the GEFS reforecast tool are notably high
(>60%) over portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley early in the period.
However, the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates these probabilities in the
20%-40%
range, with probabilities for maximum temperatures exceeding 90 deg F
remaining
under 20% over the Upper Mississippi Valley. Further to the west, where
probabilities are higher, it is more aligned with climatology. Caution is
given
to the GEFS given its persistent depiction of overly hot temperatures over the
region, with the relatively cooler ECMWF guidance preferred. Therefore, no
related temperature hazards are posted for the north-central CONUS. The ECMWF
depicts slightly warmer temperatures over New England relative to yesterday,
but only shows limited coverage of areas with a 20% chance maximum
temperatures
exceed 85 deg F, compared to the GEFS which has a more widespread area.
Additionally, surface high pressure forecast across the region favors a drier
air mass, working to keep heat indices below hazards criteria even if in some
areas temperatures reach well into the 80s deg F. The heat risk guidance does
not indicate any areas of the Northeast having at least a 20% of having heat
indices higher than 100 deg F, further precluding a related temperature
hazard.



Aforementioned troughing predicted over the western CONUS favors one or more
shortwave disturbances to eject out of the Rockies during week-2, which may
enhance rainfall across portions of the north-central CONUS. Uncalibrated
guidance from the ECMWF ensemble depicts at least a 20% chance for 3-day
rainfall totals to exceed 1 inch, with the corresponding reforecast tool
showing 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th climatological
percentile. While the GEFS is not as robust with this potential, the synoptic
set-up is similar to that of the ECMWF with the trough over the West, and both
the 6z and 12z deterministic GFS depict the potential for shortwaves to move
through the region. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy rain is highlighted over
the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley for all of week-2 to account
for uncertainty in the exact timing. This would be welcome rainfall across the
region, which is currently experiencing moderate to extreme drought
conditions.
However, too much heavy rain in a short period of time could result in
localized flash flooding.



Increased tropical activity is favored across the Atlantic Basin during the
next two weeks as a result of the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian
Oscillation (MJO). The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring
Potential Tropical Cyclone Six over the eastern Carribean, which has a 90%
chance for development into a tropical cyclone over the next 5-days. Models
generally agree on a track near or over the Greater Antilles, with increased
land interaction and wind shear keeping the system weak in the near term.
However, there could see some opportunity for strengthening as the system
moves
into the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. Track uncertainty increases afterwards, with
the deterministic ECMWF and its ensembles bringing a remnant low more north
toward the Mid-Atlantic compared to the GEFS, which keeps it mainly over the
Southeast. To account for both outcomes, a slight risk for heavy rain is
highlighted over portions of the Mid-Atlantic, Appalachians, and Southeast for
Aug 18-19. The uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble depicts at least a 20% chance
rainfall exceeds an inch over the period across much of the highlighted area.
Interests are advised to refer to the National Hurricane Center for the latest
information on this disturbance and any others that may also develop, and the
Weather Prediction Center for updated precipitation forecasts throughout the
week-1 period.



A zonal mid-level flow pattern is forecast across Alaska during week-2 due to
the placement of ridging over the Eastern Pacific. As a result, intermittent
surface low pressure systems are predicted to move across the state, generally
favoring below normal temperatures and near to above normal precipitation
across most of the state. Pre-defined hazards criteria are not expected to be
reached and the cool, wet pattern should help reduce fuels for wildfires.

...Major West/Northwest Heat Wave to Challenge Daily High
Temperature Records into the Weekend and also Late Week over the
East...

...Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Heavy Rain Threat from Florida
this weekend to the Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic early next
week...


...Pattern Overview...

Latest models and ensembles continue to show a strong upper level
ridge building over the Western U.S. while deep troughing lifts
from the Great Lakes into the Northeast through the weekend. The
strong ridge over the West will support another dangerous heat
wave with temperatures over some areas expected to reach or exceed
daily records for both highs and especially warm lows. By early
next week, the pattern may flip as amplified troughing enters the
West Coast and ridging builds over the East. Additionally, NHC
continues to monitor Potential Tropical Cyclone Six which may
approach Florida as a tropical storm this weekend bringing heavy
rainfall to Florida and parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic into early next week along the slower than average
track and as tropical moisture feeds inland well in advance into a
stalling lead frontal zone and southern/central Appalachian
topography.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains in decent agreement regarding Potential Tropical
Cyclone Six. Most guidance tracks the system near FL by this
weekend as it moves into the eastern Gulf of Mexico before lifting
inland into the Southeast early next week. Six offers a maritime
and inland heavy rainfall/runoff threat. Please refer NHC guidance
regarding the details and official forecast track of Potential
Tropical Cyclone Six.

Overall, The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived
from a blend of generally best clustered guidance from the latest
GFS/GEFS mean and ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models. Nudged blend weights from the models
increasingly toward the ensembles gradually over time consistent
with slowly growing forecast spread in a pattern with near average
predictability.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue
into Friday and Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-20+ above
normal likely to reach or exceed daily records both for high
temperatures and warm overnight lows. This heat wave should be
relatively short lived and less extreme compared to the all-time
record event in late June, but still of major significance for the
Portland-Seattle corridor. By early next week, temperatures should
rebound below normal across the Northwest as upper level troughing
enters the region.

Elsewhere, as the western upper ridge axis shifts east with advent
of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase and spread northward, again
bringing a localized flash flood risk. A cold front pushing
southeast from Great Lakes on Friday, should reach the East Coast
and Southeast this weekend. This will focus areas of showers and
thunderstorms over the eastern third to half of the lower 48
during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rain
are likely, but exact amounts and locations are still very
uncertain at this time and may take until the short range period
to resolve. Farther south, daily scattered storm chances will also
exist over the Deep South within a warm and moist environment.
Florida should see rainfall increase Friday into the weekend due
to Potential Tropical Cyclone Six (which may be a tropical storm
by then). Regardless of development, heavy rainfall across Florida
is likely, with tropical moisture tracking into the Southeast and
southern/central Appalachians early next week as tropical moisture
spreads inland well in advance of Six offering the potential for a
pre event.

Much above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic on Friday prior to the frontal passage, with hot
weather also extending into the Southern states. Combined heat and
humidity should support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many, on Friday, with the cold front likely to suppress
the heat to the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the
central and western Gulf this coming weekend. Across the Northern
and Central Plains, temperatures should be near or a few degrees
on either side of normal through much of the extended range
period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0216 PM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced to portions of the northern High
Plains where guidance has trended towards stronger winds. Sustained
winds near 20 mph appear likely and may gust as high as 30-35 mph
per recent forecast soundings. RH reductions into the 25-30% range
seem probable, and may fall as low as 20% for a few locations,
though confidence in the RH forecast remains low. Despite the
borderline RH forecast, the strong winds and dry fuel should still
maintain a fire weather concern.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Recent guidance has trended towards higher probabilities for
isolated thunderstorms across the central to southern Sierra
Wednesday afternoon. While storm motions will be slow (generally
less than 10 knots) and may allow for pockets of wetting rain,
thermodynamic profiles favorable for dry-lightning and very dry
fuels (per recent reports from local WFOs) warrant including a
dry-thunderstorm risk area.

..Moore.. 08/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow across the northern US will continue as weak
ridging builds across the southern half of the CONUS. Strong
northwesterly flow will develop behind a cold front moving south out
of Canada, while a surge of moisture across the Great Basin will
support thunderstorms and dry lightning potential

...Thunderstorms western Great Basin and Sierra...
Thunderstorm chances are expected to increase as the nose of a surge
of monsoon moisture lifts northward Day2/Wednesday. Model soundings
show PWAT values of 0.5 to 0.7 inches atop a well-mixed boundary
layer across portions of the western Great Basin and Sierra. Hi-res
model guidance differs on how far north the deeper moisture and
developing thunderstorms will reach, casting uncertainty on the
spatial distribution of any dry lightning threat. The greatest
potential for lightning will remain across the southern/central
Sierra where sufficient moisture and lift appear to be the most
correlated. Given the uncertainty, dry thunder probabilities will be
withheld until greater model agreement is reached.

...Eastern Montana and the western Dakotas...
Behind the southward moving cold front, a more humid and slightly
cooler airmass is expected to develop across much of the northern
Plains. Northwest surface winds of 20-25 mph will be bolstered by
the broad mid-level westerlies associated with the trough over the
northern US. Model guidance suggest surface RH values below 30% will
be likely in combination with the strong winds. This would favor
locally elevated fire weather conditions across much of Montana and
the western Dakotas where fuels are mostly dry. Should model
guidance trend drier, elevated highlights may be considered.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue August 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 16 - 20 2021

Model solutions are in very good agreement with respect to the 500-hPa height
pattern over North America during the 6-10 day period. A strong mid-level
ridge, predicted over the Northeast Pacific, leads to positive 500-hPa height
anomalies across the eastern Aleutians, parts of southern Alaska, and the
Alaska Panhandle. A trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted
further west over the western Aleutians. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are
predicted over the northern Alaska Mainland. The strong mid-level ridge over
the Northeast Pacific leads to positive 500-hPa height anomalies along the
Pacific coast of the CONUS. A trough is predicted over the interior West,
along
with near to below average 500-hPa heights. A strong ridge is predicted over
eastern Canada along with positive mid-level height anomalies across the
Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and Northeast. Negative mid-level height
anomalies across much of the Southern Tier from the Four Corners to parts of
the Southeast are associated with a mean frontal boundary and increased
convective activity. The GEFS, ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean solutions and
high-resolution operational runs are in agreement on stronger mean ridging
over
southeastern Canada relative to yesterdays model solutions. Additionally,
there is greater agreement in todays runs on a mean mid-level trough over the
western CONUS.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska, ahead of
a mid-level trough over the Bering Strait and under near to below average
500-hPa heights. Above-normal temperatures are favored for the Aleutians,
under
anomalous southerly flow. Above-normal temperatures are favored over parts of
Central California, along the eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific
mid-level ridge. Below-normal temperatures are likely for the Northwest, under
the predicted mid-level trough. Increased moisture advection and cloud cover
enhance odds for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest. Strong
positive 500-hPa height anomalies enhance odds for above-normal temperatures
from the Northern Plains across the Great Lakes and extending into the
Northeast. There is uncertainty between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
temperature
forecasts for the Southeast region, due to convective activity along a mean
frontal boundary and the potential for tropical activity during the 6-10 day
period. Near-normal temperatures are favored across much of the Southeast
region, along with increased above-normal temperature probabilities south of
the mean front in the Florida Peninsula, southern Louisiana, and southern
Texas.

Above-normal precipitation is favored for most of Mainland Alaska, ahead of a
mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea and increased onshore flow.
Below-normal precipitation is likely for the western Aleutians, and near-
normal
precipitation is favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, under increased influence from the Northeast Pacific ridge. A
predicted trough over the West increases probabilities of above-normal
precipitation for the interior West. Increased odds of above-normal
precipitation are also favored across the Southwest due to an active Southwest
Monsoon circulation early in the period; however, increased troughing across
the West is expected to shut down the wet phase of the Monsoon in the latter
half of the period. Strong positive mid-level height anomalies over eastern
Canada favor below-normal precipitation across the Great Lakes region and
Northeast. Over the Southeast and parts of the Central Mississippi Valley,
frontal boundary activity increases odds for above-normal precipitation. A
tropical system is predicted to move across the eastern Gulf Coast at the
start
of the 6-10 day period, leading to enhanced probabilities of above-normal
precipitation. Probabilities of above-normal exceed 50 percent in some areas,
although there is still significant uncertainty on the path and evolution of
this system for week 2.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
very good model agreement on the predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern over
the
CONUS, offset by differences among model temperature and precipitation
forecasts, and uncertainty associated with the potential for tropical activity
in the Southeast.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 18 - 24 2021

Models continue to be in good agreement on the predicted circulation pattern
over North America during the week 2 period, with some de-amplification of
large-scale anomalies relative to the 6-10 day period. The trough over the
Bering Sea and western Aleutians de-amplifies significantly during the week 2
period, while positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the
Aleutians, southwestern Mainland Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle, under
increased influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge, relative to the 6-10 day
period. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted northward of the
Brooks
Range in Alaska. Predicted mid-level troughing becomes more amplified over
California, relative to the 6-10 day period forecast, in the week 2 forecast.
Similar to the 6-10 day period, a strong mean mid-level ridge over
southeastern
Canada leads to positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending across the
Midwest,
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Near-normal mid-level heights over the Southern
Plains and Southeast are associated with increased convective activity along a
mean frontal boundary.

Increased onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of
northwestern Mainland Alaska, diminishing to near-normal to the south and
east.
The predicted trough over the West leads to likely near to below-normal
temperatures across most of the West. Enhanced probabilities for below-normal
temperatures in the Southwest are supported by increased soil moisture due to
the active southwest monsoon prior to the period. Enhanced probabilities of
above-normal temperatures are favored from the Northern and Central Plains
eastward to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, under positive mid-level height
anomalies. A slight increase in probabilities for above-normal temperatures is
indicated over the Southern Plains, as indicated by temperature tools.
Near-normal temperatures are predicted over most of the Southeast, with
convective activity along a mean frontal boundary, with increased above-normal
temperature probabilities south of the mean front in the Florida Peninsula,
southern Louisiana, and southern Texas.

Increased onshore flow over northern Mainland Alaska increases the chances of
above-normal precipitation. Below-normal precipitation is predicted for
southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, under the increased influence
of the Northeast Pacific ridge. Increased troughing over California reduces
monsoon precipitation leading to a forecast of near to below-normal
precipitation. Mid-level troughing over the western CONUS increases southerly
flow to the east, increasing chances of above-normal precipitation over parts
of the Northern Rockies as well as the Central and Northern Plains. A mean
frontal boundary and potential tropical activity lead to enhanced
probabilities
of above-normal precipitation across much of the Southeast. Below-normal
precipitation is more likely over parts of the Great Lakes and the Northeast
under positive mid-level height anomalies.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the circulation pattern over the forecast domain, offset by
increased uncertainty in the phase and amplitude of large-scale anomalies, and
some differences among the model temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Strong to severe thunderstorms possible into Wednesday across
parts of the upper Midwest to the lower Great Lakes...

...Heat intensifies across the Pacific Northwest while sultry
conditions persist across the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and the
mid-section of the country...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke continues in the western
and central U.S., monsoon showers and storms to drench parts of
the Southwest...

The upper Midwest into the lower Great Lakes will remain the prime
spot for more episodes of severe weather through tonight and later
on Wednesday as multiple upper-level disturbances attempt to
converge along a nearly stationary front in the vicinity.
Damaging winds, large hail, and tornadoes could accompany these
thunderstorms.  Meanwhile, scattered thunderstorms can be expected
from the Midwest to the interior sections of the East Coast
including New England, as well as along the Gulf Coast and into
Florida for the next couple of days, especially during the
afternoon into the evening.  Some of these thunderstorms may
contain heavy downpours that could result in localized flooding
issues.

Much of U.S. mainland will remain under the grip of abnormally hot
conditions through mid-week.  Heat Advisories and some excessive
heat warnings have been issued across much of the mid-section of
the country and into parts of the the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic.
Across the Pacific Northwest, the heat is expected to intensify
over the next few days as afternoon temperatures are forecast to
soar above the century mark toward 110 degree at some locations
across the interior section.  Daytime lows will be quite warm
along the West Coast and east of the Mississippi River where
numerous record warm minimum temperatures are possible on
Wednesday and Thursday mornings.  Looking further ahead, this heat
wave is expected to peak during the second half of the week.

Elsewhere, the evolving upper level pattern will favor wildfire
smoke from the western U.S. to advance downstream into the central
Plains and Midwest, resulting in reduced air quality through
today. Smoke refuses to let up from northern California to the
central Rockies and High Plains through mid-week.  Also, monsoon
showers and thunderstorms will be a daily occurrence in the Desert
Southwest while keeping the heat at bay.  In contrast,
temperatures in the northern Plains will remain below normal with
multiple passages of dry fronts over the next few days.

...Major West/Northwest Heat Wave to Challenge Daily High
Temperature Records into the Weekend and also Late Week over the
East...

...Potential Tropical Cyclone Six Heavy Rain Threat from Florida
this weekend to the Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic early next
week...


...Pattern Overview...

Latest models and ensembles continue to show a strong upper level
ridge building over the Western U.S. while deep troughing lifts
from the Great Lakes into the Northeast through the weekend. The
strong ridge over the West will support another dangerous heat
wave with temperatures over some areas expected to reach or exceed
daily records for both highs and especially warm lows. By early
next week, the pattern may flip as amplified troughing enters the
West Coast and ridging builds over the East. Additionally, NHC
continues to monitor Potential Tropical Cyclone Six which may
approach Florida as a tropical storm this weekend bringing heavy
rainfall to Florida and parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic into early next week along the slower than average
track and as tropical moisture feeds inland well in advance into a
stalling lead frontal zone and southern/central Appalachian
topography.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains in decent agreement regarding Potential Tropical
Cyclone Six. Most guidance tracks the system near FL by this
weekend as it moves into the eastern Gulf of Mexico before lifting
inland into the Southeast early next week. Six offers a maritime
and inland heavy rainfall/runoff threat. Please refer NHC guidance
regarding the details and official forecast track of Potential
Tropical Cyclone Six.

Overall, The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived
from a blend of generally best clustered guidance from the latest
GFS/GEFS mean and ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models. Nudged blend weights from the models
increasingly toward the ensembles gradually over time consistent
with slowly growing forecast spread in a pattern with near average
predictability.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue
into Friday and Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-20+ above
normal likely to reach or exceed daily records both for high
temperatures and warm overnight lows. This heat wave should be
relatively short lived and less extreme compared to the all-time
record event in late June, but still of major significance for the
Portland-Seattle corridor. By early next week, temperatures should
rebound below normal across the Northwest as upper level troughing
enters the region.

Elsewhere, as the western upper ridge axis shifts east with advent
of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase and spread northward, again
bringing a localized flash flood risk. A cold front pushing
southeast from Great Lakes on Friday, should reach the East Coast
and Southeast this weekend. This will focus areas of showers and
thunderstorms over the eastern third to half of the lower 48
during the period. Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rain
are likely, but exact amounts and locations are still very
uncertain at this time and may take until the short range period
to resolve. Farther south, daily scattered storm chances will also
exist over the Deep South within a warm and moist environment.
Florida should see rainfall increase Friday into the weekend due
to Potential Tropical Cyclone Six (which may be a tropical storm
by then). Regardless of development, heavy rainfall across Florida
is likely, with tropical moisture tracking into the Southeast and
southern/central Appalachians early next week as tropical moisture
spreads inland well in advance of Six offering the potential for a
pre event.

Much above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic on Friday prior to the frontal passage, with hot
weather also extending into the Southern states. Combined heat and
humidity should support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many, on Friday, with the cold front likely to suppress
the heat to the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the
central and western Gulf this coming weekend. Across the Northern
and Central Plains, temperatures should be near or a few degrees
on either side of normal through much of the extended range
period.

...Major West/Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high
temperature records through Saturday and weakening by Sunday...

...Tropical Storm Fred to bring a heavy rain threat from Florida
this weekend and the Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic early next
week...


...Pattern Overview...

Latest models and ensembles continue to show a strong upper level
ridge continuing over the Western U.S. on Saturday, with amplified
troughing moving into the region by Sunday and beyond which should
suppress the ongoing heat wave. Meanwhile, an upper level trough
will move through from the Great Lakes to the Northeast
Saturday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise again across much
of the East by later in the medium range period. Tropical Storm
Fred will likely affect Florida this weekend bringing heavy
rainfall, and then also into parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic early next week as tropical moisture feeds inland and
interacts with a stalled leading frontal zone.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Across the board, the guidance shows above average agreement
through much of the period both with respect to incoming troughing
across the West and the exiting trough in the Northeast. Out West,
the 12z CMC gets a little fast late period so it was excluded from
the blend. A total deterministic model blend worked well for days
3-4, but after that WPC prefers a blend of the more agreeable
ECMWF/GFS and the ensemble means which helps mitigate the typical
timing and detail differences of various smaller scale features.
The models have also come into better agreement regarding the
eventual track of Tropical Storm Fred. Most guidance tracks the
system north just off the western Florida coast and eventually
into the Southeast early next week. There remain some minor timing
uncertainties, which should work themselves out as it gets closer
in time. Please refer to NHC guidance for the latest details and
official forecast track of Fred.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue
into Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-20+ above normal
likely to reach or exceed daily records both for high temperatures
and warm overnight lows. Sunday temperatures should still be above
normal, but not nearly as extreme as previous days. By Monday,
troughing looks to quickly move into the region so temperatures
should actually rebound below normal across the Northwest. Some
portions of the Northern Rockies could be 10-15 degrees below
normal next Tuesday into Wednesday. Above to much above normal
temperatures will shift eastward Sunday and Monday into parts of
the Northern Plains as well.

Tropical Storm Fred should be impacting much of the Florida
peninsula by the start of the period on Saturday. Heavy rainfall
and gusty winds are likely through the weekend as Fred tracks very
near to the state. At this time, the heaviest rainfall looks to be
along the Gulf Coast of Florida Saturday and Sunday, but heavier
rain bands reaching the central and eastern parts of the state are
likely, especially if the storm were to track a little bit farther
east of its current projected path. Tropical moisture will also
spread into the Southeast and southern Mid-Atlantic early next
week, and well ahead of Fred. This moisture may interact with a
leading stalled frontal boundary and favorable Appalachian terrain
offering the potential for a pre event.

Elsewhere, as the western upper ridge axis shifts east with advent
of upper troughing over the Northwest, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase and spread northward, again
bringing a localized flash flood risk. A cold front should reach
the East Coast and Southeast this weekend focusing periods of
showers and thunderstorms with areas of locally moderate to heavy
rain likely. Exact amounts and locations remain somewhat uncertain
at this time and may take until the short range period to resolve.
Daily scattered storm chances will also exist back into the lower
Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains within a warm and moist
environment. In addition, combined heat and humidity should
support heat index values into at least the low 100s for many
across the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the central
and western Gulf this coming weekend.

...Major West/Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high
temperature records through Saturday and weakening by Sunday...

...Tropical Storm Fred to bring a heavy rain threat from Florida
this weekend and the Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic early next
week...


...Pattern Overview...

Latest models and ensembles continue to show a strong upper level
ridge continuing over the Western U.S. on Saturday, with amplified
troughing moving into the region by Sunday and beyond which should
suppress the ongoing heat wave. Meanwhile, an upper level trough
will move through from the Great Lakes to the Northeast
Saturday-Monday, with heights beginning to rise again across much
of the East by later in the medium range period. Tropical Storm
Fred will likely affect Florida this weekend bringing heavy
rainfall, and then also into parts of the Southeast and southern
Mid-Atlantic early next week as tropical moisture feeds inland and
interacts with a stalled leading frontal zone.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Across the board, the guidance shows above average agreement
through much of the period both with respect to incoming troughing
across the West and the exiting trough in the Northeast. Out West,
the 12z CMC gets a little fast late period so it was excluded from
the blend. A total deterministic model blend worked well for days
3-4, but after that WPC prefers a blend of the more agreeable
ECMWF/GFS and the ensemble means which helps mitigate the typical
timing and detail differences of various smaller scale features.
The models have also come into better agreement regarding the
eventual track of Tropical Storm Fred. Most guidance tracks the
system north just off the western Florida coast and eventually
into the Southeast early next week. There remain some minor timing
uncertainties, which should work themselves out as it gets closer
in time. Please refer to NHC guidance for the latest details and
official forecast track of Fred.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave that will focus across the Northwest will continue

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

...Synopsis...
Across much of the US, the mid-level flow pattern will remain quite
weak as broad cyclonic flow prevails across the northern CONUS. A
cold front over the Midwest will stall as high pressure builds to
the south. To the west, a transient mid-level low off the coast of
California will draw monsoonal moisture northward supporting
thunderstorms across the higher terrain.

...Northern Plains...
In a dry post frontal flow regime, breezy northwesterly winds of
15-25 mph are expected across much of Montana and the Dakotas
through Wednesday afternoon. Downslope trajectories will aid in
adiabatic warming supporting warm temperatures in the 80s and 90s F
despite the passage of the cold front. Surface humidity values will
be borderline for elevated highlights as additional surface moisture
behind the front is advected into the area. Diurnal minimum RH
values of 25-30% are expected. The combination of gusty winds dry
fuels and near criteria RH should support elevated fire weather
conditions.

...Sierra Dry thunder...
As the weak upper low meanders above the West Coast, monsoonal
moisture will be drawn northward across Nevada and southern
California. Isolated thunderstorms are forecast to develop across
the higher terrain by early afternoon. Steep low-level lapse rates
and dry surface conditions will increase potential for a few dry
lightning strikes. Given current fuel receptiveness, isolated dry
thunder probabilities will be maintained.

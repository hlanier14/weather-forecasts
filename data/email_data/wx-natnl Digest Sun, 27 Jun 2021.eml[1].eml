Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1128 AM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

The isolated dry thunderstorm area across the Four Corners was
expanded slightly westward to account for the latest guidance
consensus. Locally Elevated surface winds/RH are also expected over
terrain-favoring locations across much of the Interior West given
potentially record-high temperatures and deep boundary-layer mixing.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 06/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level blocking pattern will continue to take hold across the
western United States on Saturday, bringing hot and dry conditions
to much of the area, including potentially record temperatures to
portions of the Pacific Northwest. This block will be anchored by a
strong mid-level anticyclone centered over Vancouver Island, Canada.
Beneath this anticyclone, hot/dry conditions and steep low-level
lapse rates will support plume-dominated fire conditions across much
of the West.

Farther east, downstream of the ridge, mid-level troughing will
support seasonably cool and wet conditions across much of the
central United States, limiting the overall critical fire weather
potential.

... Four Corners Area ...

The potential exists for isolated dry thunderstorms to develop
across the region as strong diurnal heating and modest mid-level
moisture combine with favored terrain areas to support convective
initiation. Meager low-level moisture and strong sub-cloud layer
mixing will result in high-based thunderstorms that will struggle to
produce wetting rains.

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest...
...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to the Midwest and later into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valley...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement that a
highly anomalous upper ridge will remain parked over much of the
West through next week. The ridge may slowly shift eastward with
time (though still maintain impressive strength) in response to a
compact upper low lifting along the Pacific Northwest coast and
eventually pushing into British Columbia as an open wave. Models
show some minor timing/strength variability with this feature,
though a general blend should help to mitigate those differences.

Across the northern tier states, a positively-tilted trough will
likely drift very slowly eastward with increasing model agreement
for a closed center to form over the Great Lakes toward the end of
next week. The ECMWF/GFS have been most consistent in showing this
feature drifting southward into the Midwest, with some timing
differences later in the period. The 00z CMC however drags this
low more westerly into the Northern Plains, which is inconsistent
with the rest of the guidance. Meanwhile, a broad and persistent
southerly flow will direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico northward through the Deep South and interact with a
slow-moving frontal boundary across the mid-section of the
country. Downstream, this leads to an anomalously strong
subtropical ridge off the East Coast to extend northward into the
Canadian Maritimes. A heat wave is forecast for much of New
England into the Mid-Atlantic into the middle of next week before
cooler air associated with the upper trough filters into the
region later next week.

The WPC forecast used a blend of the deterministic models (with
more emphasis towards the 00z ECMWF/06z GFS) for days 3-4. Removed
the CMC thereafter in favor of increasing contribution from the
ensemble means to help smooth out some of the less predictable
detail differences. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous WPC forecast as well and only minor changes were
needed to the surface progs.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region. Temperatures will
soar 20 to locally more than 30 degrees above normal from
Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies. Numerous
daily and monthly high temperature records -- including for the
states of WA, OR, and ID -- are likely to be tied or broken from
the Pacific Northwest and interior California to the north/central
Great Basin and northern Rockies, where temperatures peaking
between 100F and the upper 110sF are forecast for the lower
elevations. All-time record highs are probable across portions of
OR and WA. Little rainfall is expected to ease this excessive heat
in a pattern with growing drought and fire threats and minimal
recovery overnight will also increase the heat stress. Conditions
may improve slightly for the Pacific Northwest later in the week
as upper troughing pushes into southwest Canada, but excessive
heat will continue across interior portions of the Northwest into
next weekend.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Drought
conditions across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes in particular
should ease if not be outright eliminated over the next week.
Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely across some of
these areas with overall progression slowed by the blocky synoptic
pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a strong
western Atlantic ridge to the east. Heavy rainfall axis may drop
slowly southward later next week as an upper low potentially
organizes over the Midwest states.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
persist into mid-week from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts. The hottest days/most anomalous
readings will be across New England from days 3-4/Tuesday and
Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and rain
increases in coverage and intensity. Last but not least, tropical
moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into FL/the
Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel convection
and some gusty winds early next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
140 PM EDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 29 2021 - 12Z Sat Jul 03 2021

...Historic and Dangerous Heat Wave with monthly/all-time record
temperatures probable over the Northwest...
...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...
...Persistent Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern
Rockies/Plains to the Midwest and later into the Ohio/Tennessee
Valley...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles continue to show very good agreement that a
highly anomalous upper ridge will remain parked over much of the
West through next week. The ridge may slowly shift eastward with
time (though still maintain impressive strength) in response to a
compact upper low lifting along the Pacific Northwest coast and
eventually pushing into British Columbia as an open wave. Models
show some minor timing/strength variability with this feature,
though a general blend should help to mitigate those differences.

Across the northern tier states, a positively-tilted trough will
likely drift very slowly eastward with increasing model agreement
for a closed center to form over the Great Lakes toward the end of
next week. The ECMWF/GFS have been most consistent in showing this
feature drifting southward into the Midwest, with some timing
differences later in the period. The 00z CMC however drags this
low more westerly into the Northern Plains, which is inconsistent
with the rest of the guidance. Meanwhile, a broad and persistent
southerly flow will direct tropical moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico northward through the Deep South and interact with a
slow-moving frontal boundary across the mid-section of the
country. Downstream, this leads to an anomalously strong
subtropical ridge off the East Coast to extend northward into the
Canadian Maritimes. A heat wave is forecast for much of New
England into the Mid-Atlantic into the middle of next week before
cooler air associated with the upper trough filters into the
region later next week.

The WPC forecast used a blend of the deterministic models (with
more emphasis towards the 00z ECMWF/06z GFS) for days 3-4. Removed
the CMC thereafter in favor of increasing contribution from the
ensemble means to help smooth out some of the less predictable
detail differences. This maintained fairly good continuity with
the previous WPC forecast as well and only minor changes were
needed to the surface progs.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region. Temperatures will
soar 20 to locally more than 30 degrees above normal from
Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies. Numerous
daily and monthly high temperature records -- including for the
states of WA, OR, and ID -- are likely to be tied or broken from
the Pacific Northwest and interior California to the north/central
Great Basin and northern Rockies, where temperatures peaking
between 100F and the upper 110sF are forecast for the lower
elevations. All-time record highs are probable across portions of
OR and WA. Little rainfall is expected to ease this excessive heat
in a pattern with growing drought and fire threats and minimal
recovery overnight will also increase the heat stress. Conditions
may improve slightly for the Pacific Northwest later in the week
as upper troughing pushes into southwest Canada, but excessive
heat will continue across interior portions of the Northwest into
next weekend.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Drought

should ease if not be outright eliminated over the next week.

these areas with overall progression slowed by the blocky synoptic

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat June 26 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude

...A Historic Unprecedented Heat Wave will grip the Northwest into
next week...

...Heavy Rains, Flash Flooding and Severe Thunderstorms possible
from the Southern High Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley and
Mid West...

...Much above average temperatures expected to develop across the
northeast quarter of the nation Sunday, continuing into next
week...

An anomalously strong mid to upper level ridge will move little
over the next two days and remain along British
Columbia/Washington State border area.  This will be the driver
for a historic and unprecedented heat wave that will grip the
Northwest for the remainder of this weekend and continue well into
the upcoming week.  Numerous record high temperatures and record
high minimum temperatures are likely to be set over the next
several days across the Northwest from northern
California/northwest Nevada, across much of Oregon and Washington
State.  The expected record high temperatures will not only be for
the day, but also for the month of June and all time.  All time
record high temperatures likely to be broken over the next few
days in Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon with forecast
temperatures of 110 degrees in Portland on Sunday, breaking the
all time high of 107 degrees ,and a forecast high of 107 degrees
in Seattle on Monday breaking the all time high of 105 degrees.
Much of this area will see high temperatures 30 to 35 degrees
hotter than average and morning low temperatures  20 to 25 degrees
warmer than average over the next several days.   In many
locations, the morning lows will be greater than the average high
temperatures illustrating the anomalous nature of this historic
heatwave.   Excessive Heat Warnings are currently in effect across
Washington State, Oregon, much of Idaho and portions of
California/western Nevada and will likely remain in place going
into this week.

While the Northwest remains stuck in a very hot and dry pattern,
the opposite will be true across portions of the mid section of
the nation from the Southern High Plains into the Mid Mississippi
Valley and Mid West.  The upstream anomalous closed high over the
Northwest will also support a persistent upper level trof across
these areas and nearly stationary frontal boundary stretching in a
southwest to northeasterly direction across these areas.  This
will support the potential for widespread heavy rains, localized
flash flooding and severe thunderstorms in the vicinity of this
stationary front Sunday and Monday.   Across the Central to
Southern High Plains, high temperatures are expected to be 20 to
25 degrees colder than average from southeast Wyoming, through
Colorado, New Mexico, western Texas, far western Kansas and
western Nebraska.

While paling in comparison to the record northwestern heat, hot
temperatures are also expected to develop Sunday from the Ohio
Valley, into the Mid-Atlantic and New England.  High temperatures
are expected to be 10 to 15 degrees above average by Monday with
these temperatures approaching record highs in places from
southern New England into the coastal Mid-Atlantic.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

An Elevated area was added across portions of the Four Corners.
Surface high pressure across the northern Rockies, along with a
thermally-driven surface low across the Southwest, is expected to
support a pressure gradient, with northerly surface flow overspread
by modest mid-level northerly winds. As such, and as depicted by the
latest guidance consensus, 15-20 mph sustained north-northeasterly
surface winds are expected amidst surface RH below 20% for several
hours, warranting the addition of Elevated highlights.

Elevated highlights across the Pacific Northwest were also expanded
along the lee of the Cascades, with the isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation across the Four Corners expanded westward to account for
the latest guidance. Otherwise, the previous forecast for the
Pacific Northwest and Four Corners remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 06/26/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sat Jun 26 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level high will slowly move east into western Canada on
Sunday, with the associated ridge axis progressing farther east into
the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, a seasonably strong mid-level
low will begin to move northward along the western periphery of the
aforementioned ridge. The net result of this interaction will be
sustained easterly flow across much of the lower troposphere.

Farther east, continued troughing across the central United States
should result in seasonably cool and wet conditions and limited
critical fire weather potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

As the aforementioned mid-level ridge moves east and the mid-level
trough approaches, a surface trough will develop along the immediate
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest. This will result in an
increasing surface-pressure gradient and a corresponding increase in
surface wind speeds. This increase in surface winds will coincide
with extremely hot temperatures -- potentially record setting in
some areas -- and a very dry boundary layer to support elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions. Additionally, given the
unstable lower troposphere across the region, conditions will
support plume-dominated fire concerns as well.

... Eastern Arizona northward into the Four Corners area ...

Strong diurnal heating may result in a few thunderstorms across the
area, with chances increasing to the east. Although mid-level
moisture is expected to be slightly greater on Sunday as compared to
Saturday, increasing 700-500 millibar northerly flow may allow for
storm speeds to be greater than on Saturday. The combination of
potentially faster storm speeds and a continued dry/well-mixed
sub-cloud layer will maintain support for isolated dry
thunderstorms.

This area will likely need to be adjusted in subsequent forecasts as
confidence in the location and speed of thunderstorm activity
increases.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0200 AM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will remain centered across
southwest Canada on Sunday, as a seasonably strong mid-level trough
moves northward along the West Coast and western periphery of the
anticyclone. The resulting juxtaposition of these two features will
maintain easterly to southeasterly mid-level flow across much of the
Pacific Northwest. The exception to this will be across portions of
Idaho, where an increasing mid-level height gradient between the
strong mid-level anticyclone and a downstream trough will support a
belt of enhanced northerly mid-level flow. This northerly mid-level
flow will extend all the way southward into Arizona.

The mid-level anticyclone will provide support for maintaining a
surface anticyclone across much of the Intermountain West. Farther
west, a south-to-north oriented trough will strengthen during the
day, resulting in an increasing pressure gradient that will favor
gusty easterly low-level flow.

Across the central and eastern United States, broad troughing, rich
tropical moisture, or both will maintain a wet pattern and limited
fire potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

Elevated fire weather conditions will develop during the day on
Sunday as gusty easterly flow of 15 to 20 mph occurs in response to
the aforementioned increased surface-pressure gradient. This
pronounced easterly low-level flow will occur in conjunction with
widespread temperatures over 100 F and numerous areas warming to
greater than 110 F. This alone will result in elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions. However, a very deep mixing layer
will envelop much of the area, resulting in a turbulent and unstable
lower troposphere. These meteorological conditions will also support
plume-dominated fire behavior potential.

... Northeast Arizona and the Four Corners Region ...

Increasing mid-level moisture will support isolated thunderstorms
across northeast Arizona and southeast Utah, particularly across
terrain favored areas. However, strong diurnal heating will support
the development of a well-mixed boundary layer by late morning and
early afternoon across the region. This dry sub-cloud layer will
make it difficult to achieve wetting rains with afternoon
thunderstorms. Additionally, increased northerly flow in the
cloud-bearing layer should allow thunderstorms to move off the
terrain, decreasing the likelihood that precipitation cores will be
able to completely overcome the dry low levels at any one location.
Additionally, given the belt of enhanced northerly flow in the
presence of strong diurnal mixing, surface winds may gust as high as
20 mph resulting in elevated fire weather conditions.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest is forecast to continue
into the 4th of July weekend while becoming less intense...

...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...

...Heavy rain threat from southern Rockies/Plains to the Midwest
midweek should shift south to near the Gulf Coast by the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show that the highly anomalous upper ridge
across the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia will lose some
strength by midweek as a compact upper low lifts northward just
off the Pacific Northwest coast and weaken into an open wave.
There is good model agreement that the ridge will expand slowly
eastward into the northern High Plains through the latter half of
the week ahead of a positively-tilted trough initially over the
northern Plains.  There continues to be increasing model signals
for the upper trough to develop into a closed low over the Great
Lakes later this week although the ensemble means tend to retain
the positively-tilted configuration.  Meanwhile, a slow-moving
frontal boundary across the mid-section of the country should
begin to push slowly southward amid increasing model signals for
the upper trough/low over the Great Lakes to dip further south.
This pattern should  bring the heavy rain threat progressively
southward from the mid-South to the Gulf Coast while directing
moisture toward much of the East Coast for the 4th of July weekend
following the early/mid-week heat wave across New England and the
Mid-Atlantic.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean, 12Z ECMWF/ECENS means and some
contributions from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean in an overall pattern with
above average predictability days 3-5 (Wednesday-Friday), followed
by shifting blend focus toward the still compatible ensemble means
by the 4th of July weekend amid gradually increasing forecast
spread.  This maintained fairly good continuity with the previous
WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region.  As the ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly, the heat should become much less
intense by Wednesday near the Pacific Northwest coast but high
temperatures across the interior sections will remain 20 to nearly
30 degrees above normal through late week with some improvement
possible by the 4th of July weekend. Little rainfall is expected
to ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and
fire threats and minimal recovery overnight will also increase the
heat stress. Conditions may improve slightly for the Pacific
Northwest later in the week as upper troughing pushes into
southwest Canada, but excessive heat will continue across interior
portions of the Northwest into next weekend.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period. Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Drought
conditions across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes in particular
should ease if not be outright eliminated over the next week.
Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely across some of
these areas with overall progression slowed by the blocky synoptic
pattern sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a strong
western Atlantic ridge to the east. Heavy rainfall axis may drop
slowly southward later next week as an upper low potentially
organizes over the Midwest states.

Under the northward displaced Bermuda High, a heat wave appears to
persist into mid-week from the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic where
afternoon temperatures are forecast to peak well into the 90s away
from the immediate coasts. The hottest days/most anomalous
readings will be across New England from days 3-4/Tuesday and
Wednesday next week before a front slips southward and rain
increases in coverage and intensity. Last but not least, tropical
moisture/disturbances should move from the Atlantic into FL/the
Southeast underneath the displaced Bermuda High to fuel convection
and some gusty winds early next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CDT Sun Jun 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A very strong mid-level anticyclone will remain centered across
southwest Canada on Monday, as a seasonably strong mid-level trough
moves northward along the Oregon Coast. This will maintain easterly
to southeasterly mid-level flow across much of the Pacific
Northwest, including areas farther east that had northerly flow on
Sunday, as the mid-level height gradient relaxes across the Northern
Rockies.

The mid-level anticyclone will provide support for maintaining a
surface anticyclone across much of the Intermountain West. Given the
continued a south-to-north oriented trough along the Oregon and
Washington coast, strong, gusty easterly surface winds will once
again remain possible on Monday.

Across the central and eastern United States, broad troughing, rich
tropical moisture, or both will maintain a wet pattern and limited
fire potential.

... Pacific Northwest ...

Elevated fire weather conditions will persist on Monday as gusty
easterly flow of 15 to 20 mph continues in response to the
aforementioned surface-pressure gradient. This pronounced easterly
low-level flow will occur in conjunction with widespread
temperatures over 100 F and numerous areas warming to greater than
110 F,  resulting in elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions. A very deep mixing layer will once again envelop much of
the area resulting in a turbulent and unstable lower troposphere.
These meteorological conditions will also support plume-dominated
fire behavior potential.

... Northwest Arizona, southwest Utah, southern Nevada, into the
central Sierras ...

Mid-level moisture will continue to slowly progress northward on
Monday, resulting in more widespread thunderstorm development than
on Sunday. However, on the leading edge of the moisture return,
moisture may not be sufficiently robust enough to support
precipitation cores that can overcome the dry sub-cloud layer
stemming from strong diurnally driven vertical mixing of the
boundary layer. As such, any thunderstorm that does develop in this
region will have the potential to remain dry.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic into midweek
should be broken by Thursday as the upper trough/low centered over
the Great Lakes directs moisture into much of the East Coast ahead
of a frontal boundary.  It appears that the East Coast will enter
a period of damp/wet weather as we head into the 4th of July
weekend.

...Historic heat wave over the Northwest is forecast to continue
into the 4th of July weekend while becoming less intense...

...Anomalous heat for New England into Wednesday...

...Heavy rain threat from southern Rockies/Plains to the Midwest
midweek should shift south to near the Gulf Coast by the weekend...


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensembles show that the highly anomalous upper ridge
across the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia will lose some
strength by midweek as a compact upper low lifts northward just
off the Pacific Northwest coast and weaken into an open wave.
There is good model agreement that the ridge will expand slowly
eastward into the northern High Plains through the latter half of
the week ahead of a positively-tilted trough initially over the
northern Plains.  There continues to be increasing model signals
for the upper trough to develop into a closed low over the Great
Lakes later this week although the ensemble means tend to retain
the positively-tilted configuration.  Meanwhile, a slow-moving
frontal boundary across the mid-section of the country should
begin to push slowly southward amid increasing model signals for
the upper trough/low over the Great Lakes to dip further south.
This pattern should  bring the heavy rain threat progressively
southward from the mid-South to the Gulf Coast while directing
moisture toward much of the East Coast for the 4th of July weekend
following the early/mid-week heat wave across New England and the
Mid-Atlantic.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean, 12Z ECMWF/ECENS means and some
contributions from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean in an overall pattern with
above average predictability days 3-5 (Wednesday-Friday), followed
by shifting blend focus toward the still compatible ensemble means
by the 4th of July weekend amid gradually increasing forecast
spread.  This maintained fairly good continuity with the previous
WPC forecasts.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge over the Northwest will prolong the
dangerous and oppressive heat over the region.  As the ridge is
forecast to weaken slightly, the heat should become much less
intense by Wednesday near the Pacific Northwest coast but high
temperatures across the interior sections will remain 20 to nearly
30 degrees above normal through late week with some improvement
possible by the 4th of July weekend. Little rainfall is expected
to ease this excessive heat in a pattern with growing drought and
fire threats and minimal recovery overnight will also increase the
heat stress.

Downstream, a positively-tilted upper trough drifting slowly
across the north-central U.S. will solidify and reinforce a wavy
and slow moving front from the southern Plains to the northeastern
U.S. through the medium-range period.  Deep moisture streaming in
from the Gulf of Mexico will continue to help organize showers and
storms which will significantly increase rainfall and runoff
potential along and ahead of the front with an elongated and
focused zone from the southern Rockies/Plains northeastward across
the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast.  Episodes of
cell training and flooding are likely across some of these areas
before the heavy rainfall axis slowly drops southward toward the
Gulf Coast by the 4th of July weekend.

A heat wave across the Northeast to the Mid-Atlantic into midweek
should be broken by Thursday as the upper trough/low centered over
the Great Lakes directs moisture into much of the East Coast ahead
of a frontal boundary.  It appears that the East Coast will enter
a period of damp/wet weather as we head into the 4th of July
weekend.

...Historic and dangerous heat wave to continue throughout the
Northwest...

...Heavy rain could lead to additional instances of flash flooding
over the next few days from the Southern Plains to the Great
Lakes, as well as portions of southwest Louisiana and the Upper
Texas Coast...

...Much above average temperatures found across the Northeast to
end the weekend...

After record-breaking heat was felt over the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Great Basin on Saturday, even hotter temperatures are
forecast today and Monday throughout the region. The same intense
upper-level ridge responsible for the ongoing heat wave is
expected to inch eastward along the U.S.-Canada border through
Tuesday morning. This will allow for several more days of
dangerous heat across the northwest corner of the country, as well
as parts of western Nevada and California. High temperatures are
forecast to soar 20-30+ degrees above average in Washington and
Oregon, including highly populated areas west of the Cascade
Mountains. Highs well into the triple digits will significantly
increase the threat of heat related illnesses. Record-breaking
warm minimum temperatures are forecast as well, with low
temperatures only falling into the 70s ( normally the high
temperature during this time of year). Both Seattle, WA and
Portland, OR are forecast to break their current all-time high
temperature records on Sunday and Monday. In fact, the high
temperature forecast of 112 degrees for Portland, OR today would
break their previous all-time high temperature record by 4
degrees. Parts of Idaho may also threaten daily and monthly
temperature records as heat builds into the region early this
week. Excessive Heat Warnings/Watches and Heat Advisories have
been issued to highlight the unprecedented and abnormal
temperatures for this part of the country. Residents are advised
to find air-conditioned areas, drink plenty of water, and avoid
strenuous activities.

Throughout the central U.S., a stalled frontal boundary will
continue to be the focus for scattered showers and thunderstorms
through at least the middle of the week. This stationary front
currently bisects the country from the Great Lakes to the southern
High Plains and is where much of the active weather can be found.
Flash flooding remains the biggest concern, as multiple days of
heavy rain has led to saturated soil across a large area between
Oklahoma and Lower Michigan. A Slight Risk (level 2/4) of
Excessive Rainfall has been issued for today from eastern New
Mexico to central Illinois. Downpours may also lead to flooding
concerns along the Gulf Coast between southwest Louisiana and the
Upper Texas Coast today and Monday. Tropical moisture and intense
rainfall rates could produce multiple inches of rain in a short
amount of time. Lastly, a surface trough located over the western
Atlantic Ocean is expected to swing into the Southeast on Monday
and could produce scattered thunderstorms and localized heavy
rainfall throughout southeast Georgia and coastal South Carolina.

Heat and humidity are forecast to build into the Northeast to the
end the weekend as a Bermuda high pressure system strengthens over
the Atlantic Ocean and ushers continuous southerly winds up the
East Coast. Even though it will be incomparable to the heat wave
experienced across the Northwest, a few daily high temperature
records could be set. High temperatures 10-15 degrees above
average are forecast over New New England by Monday, with
widespread highs into the low-to-mid 90s expected from the
Mid-Atlantic to southern Maine. Heat Advisories have been issued
for parts of the area.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
1010 AM EST Sun Feb 06 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 09 2022 - 12Z Sun Feb 13 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

It remains the case that a rather amplified upper level pattern
will be in place for this forecast period with a synoptic scale
ridge centered near the West Coast and a broad trough with
multiple embedded shortwaves/fronts over the eastern half of the
nation. There is some signal of a potential pattern change by next
Sunday and beyond as a more active storm track over the northeast
Pacific tries to break down the West Coast ridge.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensemble means remain generally in reasonable agreement
with the larger scale upper-pattern this week, albeit with
numerous timing and focus differences noted with many of the
individual shortwaves. A composite blend of the latest
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the National Blend of Models
seems to offer a reasonable forecast basis for days 3-5
(Wednesday-Friday), with remaining smaller scale detail consistent
with system predictability. This maintains good WPC product
continuity. Transitioned to a blend of the more compatible
GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means next weekend amid growing forecast
spread, but manually adjusted the frontal system approaching the
Northwest a bit slower than the composite indicated as longer
range guidance tends to break down amplified ridges too quickly.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The majority of the continental U.S. will enjoy dry weather and
little in the way of larger scale weather related disruptions
overall this week. There will likely be some rounds of light snow
showers from the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes and New England
as a couple of clipper type systems track across the region, but
they will probably not have a significant source of moisture from
the Gulf or Atlantic, thus keeping QPF modest. Snow showers are
also likely across portions of the Rockies midweek. There is
however a growing guidance signal that supports an emerging area
of rain to spread onward from the Gulf Coast and Southeast later
next weekend as amplified passing system energies pool deeper
moisture into a trailing/wavy front.

of the CONUS. Breezy conditions are expected across from the plains
of MT into the central and southern Plains this afternoon, and may
support brief periods of elevated wind/RH combinations. Marginal
fuel status and low confidence in sustained elevated RH preclude
highlights. Across southern California, building surface high
pressure over the Intermountain West will drive another day of
offshore winds. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are already noted this
morning within the higher terrain of Los Angeles and Ventura
counties, and will likely persist through early Monday. RH
reductions into the teens are expected in the lee of terrain
features, and areas of elevated to critical wind/RH combinations are
probable. While the latest fuel guidance has shown a drying trend in
finer fuels over the past few days, live fuel moisture values remain
too high to support a robust fire weather concern.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 PM CST Sun Feb 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

An Elevated area was introduced for portions of north-central
Montana for Monday. Here, strong downslope flow should favor 3+
hours of minimum RH in the teens to lower/middle 20s and wind gusts
of 30-50 mph -- supported by a multi-model consensus. Upon
collaboration with the local forecast office, fuels are generally
supportive of wildfire-spread where the strong winds and low RH will
develop during the afternoon hours. Confidence in any more than
spotty coverage of critical conditions where the favorable fuels
exist is too limited for an upgrade to Critical at this time, though
one may become necessary in subsequent outlooks. Farther west into
the immediate lee of the higher terrain in Montana, very strong
westerly winds and modest RH reductions are expected, though fuels
appear unfavorable for wildfire-spread -- precluding highlights at
this time. Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains on track (see
below).

..Weinman.. 02/06/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0154 AM CST Sun Feb 06 2022/

...Synopsis...
Monday's fire weather potential will primarily be confined to the
High Plains of MT and coastal southern CA. However, the threat for
both regions will be dependent on fuel conditions, which currently
do not support fire spread.

...Montana...
Mid-level zonal flow is expected to strengthen over the northern
Rockies through the day Monday. As this occurs, winds gusting to
30-50 mph will likely develop across central MT in the lee of the
terrain. Recent guidance hints that downslope warming/drying may
drive RH reductions into the teens and 20s for many locations, but a
large spread in maximum temperatures is noted in recent ensemble
guidance and deterministic runs, which casts some uncertainty into
the RH forecast. Additionally, fuels across the region are only
modestly dry (ERCs between the 60-80th percentile) after recent
rounds of scattered precipitation. Trends in guidance and fuel
status will be monitored for a more robust fire weather concern.

...Coastal Southern California...
Strong offshore gradients winds are expected through Monday morning
along the southern CA coast. Wind gusts up to 30-50 mph are
probable, but should gradually weaken through the afternoon as the
regional pressure gradient slackens. Downslope drying will likely
support RH reductions into the teens for several locations,
supporting periods of elevated to critical conditions. However, the
duration of these conditions may be limited to the morning hours and
high live fuel moisture will further mitigate the overall fire
weather threat.

...Clipper System will produce light snow across the Upper Midwest
through Monday morning...

...A storm off the Southeast Coast will mainly produce rain along
the East Coast and moderate snow for Maine on Monday evening into
Tuesday...

...A warm up for the Northern High/Northern Plains into the
Central Plains...

A Clipper System over the Great Lakes will move slowly into
Southeastern Canada while the cold front dissipates by Tuesday.
The system will produce light snow across parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes by Sunday evening. The snow
will expand into parts of the Ohio Valley on Monday and into the
Lower Great Lakes Monday evening. On Tuesday, the snow will move
into parts of the Central/Northern Appalachians.

Meanwhile, low pressure just offshore of Florida s east coast will
move northeastward, continuing to be just offshore and move into
the Canadian Maritimes by Tuesday evening. As a result, light rain
will develop over parts of the Southeast and move into the
Carolinas on Monday afternoon into Monday evening. By Monday
evening, the rain will expand into the Mid-Atlantic and Southern
New England Coast. Light snow will start over parts of Maine on
Monday evening, also. On Tuesday, the snow will continue over
Maine, with wrap-around moisture producing snow over other parts
of the Northeast. The snowfall totals will be moderate over Maine
and light elsewhere. Furthermore, light rain will continue over
parts of Florida through Tuesday.

Elsewhere, upper-level energy over Texas will aid in producing
light rain along the Western Gulf Coast overnight Sunday into
Monday. Moreover, a weakening front will move onshore over the
Pacific Northwest on early Monday morning into Monday afternoon,
producing light rain over parts of the Northwest Coast. Next, weak
upper-level ridging will aid in warming up the Northern
High/Northern Plains into the Central Plains as temperatures
become 10 to 15 degrees above average. However, the warm
temperatures, dry fuels, and strong wind will produce favorable
conditions for the spread of fire. Therefore, on Tuesday, the SPC
has issued an Elevated area of fire weather over parts of the
Northern High Plains. Lastly, another area of low pressure and
associated front over Central Canada will aid in producing light
snow over parts of the Northern Plains into the Upper Great Lakes
on Tuesday into Tuesday evening.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 06 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 AM EST Mon Feb 7 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Feb 10 2022 - 12Z Mon Feb 14 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

It remains the case that a rather amplified upper level pattern
will be in place for this forecast period with a synoptic scale
ridge centered near the West Coast through Sunday, and a broad
trough with multiple embedded shortwaves/fronts over the eastern
half of the nation.  There is some signal of a potential pattern
change by early next week as a more active storm track over the
northeast Pacific tries to break down the West Coast ridge.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensemble means remain generally in reasonable agreement
with the larger scale upper-pattern this week, albeit with some
timing and focus differences noted with many of the individual
shortwaves.  By Saturday, the 00Z GFS becomes quite amplified with
the trough dropping south across the Rockies and forms a closed
low that lacks ensemble support, but the 18Z was able to be
incorporated into the fronts/pressures forecast.  By next Monday,
the ECMWF becomes very strong with a closed low off the Oregon
Coast, whereas the GFS/CMC favor a more modest shortwave trough.
For the large scale trough developing over the eastern U.S. this
weekend, it still appears that the axis will be positively tilted
and little in the way of phasing regarding northern/southern
stream energy, and this will limit the potential for surface
cyclogenesis off the East Coast as it stands right now.

The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a
deterministic blend through Friday, and then gradually increasing
percentages of the means through next Monday.  For QPF, more of
the ensemble biased corrected model, along with some of the
CMC/GFS/ECMWF, was used since the NBM appears too light with its
QPF across the north-central U.S. for the end of the week.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The majority of the continental U.S. will enjoy dry weather and
little in the way of disruptive weather through the weekend.
There has been a gradual increase with expected snowfall totals
across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region with the strong
clipper system for the end of the week, with some potential for
3-6 inch accumulations across portions of northern Minnesota,
northern Michigan, and downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario.
Farther south, there will likely be an emerging area of showers
from the central Gulf Coast and the Florida Peninsula to the
Southeast U.S. coast over the weekend as moisture flows northward
ahead of an approaching cold front.

In terms of temperatures, the majority of the nation should be
near to slightly above average for highs to close out the week,
with the greatest warm departures on the order of 15-25 degrees
for portions of the Northern Plains on Thursday.  With the trough
building in across the east-central U.S. in time for the weekend,
expect a return to reality with highs running up to 15 degrees
below average from the Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley and
Northeast.  It should be mild once again across most of the Plains
for Sunday and into Monday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 AM CST Mon Feb 07 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
Strong downslope winds are expected to drive fire weather concerns
for both the northern High Plains of central MT as well as coastal
southern CA. Elsewhere, fire weather potential will remain fairly
low due to poor fuel conditions and/or weak winds/high RH.

...Central to Eastern Montana...
Mid-level height falls are noted across the northern Rockies as a
shortwave trough approaches the region. This is strengthening zonal
flow over the terrain and subsequent downslope winds. Observations
from southern AB and central MT are beginning to reflect this
increasing downslope flow with 15-30 mph winds, which is providing
sufficient mixing to prevent overnight RH recovery. Recent guidance
has struggled to capture these recent trends and has initialized too
cool/moist compared to observations. This suggests that afternoon RH
values may fall closer to the drier/warmer solutions that hint at
widespread elevated and isolated critical conditions across the
central to southeastern plains. Despite increasing confidence in dry
conditions with winds gusting to 30-50 mph, latest fuel guidance
suggests that fuel moisture remains somewhat high for most locations
along the Rocky Mountain Front due to recent precipitation. The
Elevated risk area highlights the most favorable overlap of
dry/windy conditions and at least modestly receptive fuels.

...Coastal Southern CA...
A moderate Santa Ana wind event will continue this morning across
coastal southern CA. Wind gusts between 30-50 mph and RH values in
the teens are noted in early-morning observations from Los Angeles
and Ventura counties. These conditions are expected to continue for
the morning hours before gradually diminishing through the afternoon
and evening. Elevated to critical conditions are expected, but will
remain limited to the immediate lee of higher terrain features.
Additionally, live fuel moisture remains too high to support
wildfire spread.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CST Mon Feb 07 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather potential will increase across the central Plains
Tuesday as a surface trough/weak cold front sweeps across the
central CONUS. Offshore winds are expected to increase across
southern California, which may support localized fire weather
concerns.

...Central Plains...
A mid-level wave, currently moving onshore across southwest Canada,
will eject into the Plains through the day Tuesday. As this occurs,
northwesterly winds will increase to 15-25 mph behind a weak surface
trough/cold front. A combination of weak low-level cold advection,
diurnal heating, and downslope warming should support sufficient
boundary-layer mixing for wind gusts between 30-40 mph and RH
reductions between 20-30% across NE and northern KS. Ensemble
guidance supports this general idea with reasonably high
probabilities for sustained elevated wind/RH combinations. Parts of
NE and KS that missed out on recent rain/snowfall over the past 1-2
weeks have seen ERC values climb into the 80-95th percentile, which
will support a fire weather threat. Localized critical conditions
are possible and may be more widespread if boundary-layer mixing is
deeper than currently depicted by most solutions, but confidence in
widespread/sustained critical conditions remains too low for a
higher risk area.

..Southern California...
Most model solutions show the DAG-LAX pressure gradient gradually
strengthening from Tuesday morning through early Wednesday as
surface high pressure slowly builds over the Intermountain West.
Consequently, winds will begin to strengthen Tuesday evening with
gusts up to 30-40 mph possible by early Wednesday morning. Poor RH
recovery is expected over the next 24-48 hours, so RH values in the
teens to low 20s (and elevated to critical fire weather conditions)
appear probable. As with previous days, the overall fire weather
threat will be conditional on fuel status. Currently, fuel moisture
remains too high for a greater concern, but trends will be monitored
through Tuesday.

...A coastal storm to produce and icy wintry mix from the southern
Mid-Atlantic to southern New England today; measurable snowfall
expected in northern New England...

...Rain in South Texas this morning; snow showers in the Great
Lakes; blustery winds in "Big Sky Country" and Southern California
today...

...A warm up for the Northern and Central Plains, quite mild along
the West Coast...

A coastal front and a wave of low pressure connected to an
elongated stationary front is set to cause unsettled weather to
kickoff the first full week of February is set to unfold along the
East Coast. The immediate coastal areas from the Mid-Atlantic can
expect scattered showers this morning and into midday while
coastal New England awaits its round of showers to arrive later
this afternoon. Farther inland, subfreezing temperatures will
result in precipitation falling as an icy wintry mix from the
Delaware Valley to central New England. As the area of low
pressure quickly organizes, snow may fall heavily over central
Maine, resulting in snowfall accumulations exceeding 6 inches.
Slick spots on roads are possible in these areas, especially in
New England where a glaze of ice and light snow accumulations have
resulted in the issuance of Winter Weather Advisories today.
Freezing rain is possible as far south as the North Carolina
Piedmont, where Winter Weather Advisories are in effect due to the
potential for hazardous travel conditions. Farther south, the same
frontal boundary combined with the approach of an upper level
trough from the South Central U.S. fosters a suitable environment
for spotty showers across much of Florida Monday night into
Tuesday.

Elsewhere, most of the U.S. from the Mississippi River on westward
to the West Coast can expect mostly dry conditions. One lone
exception is the lower Rio Grande Valley where periods of rain,
falling heavily at times, is forecast in the early morning hours
today. Drier conditions return to far South Texas the second half
of the day as high pressure builds in from the north. In the Great
Lakes, a weak and slow moving frontal system continues to be a
catalyst for scattered snow showers throughout the region, leading
to light snow accumulations from the U.P. of Michigan to areas
downwind and east of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Farther west, an
approaching upper level disturbance delivers a surge in winds
throughout much of Montana. High Wind Watches and Warnings have
been issued for parts of the state due to the potential for wind
gusts as high as 60 mph today and into Monday evening. In addition
to the gusty winds, low humidity levels and abnormally mild
conditions makes for favorable fire weather conditions. This has
led to the Storm Prediction Center issuing an Elevated Risk for
fire weather in eastern Montana today. Blustery conditions are
also possible in southern California where strong high pressure in
the Intermountain West and a surface trough along the coast
supports the potential for wind gusts up to 50 mph in the
Transverse Range later today.

Temperature-wise, the most abnormally cool temperatures will be
located along the Gulf Coast with South Florida clinging to
seasonally warm temperatures. The Northeast will warm to more
seasonal levels compared to the very cold temperatures observed
over the weekend. The warmest temperature anomalies will be
located in the Northern and Central Plains where daily average
temperature anomalies of 15 to 25 degrees above normal give
residents in these regions and early taste of spring-like warmth.
Speaking of "spring-like", the West Coast will also be
experiencing temperatures that are quite mild as well. By
mid-week, much of the Lower 48 will be under the influence of a
milder temperature regime, although cooler temperatures look to
return to parts of the Great Lakes the second half of the week.

showers this morning and into midday while coastal New England
awaits its round of showers to arrive later this afternoon.
Farther inland, subfreezing temperatures will result in
precipitation falling as an icy wintry mix from the Delaware
Valley to central New England. As the area of low pressure quickly
organizes, snow may fall heavily over central Maine resulting in
snowfall accumulations exceeding 6 inches. Slick spots on roads
are possible in these areas, especially in New England where a
glaze of ice and light snow accumulations have resulted in the
issuance of Winter Weather Advisories today. Freezing rain is
possible as far south as the North Carolina Piedmont, where Winter
Weather Advisories are in effect due to the potential for
hazardous travel conditions this morning. Farther south, the same
frontal boundary combined with the approach of an upper level
trough from the South Central U.S. fosters a suitable environment
for spotty showers across much of Florida Monday night into
Tuesday.

Elsewhere, much of the U.S. from the Mississippi River on westward
to the West Coast can expect mostly dry conditions. One lone
exception is the lower Rio Grande Valley where periods of rain,
falling heavily at times, is forecast in the early morning hours
today. Drier conditions return to far South Texas the second half
of the day as high pressure builds in from the north. In the Great
Lakes, a weak and slow moving frontal system continues to be a
catalyst for scattered snow showers throughout the region, leading
to light snow accumulations from the U.P. of Michigan to areas
downwind and east of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Farther west, an
approaching upper level disturbance delivers a surge in winds
throughout much of Montana. High Wind Watches and Warnings have
been issued for parts of the state due to the potential for wind
gusts as high as 60 mph today and into Monday evening. In addition
to the gusty winds, low humidity levels and abnormally mild
conditions makes for favorable fire weather conditions. This has
led to the Storm Prediction Center issuing an Elevated Risk for
fire weather in eastern Montana today. Blustery conditions are
also possible in southern California where strong high pressure in
the Intermountain West and a surface trough along the coast
supports the potential for wind gusts up to 50 mph in the
Transverse Range later today.

Temperature-wise, the most abnormally cool temperatures will be
located along the Gulf Coast with South Florida clinging to
seasonally warm temperatures. The Northeast will warm to more
seasonal temperatures compared to the very cold air-mass observed
over the weekend. The warmest temperature anomalies will be
located in the Northern and Central Plains where daily average
temperature anomalies of 15 to 25 degrees above normal give
residents in these regions and early taste of spring-like warmth.
Speaking of "spring-like", the West Coast will also be
experiencing temperatures that are quite mild as well. By
mid-week, much of the Lower 48 will be under the influence of a
milder temperature regime, although cooler temperatures look to
return to parts of the Great Lakes the second half of the week.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0220 AM CST Sat Dec 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level long-wave trough will continue to move across the
eastern United States on Saturday, leaving behind a
shorter-wavelength trough across north-central Mexico. At the
surface, a low pressure will move rapidly eastward from the Ohio
Valley to off the southeast coast of Cape Cod by Sunday morning. A
cold front trailing southwest from this low will push south and east
through Saturday, ending up stretching from south of Brownsville,
TX, northeast to the coastal waters south of Cape Cod.

In the wake of the cold front, a dry continental airmass will spread
south across the central United States. This dry airmass will
support relative humidity percentages falling into the teens to low
twenties across portions of northwest and west Texas, despite
surface temperatures struggling to broach 50 F. These dry conditions
will combine with gusty northerly winds around 20 mph to result in
elevated meteorological fire conditions. However, these conditions
should occur mostly south of the drier fuels across the Texas
Panhandle, and no fire weather highlights are currently needed.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

From Tuesday into Christmas Day/Saturday, most guidance continues
to show that impulses rounding an impressively strong central
Pacific upper ridge should provide periodic reinforcement of a
deep upper trough aligned just off the West Coast. This trough
will likely contain one or more upper lows, and a persistent flow
of moisture ahead of the trough axis will likely produce a
multi-day period of significant precipitation over parts of the
West Coast (northern/central California in particular) with
meaningful amounts also extending into the Rockies. Southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow will carry along a couple waves
with modest precipitation before lower 48 flow becomes more
dominated by what energy may eject from the eastern Pacific
trough. Farther south, a southern stream system tracking from
northern Florida or vicinity into the Atlantic may bring some rain
to the Southeast early in the forecast period. Expect a broadening
area of above normal temperatures over the southern two-thirds of
the central U.S. while the extreme northern Plains will tend to
see below normal temperatures.

The eastern Pacific upper trough does show better agreement on the
large scale compared to previous days, but day to day details
regarding feature interactions and timing continue to be
problematic, especially beyond day 4. The 00z CMC at this time is
the outlier as it separates energy dropping south from the Gulf of
Alaska and accelerates it much faster into the Western U.S. than
the other models. The 00z ECMWF is also a little faster with the
troughing (more phased) while the 06z GFS is the most amplified
and thus slowest. The ensemble means would favor a solution more
in between the GFS and ECMWF which seems reasonable at this time.

Trouble continues further downstream with the details of
individual waves and fronts moving through the northern Plains and
upper Great Lakes, the dynamics of some likely dependent on energy
ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough. Meanwhile, large
scale agreement is decent for the southern stream low moving
across northern Florida or the Southeast into the western Atlantic
with some timing and structure questions remaining.

The updated WPC medium range progs for today used a blend of the
operational models (with more emphasis towards the GFS/ECMWF over
the CMC/UKMET) for days 3-4. After that, increasingly added more
weighting to the ensemble means, eliminating the CMC due to
problems discussed above. Kept some degree of ECMWF and GFS just
for a little added system definition. This allowed for fairly good
continuity with the previous shift with no major changes or
adjustments needed.

Expect the western U.S. to see a broadening area of rain and
mountain snow downstream from the persistent upper trough just
offshore the West Coast, with some of this activity likely to be
moderate to heavy.  There are still question marks for some of the
details due to uncertainty over individual systems and their
interaction, but guidance signals and teleconnections for the mean
pattern are consistent in showing northern and central California
as having the highest precipitation potential through the
period--including heavy snow over Sierra Nevada/Shasta areas.
This region should see the most consistent moisture flow and
experience southern/western facing terrain enhancement.  It may
take into the shorter-range time frame to asses the location and
intensity of lower elevation rainfall with respect to local
runoff/flooding issues.  Effects from the multi-day accumulation
of precipitation will also require monitoring even if it is not
intense on any particular day.  Some moisture may extend as far
south as southern California and Arizona by mid-late week, while
the Interior West and Rockies should see meaningful precipitation
as well.

Low pressure tracking from over or near northern Florida into the
Atlantic will spread rain across portions of the Southeast on
Tuesday and possibly into Wednesday.  Some locations over the
Southeast/Florida could see moderate to locally heavy rainfall.
Some uncertainty persists for the intensity and northward extent
of rainfall though latest trends are increasing the potential for
meaningful totals over parts of the extreme Southeast.  A leading
northern tier system should spread mostly light snow from the
extreme northern Plains eastward through the Great Lakes and New
England during Tuesday-Wednesday.  The system's accompanying front
should be relatively dry.  Any trailing features could produce
some precipitation but again likely with fairly light amounts.


Above normal temperatures focused over the central/south-central
High Plains on Tuesday will steadily expand eastward across the
southern two-thirds of the central U.S. with time and gradually
become more anomalous.  Through midweek highs in this region will
tend to be 10-20F or slightly more above normal.  Toward the end
of the week there should be more locations with highs 20-30F above
normal and some record highs could be challenged over the southern
Plains by Christmas Day/Saturday.  On the other extreme, the far
northern Plains should see below normal temperatures except for
perhaps being near normal Wednesday in between systems.  A
stronger push of cold air may reach Montana and the Dakotas next
weekend.  The unsettled pattern over the West should lead to near
or above normal lows and near to below normal highs through the
entire week.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

From Tuesday into Christmas Day/Saturday, most guidance continues
to show that impulses rounding an impressively strong central
Pacific upper ridge should provide periodic reinforcement of a
deep upper trough aligned just off the West Coast. This trough
will likely contain one or more upper lows, and a persistent flow
of moisture ahead of the trough axis will likely produce a
multi-day period of significant precipitation over parts of the
West Coast (northern/central California in particular) with
meaningful amounts also extending into the Rockies. Southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow will carry along a couple waves
with modest precipitation before lower 48 flow becomes more
dominated by what energy may eject from the eastern Pacific
trough. Farther south, a southern stream system tracking from
northern Florida or vicinity into the Atlantic may bring some rain
to the Southeast early in the forecast period. Expect a broadening
area of above normal temperatures over the southern two-thirds of
the central U.S. while the extreme northern Plains will tend to
see below normal temperatures.

The eastern Pacific upper trough does show better agreement on the
large scale compared to previous days, but day to day details
regarding feature interactions and timing continue to be
problematic, especially beyond day 4. The 00z CMC at this time is
the outlier as it separates energy dropping south from the Gulf of
Alaska and accelerates it much faster into the Western U.S. than
the other models. The 00z ECMWF is also a little faster with the
troughing (more phased) while the 06z GFS is the most amplified
and thus slowest. The ensemble means would favor a solution more
in between the GFS and ECMWF which seems reasonable at this time.

Trouble continues further downstream with the details of
individual waves and fronts moving through the northern Plains and
upper Great Lakes, the dynamics of some likely dependent on energy
ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough. Meanwhile, large
scale agreement is decent for the southern stream low moving
across northern Florida or the Southeast into the western Atlantic
with some timing and structure questions remaining.

The updated WPC medium range progs for today used a blend of the
operational models (with more emphasis towards the GFS/ECMWF over
the CMC/UKMET) for days 3-4. After that, increasingly added more
weighting to the ensemble means, eliminating the CMC due to
problems discussed above. Kept some degree of ECMWF and GFS just
for a little added system definition. This allowed for fairly good
continuity with the previous shift with no major changes or
adjustments needed.

Expect the western U.S. to see a broadening area of rain and
mountain snow downstream from the persistent upper trough just

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0107 PM CST Sat Dec 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

Tomorrow's fire weather forecast remains mostly on track with only a
minor northeastward expansion needed to the Elevated fire weather
area over the southern High Plains based on the latest weather and
fuel guidance.

Elsewhere, at least locally elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely across portions of southeast Wyoming and far
north-central/northeastern Colorado into portions of
western/west-central Nebraska. This area will be near the southern
edge of a corridor of enhanced zonal mid-level flow moving along the
U.S./Canadian border. Very strong sustained winds in excess of 25
mph (much stronger gusts) are anticipated in conjunction with
minimum RH values perhaps between 15-25%. At the moment, uncertainty
remains relatively high regarding the degree of the surface warming
(and associated RH reductions), with the forecast envelop of high
temperatures between 40-50 F. Furthermore, while background ERC
percentiles are exceeding the 80-90th percentile, visible satellite
imagery currently shows a light cover of snow where the most
favorable overlap of wind/rh is expected tomorrow (across
southeastern Wyoming). Thus, there is some uncertainty on how
quickly fuels will respond after the snow melts today into tomorrow,
which further decreases confidence in larger-scale fire weather
conditions. This area will continue to be closely monitored in
future outlooks for the possible inclusion of fire weather
highlights.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CST Sat Dec 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
As the mid-level long-wave trough moves quickly off the East Coast
on Sunday, a broad mid-level ridge from coast-to-coast will take
hold across the southern United States. At the same time, a
short-wave trough embedded within this broader ridge, will move from
north-central Mexico and into central Texas, and a potent short-wave
trough will move across south-central Canada. At the surface, lee
troughing will develop across much of the High Plains as mid-level
winds turn westerly and strengthen in response to the strong
mid-level short-wave trough moving across southern Canada.

... Southern High Plains ...

Surface winds will turn southerly and increase on Sunday in response
to the strengthening surface-pressure gradient between the lee
trough to the west and the antecedent surface high pressure farther
east across the central Plains. This dry return-flow pattern will
result in elevated fire-weather meteorological conditions on Sunday
across portions of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles and surrounding
areas. Here, the downslope component to the surface flow will allow
temperatures to warm into the 50s with minimum relative humidity
percentages falling into the mid-to-upper teens. With very dry fuels
in place, this dry airmass will combine with surface winds ranging
between 15 and 20 mph (with locally higher gusts in excess of 25 mph
possible) to result in elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorm threat this afternoon and
evening from the southern Plains to Ohio Valley...

...Moderate to heavy snow expected across northern New England
this evening into Sunday; freezing rain from upstate New York to
central New England...

...Heavy snow to impact the Cascades and far Northern Rockies
today, lingering into Monday...

A low pressure system is lifting through the Ohio Valley Valley
today and its attendant cold front is slowly passing through the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys, the Lower Mississippi Valley and the
Southern Plains today; which is acting as a focus for showers and
thunderstorms. Moderate to heavy rainfall is occurring over parts
of Texas and Louisiana with another cluster of storms over
Alabama, Florida and Georgia- both areas WPC has highlighted as
having an elevated threat for excessive rainfall and local
flooding concerns.

This system is forecast to intensify as it tracks toward the New
England coast by tonight, which will reduce the risk for excessive
rainfall along the Gulf while bringing a round of snow and some
mixed precipitation across the lower Great Lakes. Moderate to
heavy snow is forecast to overspread northern New England from
west to east as the low pressure wave intensifies and tracks near
the southern New England coast.  Areas from upstate New York to
central New England should see sleet, freezing rain, and/or snow
tonight before the low quickly exits out to sea on Sunday. The
wintry mix is expected to taper off/diminish across that region by
Sunday afternoon with  showers and thunderstorms continuing for
the East Coast and Southeast.

A few inches of coastal/lower elevation rain is expected across
the coastal Northwest along with with heavy snow in the Cascades
as another round of moisture moves onshore. Local amounts of 2
feet of snow will be possible in the highest elevations of the
northern Cascades. With the system settling a bit into Oregon on
Sunday, it will elevate the risk for excessive rainfall and
localized runoff concerns. WPC has issued a Marginal Risk area for
excessive rainfall for parts of western Oregon. This system is
then forecast to push back northward Sunday night into Monday as a
cyclone is forecast to expand and push northward off the West
Coast.  Some of the heavier precipitation will then spread
northward from Oregon into Washington by Monday, with the chances
for snow expanding eastward into northern Montana and Idaho
possibly totaling up to 10 inches. Colder air will enter the
Northern Plains Sunday night into Monday behind an Alberta
clipper.  Snow associated with the cold front is forecast to be
light.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase across southern
Texas later this weekend as a low pressure system is forecast to
develop along a meandering front in the western Gulf of Mexico.

300 PM EST Sat December 18 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and ensembles continue to show only slow evolution
of the upper pattern through the Wednesday-Sunday period.
Impulses flowing around the north side of a very strong
central/east-central Pacific upper ridge should reinforce a mean
trough whose axis should gradually drift from the eastern Pacific
to the West Coast or very slightly inland.  Fast flow will prevail
downstream, between low heights over central Canada and an upper
high forecast to migrate eastward across Mexico and the southern
Gulf of Mexico.  This pattern will favor multiple days of
widespread precipitation over the West with the Sierra Nevada
likely to see the highest five-day totals.  Systems to the east of
the Rockies will initially have dynamic support from southern
Canada/northern tier U.S. flow and then become more dependent on
features ejecting from the West Coast trough.  Much above normal
temperatures will prevail over the southern half to two-thirds of
the Plains with some of this warmth extending eastward with time.
Meanwhile the far northern Plains should see a pronounced colder
trend by next weekend.

Guidance through the 12Z/18Z cycles still displayed some important
detail differences for features within the eastern Pacific/West
Coast mean trough with eventual implications on the forecast
across the lower 48.  During mid-late week the primary issue has
been the character of digging energy that replaces an initial
short-term upper low.  GFS runs had been eager to close off
another offshore upper low whose energy takes longer to eject
inland, thus leading to a slower system reaching the East by next
weekend.  Aside from one ECMWF run, that model has tended to be
more open with the shortwave with faster ejection--but generally
not as fast as latest CMC runs.  Ensemble means have been
providing a good middle ground among these options.  By next
weekend the means end up gravitating toward the 12Z ECMWF idea of
a well-defined system reaching the Great Lakes on Christmas
Day/Saturday and the Canadian Maritimes on Sunday.  The fast
nature of the mean flow over most of the lower 48 would seem to
favor this idea versus the slower 12Z/18Z GFS as well.  The new
00Z GFS has made a significant adjustment toward the majority
cluster, now showing more north-south elongation of the mid-late
week energy instead of a slow upper low and then faster ejection
thereafter.  Later in the period the GFS/ECMWF and their means
compare fairly well for the West Coast trough as additional energy
reinforces the feature, with differences well within typical
error/guidance spread for forecasts that far out in time.

Early in the period over the East, consensus has been stable in
recent runs for the system crossing southeastern Canada and
northeastern U.S. around midweek.  However guidance is still
having some difficulties in resolving the details of the system
expected to be just off the North Carolina coast early Wednesday
and continue over the Atlantic thereafter, favoring an
intermediate approach.

The operational model blend used to start the forecast for
Wednesday began to incorporate the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means by day
5 Friday and then reached 60 percent total ensemble weight by day
7 Sunday.  The forecast excluded the CMC by the latter half of the
period and 12Z/18Z GFS weight was kept low enough to minimize
influence of its slower handling of late week West Coast energy.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A broad area of the western U.S. will see rain and mountain snow
during the period, supported by a persistent flow of moisture
ahead of an eastern Pacific/West Coast upper trough.  Some of this
activity will likely be moderate to heavy though it will take
additional time to resolve the finer details due to uncertainty
over individual systems and their interaction.  However guidance
signals and teleconnections for the mean pattern still suggest
that northern and central California should have the highest
precipitation potential over the five-day period--including heavy
snow over Sierra Nevada/Shasta areas.  The greatest liquid
equivalent totals should be over favored terrain along the Sierra
Nevada.  It may still take into the shorter-range time frame to
asses the location and intensity of lower elevation rainfall with
respect to local runoff/flooding issues over California.  Effects
from the multi-day accumulation of precipitation will also require
monitoring even if it is not intense on any particular day.  Some
moisture should extend as far south as southern California and
Arizona after midweek while favored terrain over the Great Basin
and northern/central Rockies will see meaningful precipitation as
well.

Low pressure tracking away from near the North Carolina Coast may
be accompanied by a little rain early Wednesday while passage of a
southeastern Canada system and a weak upstream feature may produce
light snow over the upper Great Lakes and northern New England.
Latest guidance is signaling a more organized system could produce
snow or rain depending on latitude between the northern Plains and
Great Lakes/Northeast, though differences in evolution keep
confidence low for resolving coverage and intensity of
precipitation at this time.

Above normal temperatures over the southern two-thirds of the High
Plains on Wednesday will expand eastward across the Plains and
into the Mississippi Valley later in the week, with increasing
coverage of highs at least 15-25F above normal.  Such readings
will likely persist over the southern half of the
Plains/Mississippi Valley through next weekend.  A few record
highs may be possible over Texas during this warm period.  Some of
this warmth should also reach the East with highs reaching 10-20F
above normal by the end of the week or next weekend.  On the other
hand the far northern Plains should see a pronounced colder trend
during the weekend as temperatures drop to 15-30F below normal
over parts of Montana and North Dakota.  The unsettled pattern
over the West should lead to near or above normal lows and near to
below normal highs through the entire week.  Western highs should
gradually trend cooler with time as the axis of the eastern
Pacific upper trough reaches at least as far as the West Coast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0128 AM CST Sun Dec 19 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level long-wave trough will move off the east coast on Sunday,
leaving a generally broad, coast-to-coast ridge in its wake.
Embedded within the broad ridge, a strong short-wave trough will
move from north-central Mexico into central Texas and another strong
trough will move across southern Canada. At the surface, a dry
continental airmass will continue to settle across much of the
eastern United States in the wake of a cold front passage.

... Southern High Plains ...

Dry return flow is in the process of establishing itself early this
morning as lee troughing develops and the surface high pressure
moves east. Sustained winds this afternoon will range from 15-20
mph, with gusts locally in excess of 25 mph possible. The downslope
component of the flow will support temperatures quickly recovering
into the 50s F by afternoon with minimum relative humidity
percentages falling into the teens. The result will be elevated to
locally critical fire conditions across the region.

... Central High Plains ...

Low-to-mid-level westerly flow is expected to strengthen this
morning into the afternoon across southeast Wyoming into central
Nebraska as the strong mid-level trough moves across southern
Canada. This westerly downslope flow around 20 mph with gusts in
excess of 30 mph should allow temperatures to quickly warm into the
40s F to low 50s F by early afternoon. Given the dry antecedent
airmass, afternoon minimum relative humidity percentages will fall
into the teens to low twenties despite the relatively cool surface
temperatures. The result will be elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions for a couple of hours. Mitigating factors for a
more robust threat include recent precipitation (snow) and the
relatively short daylight hours limiting the duration of afternoon
heating.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The broad, coast-to-coast mid-level ridge from Sunday will amplify
across the western United States in response to a strong, deep low
off the California coast. Farther east, a strong short-wave trough
will continue moving across the Southeast and a series of short-wave
troughs move across southern Canada. At the surface, a reinforcing
shot of a modified continental polar airmass will push south into
the central Plains in the wake of a dry cold front, keeping in place
a dry airmass.

Despite the antecedent dry airmass across the High Plains,
relatively weak low-level flow should temporarily temper large-scale
fire concerns.

...Snow across northern New England as well as
showers/thunderstorms along the Eastern Seaboard will taper off
later today as low pressure system moves off the East Coast...

...Unsettled weather lingers over the Pacific Northwest, the
northern Rockies and into the northern High Plains...

...Low pressure system forms over the Gulf of Mexico and moves
toward Florida by Tuesday morning...

A low pressure system centered near the New England coast early
this morning will continues to intensify as it slides quickly
offshore.  Snow across northern New England early this morning
will gradually taper off during the day.  Meanwhile, scattered
showers and some thunderstorms further south along the Eastern
Seaboard will linger a bit longer today but will eventually slide
off the coast behind a cold front by this evening.  Fine and more
seasonably cold temperatures will prevail across much of the
central to eastern U.S. beginning on Monday when a high pressure
system dominates the weather pattern.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is expected to continue across the
Pacific Northwest.  A few inches of coastal/lower elevation rain
and heavy snow in the Cascades can be expected. The system
settling a bit into Oregon today. This system is then forecast to
push back northward Sunday night into Monday as a cyclone is
forecast to expand and push northward off the West Coast.  Some of
the heavier precipitation will then spread northward from Oregon
into Washington by Monday, with the chances for snow expanding
eastward into northern Montana and Idaho possibly totaling up to
10 inches. Colder air will enter the Northern Plains Sunday night
into Monday behind an Alberta clipper.  Snow associated with the
cold front is forecast to be light.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase across southern
Texas later this weekend as a low pressure system is forecast to
develop along a meandering front in the western Gulf of Mexico.

...Snow across northern New England as well as
showers/thunderstorms along the Eastern Seaboard will taper off
later today as low pressure system moves off the East Coast...

...Unsettled weather lingers over the Pacific Northwest, the
northern Rockies and into the northern High Plains...

...Low pressure system forms over the Gulf of Mexico and moves
toward Florida by Tuesday morning...

A low pressure system centered near the New England coast early
this morning will continue to intensify as it slides quickly
offshore.  Snow across northern New England early this morning
will gradually taper off during the day.  Meanwhile, scattered
showers and some thunderstorms further south along the Eastern
Seaboard will linger a bit longer today but they will eventually
slide off the coast behind a cold front by this evening.  Fine
weather with more seasonably cold temperatures will prevail across
much of the central to eastern U.S. beginning on Monday when a
high pressure system dominates the weather pattern.

Meanwhile, unsettled weather is expected to continue across the
Pacific Northwest as arctic air attempts to filter in from Canada
while a low pressure system develops off the West Coast.  A few
inches of coastal/lower elevation rain and more than a foot of
heavy snow in the Cascades can be expected.  The precipitation
will be oriented near a stationary front Oregon today.  The front
is forecast to push northward tonight into Monday as a cyclone
continues to develop off the West Coast.  In the mean time, some
of the heavy snow will extend eastward into northern Idaho
northern Montana and Idaho where an arctic front dips slowly
across the area.

An Alberta clipper moving quickly across the Canadian prairies
will bring colder air into the northern Plains today.  Snow
associated with the cold front trailing from the clipper will be
light across the upper Great Lakes later today followed by
interior New England on Monday and into Tuesday morning.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase across southern
Texas today as a low pressure system is forecast to develop along
a meandering front in the western Gulf of Mexico.  The low is
expected to track eastward toward Florida on Tuesday where showers
and thunderstorms will be on the increase Monday night into
Tuesday.  Some of the showers will also brush the Gulf Coast from
west to east as the low pressure system develops in the Gulf.

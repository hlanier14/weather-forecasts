Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1107 AM CDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 061700Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN
WYOMING...

The forecast remains generally on track with only minor adjustments
for the latest guidance. Widespread elevated/critical fire weather
conditions are expected through much of this afternoon across the
Northern/Central Rockies. See the previous discussion for more
details.

..Lyons.. 09/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Mon Sep 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge/anticyclone will persist across the western U.S.,
with a mid-level trough amplifying while cresting the upper ridge
and ejecting into the northern Plains today. Widespread 30-60 kt 500
mb flow will overspread a relatively dry boundary layer behind a
southward-advancing surface cold front. As such, widespread 15-25
mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds coinciding with
10-20% RH are expected across the central/northern Rockies.
Widespread Elevated highlights have been maintained to address the
overall favorable surface meteorological conditions given forecast
fuel ERCs at/above the 80th percentile.

While locally Critical conditions are expected across the entire
Elevated area, a regional corridor of more focused Critical
conditions appears likely across portions of central into southeast
Wyoming by afternoon peak heating, as shown by several model
guidance members. Critical highlights were introduced where 20 mph
sustained westerly surface winds are expected to overlap 10-15% RH
for at least a few hours. With at least 25 mph sustained westerly
winds expected across portions of southern and eastern Montana, more
widespread Critical meteorological conditions may manifest. However,
cooling temperatures and recovering RH in the 20-30% range render
confidence too low to add Critical highlights into Montana at this
time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
228 PM EDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Sep 09 2021 - 12Z Mon Sep 13 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with an upper high
over the Four Corners region and mid-upper troughing across the
eastern third of the country. The upper high is forecast to weaken
and shift/expand eastward toward the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley through the period and allow for quasi-zonal
flow to take hold across much of the CONUS, suggesting lower
confidence in system timing/details. The pattern remains rather
dry with generally near to above normal temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Model guidance aligned pretty well for the early part of the
medium range period with the pattern described above. However, by
late week as the pattern deamplifies fairly quickly, several
features will contribute to forecast uncertainty and cause timing
and amplitude differences particularly with shortwaves moving
through the quasi-zonal flow. These include variations with flow
out of the Pacific, differences in positioning and strength of
troughing across Canada, and the manner in which the broad-scale
flow interacts with what is currently Hurricane Larry as it
transitions to an extratropical cyclone. Run-to-run continuity is
also poor, leading to added uncertainty. However, the overall
pattern appears to be handled reasonably well by the GEFS and EC
ensemble means, though confidence in the smaller-scale details is
low. Through Friday, a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z
models was able to be used (that guidance happened to be fairly
agreeable on a shortwave moving through southwestern Canada into
the north-central U.S., though the 06Z GFS had different timing),
but the forecast shifted to a blend mainly of the ensemble means
by early next week to reduce the effects of the variations in the
deterministic models.

In terms of possible tropical development, a tropical system is
likely to form in the East Pacific per the National Hurricane
Center but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja California.
In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look likely into
the northern/northeastern Gulf later this week, so maintained a
modest QPF signal across the FL Panhandle northeastward, but
ultimately need to wait and see if any organization will occur.
Please see the NHC outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front along much of
I-95 Thursday morning, with its tail-end lingering over the
Southeast for a few days before dissipating. Amounts should
generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf and western
Atlantic coasts (FL/GA/Carolinas), where tropical moisture may
support modest to perhaps locally heavier amounts. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through the
Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA (Sierra) into the Great Basin and parts of
the Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front. These amounts should be generally light as well.
With shortwaves and frontal systems traversing across the
north-central to northeastern U.S., periods of rain showers can be
expected there. By around Monday, another possible low pressure
system with tropical moisture inflow could spread rain toward
western parts of the Gulf Coast, but uncertainty remains high.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially over the Rockies and High Plains ahead of the incoming
Pacific front/trough Thu-Fri. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above
normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week into the weekend and
toward the Middle Mississippi Valley next week. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front later this week, moderating a
bit over the weekend as the surface high settles over the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
228 PM EDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Sep 09 2021 - 12Z Mon Sep 13 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with an upper high
over the Four Corners region and mid-upper troughing across the
eastern third of the country. The upper high is forecast to weaken
and shift/expand eastward toward the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley through the period and allow for quasi-zonal
flow to take hold across much of the CONUS, suggesting lower
confidence in system timing/details. The pattern remains rather
dry with generally near to above normal temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Model guidance aligned pretty well for the early part of the
medium range period with the pattern described above. However, by
late week as the pattern deamplifies fairly quickly, several
features will contribute to forecast uncertainty and cause timing
and amplitude differences particularly with shortwaves moving
through the quasi-zonal flow. These include variations with flow
out of the Pacific, differences in positioning and strength of
troughing across Canada, and the manner in which the broad-scale
flow interacts with what is currently Hurricane Larry as it
transitions to an extratropical cyclone. Run-to-run continuity is
also poor, leading to added uncertainty. However, the overall
pattern appears to be handled reasonably well by the GEFS and EC
ensemble means, though confidence in the smaller-scale details is
low. Through Friday, a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z
models was able to be used (that guidance happened to be fairly
agreeable on a shortwave moving through southwestern Canada into
the north-central U.S., though the 06Z GFS had different timing),
but the forecast shifted to a blend mainly of the ensemble means
by early next week to reduce the effects of the variations in the
deterministic models.

In terms of possible tropical development, a tropical system is
likely to form in the East Pacific per the National Hurricane
Center but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja California.
In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look likely into
the northern/northeastern Gulf later this week, so maintained a
modest QPF signal across the FL Panhandle northeastward, but
ultimately need to wait and see if any organization will occur.
Please see the NHC outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front along much of
I-95 Thursday morning, with its tail-end lingering over the
Southeast for a few days before dissipating. Amounts should
generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf and western
Atlantic coasts (FL/GA/Carolinas), where tropical moisture may
support modest to perhaps locally heavier amounts. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through the
Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA (Sierra) into the Great Basin and parts of
the Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front. These amounts should be generally light as well.
With shortwaves and frontal systems traversing across the
north-central to northeastern U.S., periods of rain showers can be
expected there. By around Monday, another possible low pressure
system with tropical moisture inflow could spread rain toward
western parts of the Gulf Coast, but uncertainty remains high.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially over the Rockies and High Plains ahead of the incoming
Pacific front/trough Thu-Fri. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above
normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week into the weekend and
toward the Middle Mississippi Valley next week. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front later this week, moderating a
bit over the weekend as the surface high settles over the region.

FOR TUESDAY SEPTEMBER 14 - MONDAY SEPTEMBER 20: Mid-level ridging forecast
across the east-central CONUS later in week-1 is forecast to weaken by the
start of week-2, with the flow pattern expected to become more zonal. At th=
e
start of the period, the 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles depict
positive
850-hPa temperature anomalies of +10 to +20 deg F across portions of the Gr=
eat
Plains, Mississippi Valley, and extending into parts of the Midwest, which
would be indicative of a late summer heat wave over these areas. While surf=
ace
temperatures in the 80s and lower 90s deg F appear likely over a broad regi=
on
of the eastern half of the CONUS, humidity values are generally forecast to=
 be
on the lower side heading into mid-September, which would prevent many area=
s
from reaching excessive heat criteria, despite the anomalously warm
temperatures. The exception is across parts of the Southern Great Plains an=
d
Lower Mississippi Valley where increased southerly moisture flow, combined
with
relatively warmer temperatures compared to farther north, may result in hea=
t
index values greater than 105 deg F. A slight risk for excessive heat is
highlighted from Sep 14 to Sep 16 over these areas, and is supported by the
consolidated heat risk tool which indicates probabilities of at least 20% f=
or
heat indices exceeding 105 deg F over the highlighted region. Cooling
resources
may be limited across portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley due to ongoi=
ng
power outages in the wake of Hurricane Ida. This may lead to increased risk
for
heat related health impacts across the region.



Surface high pressure forecast over the eastern CONUS favors enhanced
southerly
return flow along the western Gulf of Mexico Coast, increasing the chances =
of
heavy rain over parts of the Southern Great Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley. Recent deterministic solutions of the GFS and Canadian models also
indicate the potential for a tropical disturbance to track close to the reg=
ion
early in the period or just prior, further increasing the heavy rain threat=
.
Both the ECMWF reforecast tool and the uncalibrated 0z ECMWF ensemble depic=
t
parts of southeastern Texas and southern Louisiana having at least a 20%
chance
for 3-day precipitation totals exceeding 1-inch, supportive of a slight ris=
k
for heavy rain over these areas from Sep 14 to Sep 18.



Anomalous troughing is forecast across the Bering Sea and western Mainland
Alaska during week-2. The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles indicate
surface low pressure tracking across southern Alaska during the middle of
week-2, which would align with the highest chances for high winds and heavy
precipitation. However, due to exact timing uncertainties this far out, the
associated wind and precipitation hazards are designated for the entire wee=
k-2
period. A slight risk of high wind speeds is highlighted across the Aleutia=
ns,
Alaska Peninsula, coastal southern Mainland, and the Panhandle due to the
favorable synoptic set-up, and also supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool,
which depicts probabilities greater than 20% for wind speeds exceeding the
85th
climatological percentile over parts of the highlighted region. The enhance=
d
southwesterly flow ahead of the trough axis favors increasing precipitation
chances across southeastern Alaska. Both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tool=
s
depict probabilities of at least 20% for 3-day precipitation exceeding 2-
inches
across coastal portions of the southern Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle,
increasing in spatial coverage by the middle of the period. This supports t=
he
continuation of the slight risk of heavy precipitation. There are indicatio=
ns
that some of this heavy precipitation may extend into the northwestern CONU=
S
later in week-2, but there is not enough confidence to expand the
precipitation
hazard at this time.

...A Heat Wave will encompass much of the West with Record High
Temperatures possible...

...A Strong Cold front will bring the threat of locally Heavy
Rains and Severe Weather from the Upper Mississippi Valley through
the Great Lakes region Monday night into Tuesday...

A mid to upper level ridge is expected to continue to strengthen
across the Great Basin early this week.  This upper ridge will
move only slowly eastward over the next several days, setting the
stage for widespread much above average temperatures across much
of the western U.S. this week.   Heat advisories and Excessive
Heat Warnings are currently in effect across large sections of
California into southern Nevada and northwest Arizona where high
temperatures are forecast to remain above 100 degrees F through
much of this week.  Record high temperatures are possible over the
next two days across portions of the Great Basin into the valleys
of California.  In addition to the heat, there will also be a fire
weather threat across large portions of the west where no
precipitation is expected over the next several days, exacerbating
the the ongoing extreme to exceptional drought conditions.

While the mid to upper level ridge builds across portions of the
west, a mid to upper level trough will be amplifying downstream
across the Great Lakes into the Ohio Valley region.  This will
propel a strong cold front from the Upper Mississippi Valley
Monday night and across the Great Lakes on Tuesday.  An organized
region of thunderstorms are possible along this front, bringing
the threat of locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding and the
risk of severe weather from the Upper Mississippi Valley through
the Great Lakes from Monday night into Tuesday.  In the wake of
this front, cooler than average high temperatures are expected
Tuesday across portions of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi
Valley and Upper Great Lakes region and across all of the Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley into the Upper Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, showery conditions possible along the Gulf coast,
Southeast and Florida, along and to the south of a weakening
frontal boundary across the Southeast.

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Northwest...
As a shortwave trough approaches Tuesday evening, stronger flow
aloft, lift and mid-level moisture will spread inland across
Washington and Oregon. Gusty surface winds may briefly overlap with
dry surface conditions across central and southeastern Oregon where
brief elevated fire weather conditions are possible. Later in the
evening, isolated showers and a few thunderstorms may develop with a
risk for a few lightning strikes across coastal Washington and far
northwestern Oregon. Fast storm speeds and limited moisture content
would favor mostly dry storms. However, storm coverage is expected
to be well below ISODRYT criteria with the brunt of the upper air
forcing remaining well offshore. Elsewhere, the previous forecast
remains valid with no changes.

..Lyons.. 09/06/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CDT Mon Sep 06 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone will persist across the Interior West
tomorrow/Tuesday. As the mid-level trough responsible for fire
weather concerns today moves further out into the central U.S., a
second mid-level trough will impinge on the West Coast late
tomorrow, supporting dry and breezy conditions along and to the lee
of the Coast Ranges in central California. Otherwise, dry and breezy
conditions will remain more localized and confined to
terrain-favoring areas across the Intermountain West by afternoon
peak heating.

...Portions of central California...
By late afternoon into early evening, modest mid-level flow from the
aforementioned trough will overspread central California, where a
dry and well-mixed boundary layer will be in place. Downslope flow
along the lee of the central Coast Ranges into the Bay Area and
parts of the Sacramento/San Joaquin Valleys will promote 15+ mph
sustained west-northwesterly surface winds amid 10-15% RH for at
least a few hours tomorrow. Elevated highlights were introduced
given favorable winds/RH over critically dry fuels, enforced by an
exceptional drought over central California.

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble mean solutions from the ECMWF, G=
EFS, and CMC generally
depict
low amplitude 500-hPa flow across much of the forecast domain. The main
westerlies are forecast near the Canadian border with weak troughs progress=
ing
across the northern CONUS within weakly cyclonic flow. Subtropical ridging =
is
forecast over much of the southern two-thirds of the CONUS, particularly ov=
er
the central CONUS, early in the period. Thereafter, uncertainty increases a=
s
to
the strength and positioning of this ridge. Adding to this uncertainty is t=
hat
the deterministic 6z GFS forecasts a more amplified pattern, bringing a tro=
ugh
to the Great Lakes Region and strong ridging across the western CONUS. This
solution is an outlier but hints at potential instability and increased
uncertainty of the overall pattern. Agreement is better across Alaska early=
 in
the period as models predict a strong closed mid-level low near or just off
the
west coast of Mainland Alaska. Some models, such as the 0z ECMWF Ensemble
mean,
indicate the potential for shortwave energy to progress eastward over the G=
ulf
of Alaska as time progresses. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based primar=
ily
on the dynamical model ensemble mean solutions, depicts near to above norma=
l
heights across most of the CONUS and below normal heights over most of Alas=
ka.

With low amplitude flow expected across the CONUS, above normal temperature=
s
are favored across most of the country. The highest probabilities (exceedin=
g
70
percent) for above normal temperatures are indicated for parts of the Centr=
al
and Southern Plains due to anomalous ridging early in the period. An except=
ion
to the warm pattern is over the northwestern CONUS, where the potential for=
 a
weak trough in the vicinity leads to slightly enhanced probabilities of nea=
r
to
below normal temperatures across the region. Troughing and below normal
heights
are expected across much of Alaska, leading to enhanced probabilities of be=

normal temperatures. However, above normal temperatures are slightly favore=

for the Aleutians due to above normal SSTs in adjacent waters. Milder than

the trough forecast over the eastern Bering Sea.

With a mean trough or closed low forecast over the eastern Bering Sea and t=
he
potential for shortwave troughs progressing eastward over the Gulf of Alask=
a,
an active pattern is anticipated for much of Alaska. Therefore, above norma=
l
precipitation is favored across most of the state. Near to above normal
precipitation is also favored for much of the northern tier of the CONUS ea=
st
of the Rockies due to the potential progression of shortwave troughs within
the
mean westerlies. Chances of above normal precipitation are elevated for the
western Gulf Coast region due to the potential influxes of Gulf moisture.
Predicted mean surface high pressure leads to favored drier than normal
conditions across much of the Southeast. Below normal precipitation is also
favored for the Southwest Monsoon Region as the mean position of the 500-hP=
a
ridge axis is forecast to be located near the CONUS/Mexico border. Dynamica=

model guidance generally favors below normal precipitation for the

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 14 - 20 2021

During the week-2 period, generally low amplitude, weakly cyclonic 500-hPa
flow
is forecast to persist across much of the CONUS. Weak troughs are generally
forecast to progress within the westerlies across the northern tier of the
CONUS early in the period. Thereafter, ensemble mean solutions from the ECM=
WF
and GEFS show some evidence of increased ridging across the east and trough=
ing
over the west later in week-2. An active pattern is expected to continue
across
much of Alaska with troughs predicted over western Mainland Alaska as well =
as
over the Gulf of Alaska. The 500-hPa manual height blend, based entirely on
the
model ensemble mean solutions, depicts near to above normal heights across
most
of the CONUS. A small region of mean below normal heights is indicated over
the
western Gulf Coast Region, associated with a potential tropical disturbance
over the Gulf of Mexico. Below normal heights are forecast across most of
Alaska.

Above normal temperatures are likely for most of the CONUS east of the Rock=
ies
due to predicted low amplitude flow early in the period and the potential f=
or
increased ridging across the east later in the period. Near to below normal
temperatures are generally favored west of the Rockies as increased troughi=
ng
is possible later in week-2. Persistent troughing leads to increased odds f=
or
below normal temperatures across most of southern Alaska. However, above
normal
SSTs leads to elevated chances of above normal temperatures for the Aleutia=
ns.

The potential for advection of tropical moisture leads to increased odds of
above normal precipitation for the western Gulf of Mexico Region. Above nor=
mal
precipitation is also favored for the Great Lakes Region and the interior
Northeast, as shortwave energy progresses through the mean westerlies early=
 in
the period. Farther to the south, the potential for mean surface high press=
ure
leads to slightly elevated odds of below normal precipitation for parts of =
the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic States. Below normal precipitation is likely for
the
Southwest, as the mean position of the subtropical ridge is expected to rem=
ain
in an unfavorable position for an enhanced monsoon. Conversely, an active
pattern is forecast to persist for much of Alaska, leading to enhanced
probabilities of above normal precipitation for the Aleutians, the South Co=
ast
of Mainland Alaska, and the Panhandle. As enhanced Pacific flow pushes
southward, chances of above normal precipitation are forecast to increase f=

cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

415 PM EDT Mon Sep 06 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Sep 09 2021 - 12Z Mon Sep 13 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin Thursday with an upper high
over the Four Corners region and mid-upper troughing across the
eastern third of the country. The upper high is forecast to weaken
and shift/expand eastward toward the Southern Plains/Lower
Mississippi Valley through the period and allow for quasi-zonal
flow to take hold across much of the CONUS, suggesting lower
confidence in system timing/details. The pattern remains rather
dry with generally near to above normal temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Model guidance aligned pretty well for the early part of the
medium range period with the pattern described above. However, by
late week as the pattern deamplifies fairly quickly, several
features will contribute to forecast uncertainty and cause timing
and amplitude differences particularly with shortwaves moving
through the quasi-zonal flow. These include variations with flow
out of the Pacific, differences in positioning and strength of
troughing across Canada, and the manner in which the broad-scale
flow interacts with what is currently Hurricane Larry as it
transitions to an extratropical cyclone. Run-to-run continuity is
also poor, leading to added uncertainty. However, the overall
pattern appears to be handled reasonably well by the GEFS and EC
ensemble means, though confidence in the smaller-scale details is
low. Through Friday, a multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z
models was able to be used (that guidance happened to be fairly
agreeable on a shortwave moving through southwestern Canada into
the north-central U.S., though the 06Z GFS had different timing),
but the forecast shifted to a blend mainly of the ensemble means
by early next week to reduce the effects of the variations in the
deterministic models.

In terms of possible tropical development, a tropical system is
likely to form in the East Pacific per the National Hurricane
Center but is forecast to track offshore/west of Baja California.
In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but moisture
transport northward/northeastward continues to look likely into
the northern/northeastern Gulf later this week, so maintained a
modest QPF signal across the FL Panhandle northeastward, but
ultimately need to wait and see if any organization will occur.
Please see the NHC outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front along much of
I-95 Thursday morning, with its tail-end lingering over the
Southeast for a few days before dissipating. Amounts should
generally be light except over the northeastern Gulf and western
Atlantic coasts (FL/GA/Carolinas), where tropical moisture may
support modest to perhaps locally heavier amounts. Daily
showers/storms are likely for much of the FL peninsula to the
south of the boundary. Some moisture will work back through the
Southwest around the upper high as it drifts southeastward,
focused over inland CA (Sierra) into the Great Basin and parts of
the Desert Southwest. This may lift northward into the northern
Rockies by later in the week into the weekend, ahead of another
Pacific front. These amounts should be generally light as well.
With shortwaves and frontal systems traversing across the
north-central to northeastern U.S., periods of rain showers can be
expected there. By around Monday, another possible low pressure
system with tropical moisture inflow could spread rain toward
western parts of the Gulf Coast, but uncertainty remains high.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially over the Rockies and High Plains ahead of the incoming
Pacific front/trough Thu-Fri. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above
normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into the
southern/central Plains later in the week into the weekend and
toward the Middle Mississippi Valley next week. Temperatures in
the Great Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via
northwest flow behind the cold front later this week, moderating a
bit over the weekend as the surface high settles over the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough across the northern Plains will continue to
amplify while advancing towards the Mississippi Valley today. Still,
a wide corridor of 50+ kt 500 mb northwesterly flow will trail the
departing mid-level trough and overspread the northern High Plains
during the afternoon. Dry and breezy conditions supporting some
wildfire-spread potential are expected. Meanwhile, an upper
ridge/anticyclone will persist across the Interior West, with a
second mid-level trough pivoting around the ridge and grazing the
California coast by late afternoon. The surface mass response will
be downslope flow along the lee of the central Coast Ranges, with
dry and breezy surface conditions promoting modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Northern High Plains...
Boundary-layer mixing of the stronger mid-level flow aloft will
promote widespread 20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
amid 20-25% RH per latest guidance consensus. Elevated highlights
were introduced given forecast fuel ERCs above 80%. Some of the
highlighted areas have seen over an inch of rain within the past
week. However, multiple preceding days of dry and windy conditions
have likely compensated by priming fuels to some degree to support
wildfire spread.

...Portions of central California...
By late afternoon and early evening, upper support associated with
the glancing mid-level trough will overspread the central Coast
Ranges, inducing dry downslope flow in proximity to the Bay Area and
portions of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys. Guidance
consensus continues to portray 15-20 mph sustained
west-northwesterly winds coinciding with 15-20% RH over critically
dry fuels for at least a few hours, warranting the maintenance of
Elevated highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 AM CDT Tue Sep 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will remain in place through tomorrow/Wednesday across
the Interior West, with multiple mid-level impulses cresting the
upper ridge axis over the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies
through the day. Dry and breezy conditions are expected to manifest
across the higher terrain over portions of the Pacific Northwest
into the northern Rockies, promoting at least modest wildfire-spread
potential.

...Pacific Northwest into the Northern Rockies...
As 30-50 kts of mid-level flow overspread the southern Cascades in
Oregon and the Sawtooth Range/Salmon River Mountains in Idaho, 15-20
mph sustained westerly downslope flow is expected to overlap with
15-20% surface RH during the afternoon. While some questions remain
regarding the coverage of 15-20 mph sustained surface winds, fuels
remain critically dry on a widespread basis across parts of the
Pacific Northwest towards the Northern Rockies. Elevated highlights
were added where the most persistent downslope flow is expected
based on guidance consensus.

...Overview...

The medium range period will feature a trend toward quasi-zonal
flow as an upper high over the Four Corners region weakens into
the southern Plains and Southeast. Troughing will reload over the
Northeast as a couple systems traverse the U.S./Canadian border.
The pattern remains rather dry with generally near to above normal
temperatures.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles showed decent longwave agreement with much
more spread in the shorter wavelength features. Perhaps the ECMWF
has been more consistent than the GFS or Canadian/UKMET, but even
it has wavered in how it handles the Pacific flow across the
CONUS. Thus, continued to favor a blended solution of the recent
deterministic guidance to start, with increasing weight to the
ensemble means (GEFS and ECMWF EPS) by the end of the period as
uncertainty continues to grow. Trend has been toward a deeper
trough in the northern Rockies early next week, but the east-west
(fast-slow) spread continues, with the GFS quickest and Canadian
slowest. This left the ECMWF mostly in between nearer to the
ensemble means.

Per the latest NHC outlooks, a tropical system is likely to form
in the East Pacific over the next day or so but is forecast to
track offshore/west of Baja California. In the Gulf of Mexico,
tropical development remains uncertain but by the medium range it
could be on its way out into the Atlantic. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus along and ahead of a cold front (perhaps fused
with some additional tropical moisture) into the Deep South and
Florida to start the period. Daily showers/storms are likely for
much of the FL peninsula to the south of the boundary as it washes
out. Some moisture will lift northward on the backside of the
upper high into the northern Rockies, with generally light
amounts. With shortwaves and frontal systems traversing across the
north-central to northeastern U.S., periods of rain showers can be
expected there. By around next Monday, tropical moisture could
spread some organized rain toward western parts of the Gulf Coast
(including south Texas), but uncertainty remains high.

Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially over the Front Range  on Friday with highs 10-20
degrees above normal. This area of warmth will move into the
southern/central Plains over the weekend and toward the Middle
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys next week. Temperatures in the Great
Lakes/Northeast will be near to a bit below normal via northwest
flow behind the cold front Friday, moderating a bit over the
weekend as the surface high settles over the region. The next cold
front may bring in another shot of slightly cooler than normal
temperatures across the northern tier next Mon-Tue.

...A heat wave will encompass much of the West with record high
temperatures possible...

...A strong cold front will bring the threat of locally heavy
rains and severe weather across the Great Lakes through tonight...

A mid- to upper-level ridge is expected to strengthen and expand
its influence across the western U.S. during the next few days,
setting the stage for widespread much above average temperatures
across the region.  Heat advisories are currently in effect across
large sections of California while Excessive Heat Warnings are in
effect for the Mojave Desert.  High temperatures are forecast to
remain above 100 degrees for the next couple of days, with 120
degrees possible in Death Valley.  Record high temperatures are
possible in the interior valleys of California, across portions of
the Great Basin, spreading into the central High Plains on
Thursday.  In addition to the heat, there will also be a fire
weather threat across large portions of the west where no
precipitation is expected over the next several days, which will
exacerbate the ongoing extreme to exceptional drought conditions.

As the ridge builds across portions of the west, a mid- to
upper-level trough will be amplifying downstream over the Great
Lakes and into the Ohio Valley.  This will propel a strong cold
front through the Great Lakes today.  Organized thunderstorms are
anticipated ahead of and along this front, bringing the threat of
locally heavy rains, isolated flash flooding and the risk of
severe weather through the central Great Lakes today before
reaching the lower Great Lakes later tonight.  On Wednesday, much
of the East Coast will see an increasing chance of thunderstorms
especially later in the afternoon into the evening as the cold
front pushes steadily through the region.  By Thursday morning,
the best chance of showers and storms will be across eastern New
England ahead of the front while drier air will begin to filter
into the Mid-Atlantic behind the front.  In the wake of this cold
front, cooler than average high temperatures are expected to
overspread the northern Plains, upper Mississippi Valley and upper
Great Lakes region today, and then across all of the Great Lakes,
Ohio Valley into the Upper Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

Elsewhere, showery conditions can be expected along the Gulf
coast, Southeast and Florida, along and to the south of a
weakening frontal boundary across the Southeast.  Some increase of
thunderstorm activity is possible near the eastern Gulf Coast on
Wednesday as a modest amount of moisture associated with a
tropical wave could be drawn northward from over the Gulf of
Mexico.

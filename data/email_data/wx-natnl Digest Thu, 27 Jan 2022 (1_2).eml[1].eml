NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0919 AM CST Wed Jan 26 2022

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Morning surface observations and trends in latest guidance continue
to suggest low fire weather potential for today across the CONUS.
Dry and locally breezy conditions remain possible across the lower
CO River Valley and coastal southern CA, but fuels remain too
limited to support a more robust concern. See the discussion below
for additional details.

..Moore.. 01/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CST Wed Jan 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
Flow aloft will become broadly cyclonic across a sizable portion of
the country today. At the surface, high pressure will be present in
the West and from the Gulf Coast into the Northeast. A strong
surface cyclone in southern Canada will move eastward north of the
international border, bringing gusty winds to parts of the northern
Plains and upper Midwest. Fire weather concerns will remain minimal
due to a combination of cool/cold conditions and unreceptive fuels.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

Early in the medium range period from Saturday into early Sunday,
a deep upper trough reaching the East Coast will likely close off
an embedded upper low that tracks near the New England coast. The
evolution aloft will support further deepening of strong low
pressure just off the East Coast and direct the system northward,
from east of the Mid-Atlantic coast into the Canadian Maritimes.
This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region with higher confidence for heavy snow over the
Northeast, where high winds and coastal impacts are also likely
through the weekend. At the same time a weak eastern Pacific
trough/upper low will cut through the southern part of initial
ridging over the West. From late weekend into next week a more
potent upper trough will push into the West and steadily amplify,
ultimately flipping the upper pattern as a ridge axis reaches the
East Coast by Wednesday. This configuration should lead to a
pronounced increase of precipitation over the central U.S. by the
end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the most recent couple of cycles continues to
show a rapidly deepening (bomb) cyclone in the western Atlantic
over the weekend, but continues to waffle somewhat with its exact
track, and the relatively fine-scale wobbles can cause notably
different weather impacts. Latest guidance continues to favor an
intermediate/consensus approach for depicting the western Atlantic
storm during the weekend. A significant key to the forecast of the
surface low by late Saturday appears to be exactly when, where,
and how deeply the upper low within the overall trough closes off.
ECMWF runs have been reasonably persistent on the earlier/deeper
side with GFS runs at little later/weaker. Overall the forecast
position for the low on Saturday and Sunday was very similar to
the previous WPC forecast issuance, per the 00Z/06Z model
consensus and taking somewhat of an average position between the
slightly slower EC other faster models. However, incoming 12Z
guidance has shown a slightly eastward/more offshore trend
particularly on Saturday.

Models continue to improve their agreement with the small upper
trough/low moving from the Pacific into the Southwest over the
weekend and the Southern Plains early Monday before weakening as
it heads into a developing mean ridge in the East. However, more
model differences arise with the deeper upstream troughing
expected to dig during the first half of next week in the West.
The general trend in the 00Z/06Z model guidance was a slightly
faster trough axis moving eastward especially by
Tuesday-Wednesday, which pushed the cold front ahead of it faster
than the previous forecast. There is still considerable
uncertainty with the multiple pieces of energy serving to
create/dig this trough, which mainly stem from high
latitude/Pacific regions with low predictability. Of the 00Z model
cycle, the CMC showed some stream separation producing a southern
stream low diving off the coast of California Monday-Tuesday
unlike other guidance. This appeared to be somewhat of an outlier
based on consensus and most individual ensemble members, but the
new 12Z GFS ended up looking quite similar to that 00Z CMC, while
the 12Z CMC ended up without this pattern, closing off a southern
stream low well west in the Pacific as did the incoming 12Z ECMWF.
This is just an indication that though model guidance may indicate
agreement at times, there is still low confidence in the details,
and the forecast still may go through changes with the trough axis
and frontal timing.

A multi-model deterministic blend was used early in the medium
range forecast period, with the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and the 00Z
ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET. Gradually increased the incorporation of
the GEFS and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the
period given increasing model differences and uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

To start the period Saturday, heavy snow is likely across the
Northeast with possibly some snow lingering in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region. Latest forecasts show the highest confidence
in heavy snow amounts likely near coastal New England. Significant
coastal impacts are possible in the Northeast, including coastal
flooding and beach erosion. Additionally, strong winds may cause
blowing snow and some damage. Hazardous travel conditions are
likely in parts of the region. See the WPC website for updated Key

It still appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend may be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region. Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Over the past day guidance has started to
show some convergence toward the idea of at least some meaningful
rainfall along and north of the western half of the Gulf Coast by
Monday. Moisture ahead of a northeastern Pacific upper trough
should begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then
continue to spread across more of the West with time as the upper
trough moves inland and amplifies. Highest totals of rain/mountain
snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but amounts do not
appear too significant at this time. Toward midweek the western
trough and leading surface front will interact with a healthy flow
of Gulf moisture to produce a rapidly expanding area of
precipitation, some of it potentially becoming moderate to heavy
in the south-central U.S. Lighter wintry precipitation will be
possible over northern latitudes. A series of waves/fronts may
bring episodes of light and scattered snow into parts of the Great
Lakes before the larger scale pattern changes.

The eastern U.S. will be quite chilly through the weekend with
broad coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal, including
subfreezing lows extending into portions of Florida. Areas from
the Mississippi Valley to Appalachians should see a moderating
trend from west to east. Aside from some below average readings
over Texas and vicinity, much of the Plains will see above average
temperatures from the weekend into next week with readings up to
10-20F or so above normal, locally higher. This warmth will
progress into the eastern half of the country early-mid week with
the increase of Gulf moisture helping to raise min temperature
anomalies in particular by Wednesday. Moderately above average
temperatures over the West during the weekend will trend lower
next week with the arrival of an amplifying upper trough, and
5-15F below normal highs may extend from the Interior West into
the High Plains/northern tier by Tuesday-Wednesday.

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

Early in the medium range period from Saturday into early Sunday,
a deep upper trough reaching the East Coast will likely close off
an embedded upper low that tracks near the New England coast. The
evolution aloft will support further deepening of strong low
pressure just off the East Coast and direct the system northward,
from east of the Mid-Atlantic coast into the Canadian Maritimes.
This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region with higher confidence for heavy snow over the
Northeast, where high winds and coastal impacts are also likely
through the weekend. At the same time a weak eastern Pacific
trough/upper low will cut through the southern part of initial
ridging over the West. From late weekend into next week a more
potent upper trough will push into the West and steadily amplify,
ultimately flipping the upper pattern as a ridge axis reaches the
East Coast by Wednesday. This configuration should lead to a
pronounced increase of precipitation over the central U.S. by the
end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the most recent couple of cycles continues to
show a rapidly deepening (bomb) cyclone in the western Atlantic
over the weekend, but continues to waffle somewhat with its exact
track, and the relatively fine-scale wobbles can cause notably
different weather impacts. Latest guidance continues to favor an
intermediate/consensus approach for depicting the western Atlantic
storm during the weekend. A significant key to the forecast of the
surface low by late Saturday appears to be exactly when, where,
and how deeply the upper low within the overall trough closes off.
ECMWF runs have been reasonably persistent on the earlier/deeper
side with GFS runs at little later/weaker. Overall the forecast
position for the low on Saturday and Sunday was very similar to
the previous WPC forecast issuance, per the 00Z/06Z model
consensus and taking somewhat of an average position between the
slightly slower EC other faster models. However, incoming 12Z
guidance has shown a slightly eastward/more offshore trend
particularly on Saturday.

Models continue to improve their agreement with the small upper
trough/low moving from the Pacific into the Southwest over the
weekend and the Southern Plains early Monday before weakening as
it heads into a developing mean ridge in the East. However, more
model differences arise with the deeper upstream troughing
expected to dig during the first half of next week in the West.
The general trend in the 00Z/06Z model guidance was a slightly
faster trough axis moving eastward especially by
Tuesday-Wednesday, which pushed the cold front ahead of it faster
than the previous forecast. There is still considerable
uncertainty with the multiple pieces of energy serving to
create/dig this trough, which mainly stem from high
latitude/Pacific regions with low predictability. Of the 00Z model
cycle, the CMC showed some stream separation producing a southern
stream low diving off the coast of California Monday-Tuesday
unlike other guidance. This appeared to be somewhat of an outlier
based on consensus and most individual ensemble members, but the
new 12Z GFS ended up looking quite similar to that 00Z CMC, while
the 12Z CMC ended up without this pattern, closing off a southern
stream low well west in the Pacific as did the incoming 12Z ECMWF.
This is just an indication that though model guidance may indicate
agreement at times, there is still low confidence in the details,
and the forecast still may go through changes with the trough axis
and frontal timing.

A multi-model deterministic blend was used early in the medium
range forecast period, with the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and the 00Z
ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET. Gradually increased the incorporation of
the GEFS and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the
period given increasing model differences and uncertainty.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes needed. Latest model guidance continues to show
low fire weather potential outside of the Southwest (see the
previous discussion below for more details on this regional
concern).

..Moore.. 01/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0122 AM CST Wed Jan 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level troughing will intensify on Thursday across from the
Plains to the East Coast. As this occurs, another surface high
pressure system will reinforce cold air across much of the Plains
and upper Midwest. In the West, an upper ridge will amplify across
the Great Basin, strengthening the surface anticyclone within the
region. Cool/cold conditions, precipitation, and generally light
winds will keep fire weather concerns minimal in most locations. The
surface pattern will again favor northerly/northeasterly winds in
southern California and the lower Colorado River Valley. Though RH
will fall to perhaps below 15%, live and dead fuel moisture remains
high enough to keep fire concerns low in these areas as well.

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 03 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 09: Compared to previous
guidance, dynamical models have come into better agreement during the early
portion of week-2. Ensemble mean height forecasts from the 0z GEFS and 0z
ECMWF
show anomalous 500-hPa ridging over the eastern Pacific, with downstream fu=
ll
latitude troughing over much of the western and central CONUS by the outset=
 of
the period. Beyond this time, however, the ECMWF continues to be more
progressive than the GEFS with the mid-level height pattern, featuring the
development of positive height departures overspreading the western CONUS,
with
much of the mid-level troughing shifting eastward and weakening with time.
Similar to yesterday, the GEFS continues to depict a predominantly stable a=
nd
more amplified mid-level pattern throughout week-2. Given these differences=
 in
the evolving height pattern, there continues to be increased uncertainty in
the
hazards outlook beyond the first few days of the period over the CONUS.



Late in week-1, anomalously cold air is forecast to be in place over the
higher
elevations of the West and across many portions of the Great Plains tied to
the
anomalous troughing favored aloft. Since yesterday, the ECMWF has come into
better agreement with the GEFS favoring large negative 850-hPa temperature
departures overspreading this part of the country and persisting into early
week-2. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for much =
of
the western and central CONUS (except California and the Pacific Northwest)
for
Feb 3 to 4, where there is agreement in the reforecast tools indicating a
broad
region with at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the
15th percentile. Higher probabilities (>40%) are featured in both reforecas=
t
tools supporting the addition of two moderate risk areas, one focused over =
the
Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, and the other located further
south in the Southern and Central High Plains for Feb 3. There is agreement=
 in
these tools depicting at least a 40% chance for minimum temperatures fallin=
g
below 0 and 28 degrees F in the former and latter regions, respectively.
Beyond
day 9 (Feb 4), the GEFS reforecast tool favors a more prolonged cold signal=
,
however the departing mid-level trough and building heights aloft favored i=
n
the ECMWF ensemble over the Plains adds to uncertainty at this lead,
precluding
the continuation of the corresponding temperature hazards later in week-2.



Farther east, deterministic and ensemble mean solutions from both the 0z GE=
FS
and 0z ECMWF continue to favor a surface low tracking northeastward from th=
e
Great Lakes into the Northeast early in the period. There is continued
agreement with a synoptic return flow setup, favorable for the advection of
Gulf moisture and potentially heavy precipitation over parts of the eastern
CONUS. Although calibrated reforecast guidance keeps much of the heavy
precipitation potential confined along the eastern seaboard, uncalibrated
guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF continue to show elevated mean precipitati=
on
amounts further west into the Mississippi Valley. To capture this potential=
, a
slight risk of heavy precipitation remains issued from Feb 3 to 4 extending
from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic. Cold air advection
remains likely on the backside the surface low moving across the northeaste=
rn
CONUS, and a slight risk of heavy snow is issued from the western Great Lak=
es
and the Ohio Valley into portions of the Northeast from Feb 3 to 4. Mixed
precipitation is possible along the southern periphery of the highlighted a=
rea
as depicted in some of the latest deterministic solutions. Relative to the
previous outlook, a slight risk of high winds is removed in the today's
outlook
due to less support from the GEFS ensemble mean surface pressure fields and
the
GEFS reforecast tool.



Over Alaska, a trough/ridge pattern forecast over the northern Pacific favo=
rs
increased onshore flow to promote above-normal precipitation throughout muc=
h
of
the state. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate increased chan=
ces
for 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile across portion=
s
of
the southeastern Mainland and Panhandle, and a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted over the region early in the period. The increase i=
n
moisture also increases the potential for heavy snowfall over the higher
elevations, prompting the addition of a slight risk of heavy snow covering =
the
southeastern Mainland through the Panhandle for Feb 3 to 5.

...Bitter cold across much of the Northeast tonight before the
next surge of arctic air enters the Upper Midwest on Thursday...

...Snow showers to traverse the Great Lakes and Central
Rockies/High Plains on Thursday near an approaching cold front...

...An area of light snow is forecast to develop over the
Mid-Atlantic and Central Appalachians by Friday afternoon as a
coastal storm begins to organize off the Southeast Coast...

Under an area of high pressure, much of the Northeast and northern
sections of the Mid-Atlantic will be in for another cold night and
start to the day on Thursday. Lows are forecast to dip below zero
and into the single digits for most locations, with teens found
farther south into the Tennessee Valley and southern Virginia.
Temperatures will also start below average across parts of the
Lower Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains, where subfreezing
lows are likely. Outside of the Southern Plains, these
temperatures are expected to warm slightly by the end of the week
as the aforementioned area of high pressure weakens and slides off
the East Coast. Meanwhile, the next shot of arctic air is lined up
and expected to drop out of south-central Canada on Thursday. This
will lead to below average temperatures throughout the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes on Friday.

This arctic cold front will also be responsible for scattered snow
showers between Thursday and Thursday night across the Great
Lakes. Light snow may impact parts of the Central Rockies and
Central High Plains during this time frame as well, thanks to a
potent upper-level disturbance crossing the region. However,
minimal snow accumulations are forecast. This same upper-level
disturbance is forecast to round the base of a trough located over
the eastern U.S. and spawn a developing coastal storm east of the
Carolinas by Friday night. Light snow may break out across the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic by Friday afternoon, leading
to minor snow accumulations. The majority of the impacts
associated with this upcoming winter storm will likely occur after
Friday night.

Elsewhere, chances for scattered showers and thunderstorms will
continue for southern Florida as a stationary boundary linger
overs this section of the country. Light rain may also dampen
southern Texas on Friday as a fast-moving cold front progresses
into northern Mexico to end the week.

Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above normal
temperatures are likely for the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Panhandle, and
southwestern Mainland Alaska associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.
Troughing over the central CONUS favors elevated probabilities for below-
normal
temperatures over the western and most of the central CONUS. Conversely,
ridging and above-normal 500-hPa heights over the eastern CONUS lead to
increased chances of above-normal temperatures there.

Mean southwesterly flow leads to increased chances of above-normal
precipitation over much of Alaska. The potential for enhanced offshore flow
increases chances of below-normal precipitation for parts of the western
CONUS.
Above-normal precipitation is favored over much of the central and eastern

The week-2 manual blend of model 500-hPa forecasts is generally similar to =
the
6-10 day period. However, predicted 500-hPa height anomalies are less
amplified
than in the 6-10 day period blend, as uncertainty among the model forecasts
increases. Ridging persists for the Gulf Alaska and western CONUS into the
week
2 period, with downstream troughing progressing slightly eastward in week 2
relative to the 6-10 day period.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for northern Mainland Alaska
for
week-2, under continued anomalous northwesterly flow. Above normal
temperatures
are favored over southern Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and Alaska Panhan=

...Coastal winter storm threat from the Mid-Atlantic to especially
New England Friday into the weekend...


...Overview...

Early in the medium range period from Saturday into early Sunday,
a deep upper trough reaching the East Coast will likely close off
an embedded upper low that tracks near the New England coast. The
evolution aloft will support further deepening of strong low
pressure just off the East Coast and direct the system northward,
from east of the Mid-Atlantic coast into the Canadian Maritimes.
This strong coastal storm may cause heavy snow in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region with higher confidence for heavy snow over the
Northeast, where high winds and coastal impacts are also likely
through the weekend. At the same time a weak eastern Pacific
trough/upper low will cut through the southern part of initial
ridging over the West. From late weekend into next week a more
potent upper trough will push into the West and steadily amplify,
ultimately flipping the upper pattern as a ridge axis reaches the
East Coast by Wednesday. This configuration should lead to a
pronounced increase of precipitation over the central U.S. by the
end of the forecast period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance for the most recent couple of cycles continues to
show a rapidly deepening (bomb) cyclone in the western Atlantic
over the weekend, but continues to waffle somewhat with its exact
track, and the relatively fine-scale wobbles can cause notably
different weather impacts. Latest guidance continues to favor an
intermediate/consensus approach for depicting the western Atlantic
storm during the weekend. A significant key to the forecast of the
surface low by late Saturday appears to be exactly when, where,
and how deeply the upper low within the overall trough closes off.
ECMWF runs have been reasonably persistent on the earlier/deeper
side with GFS runs at little later/weaker. Overall the forecast
position for the low on Saturday and Sunday was very similar to
the previous WPC forecast issuance, per the 00Z/06Z model
consensus and taking somewhat of an average position between the
slightly slower EC other faster models. However, incoming 12Z
guidance has shown a slightly eastward/more offshore trend
particularly on Saturday.

Models continue to improve their agreement with the small upper
trough/low moving from the Pacific into the Southwest over the
weekend and the Southern Plains early Monday before weakening as
it heads into a developing mean ridge in the East. However, more
model differences arise with the deeper upstream troughing
expected to dig during the first half of next week in the West.
The general trend in the 00Z/06Z model guidance was a slightly
faster trough axis moving eastward especially by
Tuesday-Wednesday, which pushed the cold front ahead of it faster
than the previous forecast. There is still considerable
uncertainty with the multiple pieces of energy serving to
create/dig this trough, which mainly stem from high
latitude/Pacific regions with low predictability. Of the 00Z model
cycle, the CMC showed some stream separation producing a southern
stream low diving off the coast of California Monday-Tuesday
unlike other guidance. This appeared to be somewhat of an outlier
based on consensus and most individual ensemble members, but the
new 12Z GFS ended up looking quite similar to that 00Z CMC, while
the 12Z CMC ended up without this pattern, closing off a southern
stream low well west in the Pacific as did the incoming 12Z ECMWF.
This is just an indication that though model guidance may indicate
agreement at times, there is still low confidence in the details,
and the forecast still may go through changes with the trough axis
and frontal timing.

A multi-model deterministic blend was used early in the medium
range forecast period, with the 00Z/06Z GFS runs and the 00Z
ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET. Gradually increased the incorporation of
the GEFS and EC ensemble means to about half by the end of the
period given increasing model differences and uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

To start the period Saturday, heavy snow is likely across the
Northeast with possibly some snow lingering in the coastal
Mid-Atlantic region. Latest forecasts show the highest confidence
in heavy snow amounts likely near coastal New England. Significant
coastal impacts are possible in the Northeast, including coastal
flooding and beach erosion. Additionally, strong winds may cause
blowing snow and some damage. Hazardous travel conditions are
likely in parts of the region. See the WPC website for updated Key
Messages on the system and check your local forecast at

HQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

It still appears that the upper trough/low that may track into
California and the Southwest this weekend may be weak enough not
to produce much if any precipitation over that region. Its
strength and track thereafter will determine how much
precipitation may develop from the Gulf Coast northward by the
first part of next week. Over the past day guidance has started to
show some convergence toward the idea of at least some meaningful
rainfall along and north of the western half of the Gulf Coast by
Monday. Moisture ahead of a northeastern Pacific upper trough
should begin to move into the Northwest on Sunday and then
continue to spread across more of the West with time as the upper
trough moves inland and amplifies. Highest totals of rain/mountain
snow should be over the Pacific Northwest, but amounts do not
appear too significant at this time. Toward midweek the western
trough and leading surface front will interact with a healthy flow
of Gulf moisture to produce a rapidly expanding area of
precipitation, some of it potentially becoming moderate to heavy
in the south-central U.S. Lighter wintry precipitation will be
possible over northern latitudes. A series of waves/fronts may
bring episodes of light and scattered snow into parts of the Great
Lakes before the larger scale pattern changes.

The eastern U.S. will be quite chilly through the weekend with
broad coverage of temperatures 10-20F below normal, including
subfreezing lows extending into portions of Florida. Areas from
the Mississippi Valley to Appalachians should see a moderating
trend from west to east. Aside from some below average readings
over Texas and vicinity, much of the Plains will see above average
temperatures from the weekend into next week with readings up to
10-20F or so above normal, locally higher. This warmth will
progress into the eastern half of the country early-mid week with
the increase of Gulf moisture helping to raise min temperature
anomalies in particular by Wednesday. Moderately above average
temperatures over the West during the weekend will trend lower
next week with the arrival of an amplifying upper trough, and
5-15F below normal highs may extend from the Interior West into
the High Plains/northern tier by Tuesday-Wednesday.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1233 AM CST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level trough across the central and eastern U.S.
will intensify while an upper-level ridge amplifies along the West
Coast. At the surface, high pressure will build from the Great Basin
into the Plains and the upper Midwest. Colder conditions will
continue across much of the country as a result. The strong high
pressure system in the Great Basin will drive breezy conditions from
southern California into the lower Colorado River Valley. While RH
could drop to around 15% in some locations, fuels remain relatively
moist and are not expected to support significant fire spread.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 AM CST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
For Friday, the eastern upper-level trough is expected to intensify
through the day. The upper-level ridge in the West will
simultaneously broaden. A surface low is forecast to develop in the
Canadian Prairie with a trough extending into the central Plains.
The Great Basin surface high pressure system is expected to maintain
strength.

As has been the case for the past few days, offshore/downslope winds
will continue in southern California and the lower Colorado River
Valley. While fuels have dried some, fuel indices are still around
seasonal normals. Fire weather concerns are still expected to be
low.

In the central/southern Plains, areas of dry and windy conditions
are possible due to the strong high pressure west of the Divide and
the developing trough to the east. There is higher confidence in low
RH in the southern High Plains, but recent snowfall will temper fire
weather concerns there. Portions of western/central Nebraska into
central Kansas could see gusty winds. There is a fair amount of
uncertainty regarding the temperature/RH, however. With some colder
air and possible light snowfall moving in on Thursday, it is unclear
whether the temperatures will be warm enough to support critically
low RH and deeper boundary-layer mixing. With dry fuels in place
across these areas, some locally elevated concerns may develop.
Broader concerns are possible if temperatures end up warmer than
anticipated.

...Coastal winter storm to track away from New England on Sunday...


...Overview...

By the start of the medium range period early Sunday, the deep
system tracking just off the East Coast late this week into the
weekend should reach a position east or northeast of Maine, still
supporting some strong winds even if precipitation tapers off.
This storm will continue moving rapidly away from New England
during the day Sunday. For information on the storm's effects
before early Sunday consult the WPC website for updated Key
Messages and check your local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:=
//weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PM=
Gc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ . Through the
rest of the period the dominant theme will be a significant
pattern change as an upper trough strongly amplifies from the
northeastern Pacific into the western/central U.S. while a strong
ridge builds and then persists over the eastern Pacific while
another ridge crossing the East Coast Tuesday settles over the
western Atlantic thereafter. This evolution will initially spread
precipitation across the West and then likely produce significant
precipitation farther eastward as a leading wavy front interacts
with a strong flow of Gulf moisture. Ahead of the trough, a
southern stream shortwave/upper low may generate some enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

An operational model blend early in the period followed by a
transition toward slightly less than half total weight of 18Z
GEFS/12Z ECMWF means continued to provide a good representation of
consensus ideas with mainly just typical run-to-run detail changes
versus previous cycle. For the storm producing lingering effects
over New England, there are still meaningful differences in the
short range due in part to fine-scale issues with the supporting
upper low so there is still a fair amount of uncertainty over the
exact location/structure of the storm as of early Sunday. Overall
the latest GFS/GEFS mean are on the faster side and the 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean are slowest, conforming to long-historical
tendencies. Meanwhile guidance continues to consolidate for the
handling of the southern stream shortwave/upper low emerging from
the Southwest, with the 00Z UKMET straying faster than most other
solutions. This feature should rapidly shear out beyond the
Plains. Farther west, there are still differences in how some
energy pulls off from the southwestern part of the shortwave
approaching the West Coast Sunday but now with less pronounced
spread than in the past couple cycles. As the larger scale upper
trough digs into the western/central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the
ensemble means and a multi-run average of operational runs suggest
above average predictability for the large-scale feature while
individual members/model runs show embedded detail uncertainties.
Examples of the latter include to what degree flow may separate
near the Four Corners region around Wednesday and the character of
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough by Thursday. The 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF/12Z CMC provided the most appealing operational
components for this trough to go along with the ensemble mean
input. The new 00Z CMC has come in lagging consensus a bit
relative to the better fitting 12Z runs from the past couple days,
though the new 00Z ECMWF has slowed a bit as well.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect strong winds over New England at the start of Sunday to
moderate over the course of the day as strong low pressure tracks
rapidly away from the region. Otherwise the effects of this storm
will be in the short range. See the WPC website for latest Key
Messages on the system and additional information in the
Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion, plus check your
local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA=
!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

The upper trough/low reaching the Southwest by early Sunday should
produce little if any precipitation over that region. However as
the feature continues eastward, there will be some potential for
locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas across parts
of the Gulf Coast region during the first half of the week. Best
potential at this time appears to be over eastern Texas with lower
confidence in details farther east. Some aspects of this event may
hinge on small-scale details not easily resolved very far in
advance. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Sunday-Tuesday will spread moderate amounts of rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward and
southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest totals are likely
to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be too extreme. In
general the forecast remains on track for a significant increase
of coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central
U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading wavy front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best potential for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Wintry weather
will be possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield,
with at least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details in the colder air may be more dependent on
lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave energy and frontal
waves.

Cold conditions near the East Coast will extend through Sunday
with many areas 10-20F below normal. Subfreezing lows should
extend into portions of Florida and parts of the Florida Peninsula
may challenge daily records for both morning lows and daytime
highs. Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures
Sunday into the first part of next work week, with some
northern/central areas possibly seeing plus 20F or greater
anomalies on one or two days. This warm air will progress into the
eastern half of the country Tuesday-Thursday, bringing a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal and perhaps greater
anomalies for lows over the Northeast by Thursday. Also during
Tuesday-Thursday much of the West and then into the Plains will
see an episode of chilly temperatures with the Rockies and Plains
seeing the best potential for readings 10-20F below normal.

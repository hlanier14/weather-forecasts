Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

The Elevated area has been expanded slightly northward into
south-central/southeast CO based on the latest short-term guidance,
but otherwise no changes have been made. See the previous discussion
below for more details.

..Dean.. 10/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will approach the Plains states today, fostering
the intensification of a surface low and associated strong, dry
westerly winds across the southern High Plains. 15-20 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds will coincide with 15-25% RH across
portions of eastern New Mexico into extreme southern Colorado and
portions of the Oklahoma/Texas Panhandles this afternoon. Given
preceding dry conditions across the southern High Plains,
grass-based fuels should be at least marginally receptive to fire
spread, warranting the maintenance of Elevated highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0125 PM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

No changes have been made to the outlook. See the previous
discussion below for more details.

..Dean.. 10/23/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Sat Oct 23 2021/

...Synopsis...
As a coupled mid-level trough and surface low progress to the east
towards the Missouri Valley tomorrow afternoon, dry and breezy
conditions are expected to accompany the post-dryline environment
across the southern High Plains. Several guidance members depict
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20% RH
immediately behind the dryline, likely lasting for at least a few
hours around afternoon peak heating. Given the lack of recent or
forecast precipitation, along with multiple preceding days of
dry/breezy conditions, finer fuels should remain at least marginally
receptive to fire spread. Elevated highlights have been introduced
where guidance agreement is strongest in placing the dry/windy
post-dryline environment, and where the greatest fuels receptiveness
is expected.

...A highly stormy pattern continues across our Nation next week...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The weather patern will remain quite active as potent systems
impact the nation next week. Guidance has trended less
progressive/more amplified with these systems.

An upper low developing over the lower Great Lakes Tuesday as
northern and southern stream energies phase will induce a
deepening cyclone with heavy wrap-around winds/rainfall and
flooding threats over the Northeast U.S. Guidance is now in better
agreement with this scenario and a well organized coastal storm is
expected to track toward the Canadian maritimes by Thursday.
Predictability with this feature is above average.

Meanwhile upstream, yet another potent trough will eject out of
the West/Rockies Tuesday-Wednesday. Guidance has swerved a bit and
now shows more separated flow with possible development of a
southern stream closed low and deeper surface low/frontal midweek
that offers a slowed and southward separated track from the
southern Plains to the Mid-Atlantic into next Saturday. Organized
moisture and rainfall will wrap around the low and accompany a
leading frontal system with rounds of heavy rainfall possible and
also offers a threat for runoff issues. Predictability with this
feature is less than average, but spread has decreased some in 12
UTC guidance.

Well upstream, a favorable jet and onshore track of shortwaves
pattern will also meanwhile fast track move into the Pacific
Northwest during the period to bring more heavy rain/mountain
snows to the Northwest that increasing run overtop lead/warming
upper ridge development underneath over the rest of the West
through late week.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of best clustered guidance from the 06 UTC GEFS
mean and 00 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble means, with emphasis
attributed to the GEFS mean into days 6/7 (next Friday/Saturday).
Growing forecast spread favors an ensemble mean focus and the GEFS
more separated stream flow and amplitude/slowed progression with
the main storms better fit latest guidance trends from recent
guidance including the newer 12 UTC runs.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The leading closed low into the Northeast on Tuesday will allow
for heavy rainfall potential to continue from the end of the short
range period into much of New England early next week. Deepening
coastal low development may induce pockets of enhanced rainfall on
the backside of the low as it lifts northward towards the Canadian
Maritimes.

The cold front reaching the Plains by Tuesday and onward into the
east-central U.S. Wednesday/Thursday is expected to present an
emerging and expanding lead rainfall/convective focus as ample
Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic moisture streams into the system.
Latest guidance suggests the best potential for heavy rainfall
will be across portions of the Gulf Coast states/Southeast and
inland Wednesday into Thursday and then into the Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Thursday-Saturday with
closed upper low development and a slowed frontal system
progression. The Storm Prediction Center also is highlighting the
potential for severe weather across parts of the central/southern
Plains on Tuesday, and the central Gulf Coast on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, out west, a sustained moisture plume from the short
range period will continue into the Northwest U.S. on Tuesday
bringing a continued threat for heavy rainfall and mountain snows
to especially the Pacific Northwest/northern California but also
farther inland across the northern Rockies. Another system moving
towards the coast mid-later next week will continue the active
weather with another round of heavy rainfall and mountain snow
impacting parts of the Pacific Northwest.

423 PM EDT Sat Oct 23 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Oct 24 2021 - 00Z Tue Oct 26 2021

...There is a High Risk of excessive rainfall over the Sierra
Nevada Mountains and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over the
Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys on Sunday into Monday
morning...

...Heavy snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountains...

...There is a Slight Risk severe thunderstorms over the Central
Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through Sunday morning...

A strong storm in the Eastern Pacific will impact the West Coast
over the next several days.  On Sunday, the associated front moves
into the West Coast, advancing inland to the Northern High Plains
to the Great Basin/Southern California by Monday evening. Moisture
will stream into Central/Northern California overnight Saturday,
turning into a powerful stream of moisture on Sunday.  On Monday,
the moisture stream will move southward along the coast while
weakening. There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall through
Sunday morning. As the moisture stream increases, WPC has issued a
High Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains on Sunday into Monday morning.  With the High Risk,
significant, and potentially life threatening flash flooding is
expected.

On Monday, the excessive rainfall threat lessens to a Slight Risk
over parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains with a Marginal Risk
over other parts of the Sierra Nevada Mountains and parts of the
Southern California Coast from Monday into Monday night.  Heavy
snow will develop over the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada
Mountains on Monday as the front moves pass by.  Furthermore, on
Monday, spotty snow will develop over parts of the Cascades and
the Northern Intermountain Region Rockies.

Meanwhile, an area of low pressure over the Central Plains and
associated front will interact with moisture flowing northward
over the Plains/Mississippi Valley to produce showers and
thunderstorms over the region overnight Saturday into Sunday
morning, with some storms becoming severe.  Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts over the
Central Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through Sunday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a
minimal threat for tornadoes. The low and associated front marches
eastward to the Lower Great Lakes. The trailing boundary extends
across the Mid-Atlantic into the Southeast, then westward to the
Southern Plains by Monday evening. As a result, the risk for
severe thunderstorms moves eastward, with the front impacting the
Middle Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday into Monday morning and
into the Mid-Atlantic and the Central/Southern Appalachians and
parts of the Southeast on Monday. Moreover, as the system moves
east, heavy rain at times will develop over parts of the Middle
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys on Sunday into Monday. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
areas of rain and thunderstorms.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable on Sunday into Monday
morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0114 AM CDT Sun Oct 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low/dryline will move
eastward across the central CONUS today as a more pronounced upper
trough deepens across the West. Behind the dryline bulge, 15 mph
west-southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-20% RH are
expected for at least a few hours during the afternoon. Given
multiple preceding days of dry and windy conditions, with no
appreciable rainfall accumulations, finer fuels should be primed
enough to support some grass-fire spread, warranting the
continuation of Elevated highlights across parts of the southern
High Plains.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CDT Sun Oct 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Rapid intensification of surface lee-troughing is expected across
much of the High Plains as a potent mid-level trough traverses the
interior West and impinges on the Plains states tomorrow. 15-20 mph
sustained southerly surface winds amid 15-25% RH are likely across
portions of the Colorado Front Range and points southward during the
afternoon. Elevated highlights have been added where the most
favorable surface wind/RH overlap is expected to occur, and where
finer fuels will be most receptive to wildfire spread.

...Storm system to bring a heavy rainfall threat from the
Midwest/South to the Eastern U.S. Wednesday-Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

As one deep cyclone exits the Northeast to start the period on
Wednesday, the next one will be spinning up over the southern
Plains, keeping the weather pattern quite active across the
eastern half of the nation into next weekend. Guidance continues
to trend less progressive and more amplified with this system as
it tracks from the Southern Plains into the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
by next weekend. The latest models show good agreement on the
large scale evolution/track of this system, with a possible
southern stream closed low and deep associated surface low.
Lingering uncertainties remain in the details however, especially
late period. The ECMWF continues to be slightly south of the rest
of the global guidance, but since yesterday, the trend has been to
the south so the ECMWF is not unreasonable. Blended with the 18z
(yesterday) GFS, it provides a reasonable forecast.

Upstream, the next shortwave moves into the Pacific Northwest on
Friday which should bring another threat for heavy rain/mountain
snows to the Northwest later this week. Guidance shows reasonable
agreement with this setup, though timing and strength differences
arise once the system moves inland across the northern Rockies and
into the northern Plains next weekend.

Across the board, WPC relied on a general model blend between the
GFS, ECMWF, and smaller amounts of the CMC for days 3-4. After
this, amidst growing forecast spread in the details and timing of
individual systems, the forecast trended increasingly towards the
ensemble means, with more emphasis on the GEFS over the ECENS mean
because the GEFS had a better southern stream/closed low
separation for the eastern U.S. system. This maintains decent
continuity with the previous WPC forecast with mostly minor
changes needed.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
The bulk of the rainfall on the backside of the low exiting the
Northeast on Wednesday should be offshore by the time the period
begins, but some lingering rainfall is possible on Wednesday
across New England.

The biggest weather threat during the medium range period will be
with a deep low pressure system moving into the east-central U.S.
late this week and into next weekend. Ample Gulf of Mexico
moisture ahead of this system will present a lead
rainfall/convective focus with widespread moderate to locally
heavy rains possible across much of the lower/middle Mississippi
Valley and central Gulf Coast regions on Wednesday. The Storm
Prediction Center also is highlighting the potential for severe
weather across the central Gulf Coast on Wednesday. Closed upper
low development and a slowed frontal system progression will allow
rainfall to expand eastward into the Ohio Valley/Appalachians and
eventually the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Thursday-Saturday.

Out West, a shortwave entering the Northwest mid to late this week
will direct a plume of moisture into the West Coast bringing
another round of heavy rain/mountain snows to mainly parts of the
Pacific Northwest, but also farther inland across the northern
Rockies. Conditions should finally dry out by next weekend.

...There is a High Risk of excessive rainfall for the Sierra
Nevada Mountains and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall for the
Middle Mississippi/Ohio Valleys through Monday morning...

...Heavy snow for the Sierra Nevada Mountains...

...There is an Enhanced Risk of Severe Thunderstorms today across
portions of the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley; a Slight Risk is
in effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast on Monday...

A powerful mid-latitude cyclone will arrive over the Pacific
Northwest this morning. This system will generate enough
precipitation across the region to be classified as an Atmospheric
River event. A storm warning is in effect for the Pacific
Northwest coast, while Flash Flood watches and high wind warnings
have been issued for areas farther inland. Heavy rainfall is
expected for much of the northern/central California as well as
the Pacific Northwest coast, with these areas slated to accumulate
3-6 inches of rain, with isolated higher amounts, over the next
two days. A High Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash
Flooding is in effect for parts of northern California and
including the Sierra. Heavy snow will also occur, with much of the
Sierra Nevada likely to receive in-excess of 2 feet over the next
couple of days. Temperatures will drop significantly in the wake
of this system. High temperatures in California will be between
20-25 degrees below average on Monday, as surface ridging builds
across the state. The Pacific system will go on to produce
moderate rainfall and heavy mountain snow as it moves into the
Rockies on Monday.

Meanwhile, another low pressure system is forecasted to develop
over the Plains today. This system is expected to produce heavy
rainfall and thunderstorms for much of the Mississippi Valley and
Midwest over the next couple of days. Rainfall totals on the
magnitude of 2-3 inches are expected with locally higher amounts
possible. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash
Flooding is in effect across the Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest today as a result. Thunderstorm activity is expected to
take place within the general focus areas of this system over the
next two days. The Storm Prediction Center issued an enhanced risk
of severe thunderstorms for much of the Middle Mississippi Valley
today. The severe and flash flooding threats shift into the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast on Monday, where a Slight Risk of
Severe Thunderstorms was issued by the Storm Prediction Center. An
enhanced fire weather risk continues for parts of the Southern
Plains over the next couple of days, due to warm temperatures and
dry conditions.

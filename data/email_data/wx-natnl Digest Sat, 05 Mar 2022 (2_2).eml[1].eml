...Dynamic system to produce multiple impactful weather hazards
this weekend from significant icing in the Upper Midwest to
thunderstorms and heavy rainfall over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley and Midwest...

...There is a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall leading to Flash
Flooding over portions of the Middle Mississippi Valley and
Midwest on Sunday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley on Saturday and over the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday...

...Record-breaking warmth across parts of the East
Saturday-Monday, with Critical Risk of fire weather over the
Southern Plains through Sunday...

A pair of shortwaves rotating through an upper-level trough will
be the driving force behind the main weather hazards of this
weekend. An area of low pressure over the Central Plains will
intensify today as it moves into the Upper Midwest. Moderate to
heavy snow will fall on its backside over parts of the Central
Great Basin, Intermountain West and Central Rockies today. A swath
of light to moderate snow will expand from the Front Range to the
Upper Midwest as the surface low tracks north and eastward.
Freezing rain will be the main concern within the transition zone
between snow and rain across parts of southern Minnesota, northern
Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula where ice accumulations
may exceed a quarter of an inch by Sunday morning. Ice Storm
Warnings are in effect for much of northern Wisconsin and the
western U.P. as a result.

Severe weather, fire weather and potential record breaking
temperatures will be a concern within the warm sector of this
dynamic system. A well defined warm front will lift northward
across the Midwest and Northeast through Sunday. This will allow
for anomalously warm and moist air to follow and expand across the
eastern half of the country. This will lead to widespread
temperature records being tied or broken across much of the East
through Monday. High temperatures are forecast to range between
20-30 degrees above average during this period. This warm and
moist airmass will also interact with a strong cold front driving
south through the central U.S. leading to the threat of severe
thunderstorms and excessive rainfall across parts of the
Mississippi Valley and Midwest over the next couple of days. The
Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms for much of Iowa, northern Missouri, northwestern
Illinois and southwestern Wisconsin for today. Large hail, a few
tornadoes and damaging wind gusts will be the main concern for
these areas today. As the cold front drives farther south on
Sunday, so will the focus for severe storms. Slight Risks of
Severe Thunderstorms and Excessive Rainfall are in effect for
parts of the ArkLaTex, much of Arkansas, southern
Missouri/Illinois/Indiana, and western Kansas/Tennessee, where the
threat of heavy rainfall and a few tornadoes will be the main
concern. A dryline will develop across the Southern Plains today
and persist through at least Monday morning. These dry conditions
combined with warm air and gusty winds thanks to the deep area of
low pressure to the north will contribute to a Critical Fire
Weather area for parts of the Texas panhandle and central
Oklahoma/Kansas. The threat for Critical Fire Weather will retreat
back into eastern New Mexico and western Texas by Sunday. High
pressure will expand across the West over the coming days leading
to a cooldown, especially for parts of the Front Range where high
temperatures will be between 20-30 degrees below normal.

...Heavy precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest is
forecast to become less intense but will linger across the area
through midweek...

...Mountain snow and lower elevation rain will linger over
northern Rockies while rain and mountain snow linger across
western Oregon...

...Above normal temperatures will expand eastward into the eastern
U.S. but cold conditions with periods of light snow remain across
the northern tier...

The Pacific moisture plume that recently resulted in heavy rain
and snow as well as Avalanche Warnings for portions of the Pacific
Northwest into the northern Rockies is expected to weaken slightly
as it edges slowly inland.  The threat of heavy precipitation is
expected to lessen during the next couple of days across the
Pacific Northwest.  However, unsettled weather is forecast to
continue through midweek as the associated low pressure system
offshore will continue to direct moisture toward the coast.
Meanwhile, a frontal boundary is forecast to slide slowly across
the Pacific Northwest to reach northern California by Wednesday
night, bringing rain and high elevation snow into the region.  The
moisture plume will also bring lingering snow farther inland
across northern Idaho and northwestern Montana for the next couple
of days.  In addition, gusty winds are expected to develop near
the foothills of the northern Rockies.  By Wednesday, a low
pressure wave forming along an arctic front is forecast to spread
the snow eastward into the northern High Plains, reaching into the
Dakotas by Thursday morning.

Meanwhile, a couple of fast-moving low pressure systems forming
along the aforementioned arctic front are expected to bring a
wintry mix across portions of the northern Plains, Great Lakes and
Northeast each day.  The snow and ice are expected to be
relatively light with these systems.  Nevertheless, more than 6
inches of snow is forecast to fall across portions of northern New
York to northern New England over the next couple of days.

Farther to the south, spring-like afternoon temperatures are in
store.  Daytime highs are forecast to climb 10-30 above normal
across most places from the central and southern Plains to the Mid
Atlantic and Southeast today and Wednesday, before an arctic air
mass starts to surge south from the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
later this week.  In contrast, dry conditions and above-normal
temperatures can be expected through midweek from central and
southern California through the central and southern Rockies.

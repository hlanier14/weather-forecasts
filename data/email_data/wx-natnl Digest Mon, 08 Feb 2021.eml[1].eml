Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Sun Feb 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF EASTERN COLORADO...

Added a small critical area in eastern Colorado. Morning guidance
suggests sustained winds in the mid to upper 20s with relative
humidity of 8 to 13 percent in this region. Similar conditions are
expected farther north, but fuels are less favorable due to recent
snowfall.

Also, expanded the elevated area in West Texas eastward as a
stronger low-level jet mixes toward the surface and leads to
stronger surface winds.

..Bentley.. 02/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1224 AM CST Sun Feb 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An expansive upper-level trough situated east of the Rockies should
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Most of the enhanced
mid-level flow will stay confined to northern/central parts of the
CONUS. However, a weak mid-level short-wave trough is forecast to
traverse portions of the Southwest throughout the forecast period.
This process will allow winds over the southern High Plains to take
on a more westerly component, particularly during the afternoon
hours. Diurnally driven momentum transfer should allow these winds
to mix to the surface, resulting in sustained winds of 15-20 mph
during the afternoon. Meanwhile, low-level drying will be aided by a
down-slope orientation of the flow off high terrain across much of
the southern/central High Plains, resulting in RH values into the
teens. Despite marginally receptive fuels, elevated fire-weather
conditions can be expected for this region.

Extended Forecast Discussion

110 PM EST Sun Feb 07 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Feb 10 2021 - 12Z Sun Feb 14 2021

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The main forecast challenge is the evolution of the slow moving,
meandering polar vortex over the Canadian prairies and its
southward/southeastward progression (or lack of) by later in the
period. Sensible weather impacts include northward streaming Gulf
moisture and cyclogenesis along the East Coast and potential
wintry weather. The latest deterministic and ensemble guidance now
favors keeping the core of the polar vortex north of the US border
through day 5 then with the approach of mid/upper level energy out
of the Pacific toward California, then the flow over the CONUS
becomes more zonal and progressive, which lifts the PV northeast
north of the Great Lakes. As this happens, low pressure is still
forecast to develop along the stationary/wavy boundary along the
Gulf Coast/Southeast U.S. and then lift up the East Coast. There
remains run to run variability in how progressive or dominant the
West Coast shortwave will be and its impact downstream with the
PV, especially by day 6/7. So overall forecast confidence is
average to below average by late in the period. The WPC
medium-range forecast package was derived initially from the 06Z
GFS/00z CMC/00Z ECMWF/00Z UKMET followed by mostly a blend of the
06Z GFS, 00Z NAEFS and 00Z ECMWF/ECENS given some of the model
uncertainties later in the period.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A stationary front across southern Florida will lift northward as
a warm front and likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from
the eastern Gulf Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast
midweek.  A quick moving shortwave impulse tracking from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians could bring some
meaningful accumulations of snow to portions of the central
Appalachians from eastern KY to WV and southwest to southern PA.

By midweek, Gulf moisture is forecast to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states and then up the East
Coast in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front across
the northern Gulf.  With the cold air in place farther inland, a
swath of snow and ice remains possible from portions of the Ohio
Valley to the Northeast.  The latest Winter Weather Outlook
probabilities call for a 30-70 percent chances of snow and ice
from upper Ohio Valley to southern New England from Wednesday to
Thursday.

Focus of upslope snow over the Colorado Rockies near the arctic
front will gradually shift to the West Coast as the next Pacific
system pushes moisture onshore by Thursday.  The Cascades and the
Sierra Nevada can expect snowfall to resume and continue into the
weekend while periods of rain affect a good portion of California.

Temperature-wise, the arctic air mass will sustain a large area of
single digit and sub-zero temperatures across the northern to
central Plains where readings will be 30-40F below normal from
midweek into the weekend.  Temperatures reaching 20-35F below
normal may extend into the southern Plains and much of the
Mississippi Valley by later in the week but uncertainty in the
eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in exactly how cold the
East will be at that time.  Most locations west of the Rockies
will see a general cooling trend as the arctic air filters in from
the northeast.  In contrast, temperatures in the Southwest should
average slightly above normal.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The main forecast challenge is the evolution of the slow moving,
meandering polar vortex over the Canadian prairies and its
southward/southeastward progression (or lack of) by later in the
period. Sensible weather impacts include northward streaming Gulf
moisture and cyclogenesis along the East Coast and potential
wintry weather. The latest deterministic and ensemble guidance now
favors keeping the core of the polar vortex north of the US border
through day 5 then with the approach of mid/upper level energy out
of the Pacific toward California, then the flow over the CONUS
becomes more zonal and progressive, which lifts the PV northeast
north of the Great Lakes. As this happens, low pressure is still
forecast to develop along the stationary/wavy boundary along the
Gulf Coast/Southeast U.S. and then lift up the East Coast. There
remains run to run variability in how progressive or dominant the
West Coast shortwave will be and its impact downstream with the
PV, especially by day 6/7. So overall forecast confidence is
average to below average by late in the period. The WPC
medium-range forecast package was derived initially from the 06Z
GFS/00z CMC/00Z ECMWF/00Z UKMET followed by mostly a blend of the
06Z GFS, 00Z NAEFS and 00Z ECMWF/ECENS given some of the model
uncertainties later in the period.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A stationary front across southern Florida will lift northward as
a warm front and likely provide a period of enhanced rainfall from
the eastern Gulf Coast region to the southeastern U.S. coast
midweek.  A quick moving shortwave impulse tracking from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians could bring some
meaningful accumulations of snow to portions of the central
Appalachians from eastern KY to WV and southwest to southern PA.

By midweek, Gulf moisture is forecast to return and expand in
coverage across the southern tier states and then up the East
Coast in an overrunning pattern north of a stationary front across
the northern Gulf.  With the cold air in place farther inland, a
swath of snow and ice remains possible from portions of the Ohio
Valley to the Northeast.  The latest Winter Weather Outlook
probabilities call for a 30-70 percent chances of snow and ice
from upper Ohio Valley to southern New England from Wednesday to
Thursday.

Focus of upslope snow over the Colorado Rockies near the arctic
front will gradually shift to the West Coast as the next Pacific
system pushes moisture onshore by Thursday.  The Cascades and the
Sierra Nevada can expect snowfall to resume and continue into the
weekend while periods of rain affect a good portion of California.

Temperature-wise, the arctic air mass will sustain a large area of
single digit and sub-zero temperatures across the northern to
central Plains where readings will be 30-40F below normal from
midweek into the weekend.  Temperatures reaching 20-35F below
normal may extend into the southern Plains and much of the
Mississippi Valley by later in the week but uncertainty in the
eastern U.S. pattern lowers confidence in exactly how cold the
East will be at that time.  Most locations west of the Rockies
will see a general cooling trend as the arctic air filters in from
the northeast.  In contrast, temperatures in the Southwest should
average slightly above normal.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to persist in the North Central
U.S., prolonged stretch of dangerously cold wind chills to
continue..

...Wave after wave of wintry weather to track across the northern
tier of the Lower 48 through Tuesday...

...Milder conditions across much of the South, showers and
thunderstorms to develop across the Southeast ...

The coastal storm that produced measurable snowfall is racing
northeast and high pressure is building in behind it. Below normal
temperatures return to the Northeast on Monday with high
temperatures struggling to get above freezing. While the Northeast
struggle to crack the freezing mark on Monday, parts of the
Northern Plains will struggle to get above zero as a prolonged
bout with frigid temperatures continue into the middle of the
week. Brutal wind chills as cold as -50 degrees also linger in
portions of the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest through Tuesday.
Due to the dangerously cold conditions, Wind Chill Warnings and
Advisories have been issued for many of these locations through
the first half of the week. The surge of below normal temperatures
advances into the South-Central U.S. on Tuesday. While this cold
is quite anomalous, only a handful of daily low max/min
temperature records are forecast to fall over the next few days.

The first half of the week features several different areas of
wintry weather. Starting in the Northwest, more snowfall is
expected tonight and into Monday over the northern and central
Rockies. The heaviest totals are forecast to occur in the
Bitterroots with snowfall as much as a foot possible. In addition,
Avalanche Warnings remain in place for some areas of the northern
and central Rockies. Meanwhile, a frontal boundary over the
south-central Plains is the focus of freezing rain over parts of
northern Oklahoma tonight. Winter Weather Advisories have been
issued due to the potential for icy conditions, as well as light
snowfall this evening over eastern Nebraska and southwest Iowa. By
Monday, snow showers head into the Midwest where light
accumulations are possible. A developing area of low pressure then
tracks through the lower Great Lakes Monday night and into the
Northeast by Tuesday. This will leave a swath of light snow
accumulations in these area with amounts as high as 6 inches
possible in parts of the interior Northeast on Tuesday.

Across the South, above normal temperatures are anticipated in the
Southwest and along the Gulf Coast. A stalled frontal boundary
over South Florida will act to ignite some spotty showers and
thunderstorms on Monday. This front will then move north of out of
the Gulf of Mexico and become the trigger for scattered showers
and thunderstorms Monday night and into Tuesday along the Gulf
Coast. The area that may receive the heaviest rainfall totals
would be from eastern Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle on
Tuesday. Conversely, dry and mild conditions persist into the
middle of the work-week throughout the Southwest.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 PM CST Sun Feb 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

Expanded the elevated area northward into eastern Colorado in a
similar area to today's outlook. Winds are expected to be as strong
or possibly stronger tomorrow with less than 10 percent relative
humidity. Temperatures may remain a bit on the cool side, but
otherwise conditions are favorable for large fire spread.

..Bentley.. 02/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1225 AM CST Sun Feb 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level flow pattern is forecast to change very little
across much of the CONUS. An upper-level trough will remain
entrenched across the central U.S., resulting in broad regions of
enhanced westerly mid-level flow. Once again, diurnal heating and
vertical mixing, combined with down-slope winds off high terrain,
will result in a wind/rh combo conducive for elevated fire-weather
conditions across the southern High Plains. Areas farther north,
into the central High Plains, may also experience localized/brief
elevated fire-weather conditions, however surface temperatures may
remain a bit too cool to fully realize this threat. Fuels remain
marginally receptive to large-fire spread in most locations, but
fuels are becoming increasingly more receptive given several
consecutive days of dry conditions.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun February 07 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

...Arctic air lingers over the Plains and the Midwest...
...Possible Mid-Atlantic to Northeast U.S. winter storm late this
week as unsettled weather reaches the West Coast...

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment with
Weather/Threats Highlights...

Latest model guidance continues to show that an arctic air mass
will dominate the northern and central portions of the country
into this weekend under the influence of a slow-moving polar
vortex centered over the Canadian prairies.  There is general
agreement that the vortex will slowly slide eastward and
weaken/open up with time.  Meanwhile, models continue to advertise
a significant influx of Gulf moisture across the Deep South into
the Southeast mid to late this week to the north of the polar
front.  A swath of wintry precipitation remains in the forecast
from the Ohio Valley to portions of the Northeast mainly on
Thursday and Friday as a couple of frontal waves develop well to
the south.  Latest model consensus has trended slightly toward
less amplitude and a more offshore storm track.  This is in
response to a model trend of rotating less energy to the south of
the polar vortex across the Great Lakes late this week--a change
that is most noticeable in the GFS, which now agrees much better
with the ECMWF regarding this feature.

Meanwhile, models have continued to slow down the southward
intrusion of the arctic air mass through the mountainous terrain
of the western U.S., with a better signal for upslope snows to
linger over the northern to central Rockies.  A couple of
weakening Pacific systems will then push onshore into the West
Coast with mountain snows and rain for the lower elevations
through the latter half of the week into next Monday.  Much of the
precipitation should fall along and to the west of the Cascades
and down into California.  Some of the moisture will spread into
the Great Basin and interior Southwest, reaching the central to
southern Rockies by the weekend.

Elsewhere, upper-level energy ejecting from the central Rockies
could bring a swath of light snow across the north-central Plains
Thursday into Friday.  By next Monday, Gulf moisture could be
returning into the southern Plains with some wintry weather
possible over the central Plains.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived from a composite
blend of the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 18Z GFS/GEFS, together with a
smaller contribution from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean and the 01Z NBM.
More of the ensemble means were used on Days 6 and 7 as well given
the increasing model uncertainties.  The GFS and the CMC were
eliminated on these two days due to spurious cyclogenesis on the
East and West Coasts respectively.

...Bitterly cold temperatures and dangerous wind chills to persist
across the north-central United States...

...Two rounds of light snowfall and freezing rain to impact areas
from the Central/Southern Plains to Northeast...

Residents across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest will start
off the work week with continued below average temperatures and
brutal wind chills. Wind Chill Advisories and Warnings remain in
effect from Montana to the U.P. of Michigan. Wind chill values
well below zero and as low as -50 degrees could be experienced at
times across this region. While not as extreme, this cold airmass
stretches as far south as Oklahoma and as far east as the Ohio
Valley. Widespread temperatures 20 to 30 degrees below average can
found across these areas thanks to a strong high pressure system
and constant flow of bitter arctic air from southwest Canada.
Unfortunately, these below average temperatures don't appear to
moderate or exit in the foreseeable future. Looking for some
mid-winter warmth? Much of the Southeast and south-central U.S.
will enjoy above average temperatures through Wednesday.

With cold air in place across the northern U.S. and a stalled
frontal boundary bisecting the middle of the country, multiple
rounds of wintry precipiation are expected from the
Southern/Central Plains to the Northeast. Starting with today,
light snowfall is expected to continue across the Northern Rockies
and add to the recent fresh snowpack that has accumulated over the
last several days. Winter Weather Advisories and Avalanche
Warnings are in effect across much of the mountainous terrain in
Montana and northern Idaho. Light snow will also be found across
the Central Plains and Midwest today as a wave of low pressure
develops along the frontal boundary and moves toward the Northeast
by Tuesday. Generally around 2 to 4 inches of snow can be expected
for these locations, with higher amounts up to 6 inches possible
across the Northeast. A mix of sleet, snow, and freezing rain will
be possible across northeast Oklahoma and southern Missouri
through tonight as well. By Wednesday morning another round of
wintry weather is expected to develop across similar regions from
the southern Plains to Midwest. More impactful freezing rain
accretion will be possible and this time stretch from northeast
Oklahoma to northern Kentucky.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Mon Feb 08 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
While broad cyclonic flow aloft and associated surface high pressure
will prevail across much of the CONUS, an embedded mid-level impulse
is expected to traverse the south-central U.S during the day.
Surface lee troughing along the southern High Plains, coincident
with diurnal heating, is expected to promote dry and breezy
downslope flow along the lee of the southern Rockies, with
wildfire-spread conditions expected.

...Southern High Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, the dry downslope flow will encourage 20%
surface RH across the Colorado Front Range, with RH as low as 10%
likely across eastern New Mexico into the Trans Pecos region in
southwest Texas. As 20+ mph sustained westerly downslope flow is
expected to overspread the southern High Plains, the wind/RH overlap
will promote favorable wildfire-spread conditions, warranting an
Elevated delineation. A Critical area was added where 10% RH is
expected to overlap with 20-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds
for several hours this afternoon, and where fuels are modestly
receptive to fire spread. Elsewhere within the Elevated delineation,
locally Critical wind/RH are possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CST Mon Feb 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move across the southwest U.S during the Day
2/Tuesday period. While surface high pressure and associated cool
conditions are expected to prevail across much of the central U.S
Tuesday, the approach of the aforementioned mid-level trough from
the west will encourage surface lee troughing across the southern
High Plains. Dry and breezy conditions Tuesday afternoon across the
southern High Plains will support some potential for wildfire
spread.

...Southern High Plains...
Downslope flow across eastern New Mexico into the Trans Pecos region
of southwest Texas is expected to promote 15-20 mph sustained
westerly surface winds overlapping with 10-20% RH during the
afternoon hours. An Elevated area was delineated to account for
favorable wildfire-spread conditions over fuels modestly receptive
to fire spread. However, the latest guidance depicts at least
locally Critical conditions across eastern New Mexico during the mid
to late afternoon hours. If future guidance suggests that 20 mph
wind speeds can be maintained for longer than currently anticipated,
a Critical area may be added in future outlooks.

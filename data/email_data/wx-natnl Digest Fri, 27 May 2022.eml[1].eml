Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1104 AM CDT Thu May 26 2022

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

Only minor modifications were made to the ongoing forecast based on
current guidance. Widely scattered virga showers with gusty outflow
winds are possible in central/northern Nevada. Thermodynamic
profiles remain marginally supportive of a few lightning flashes
across the region. With most area fuels still only marginally dry,
particularly the larger fuels, ignition efficiency from any
lightning activity is expected to be low.

..Wendt.. 05/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0107 AM CDT Thu May 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather concerns remain likely this afternoon across
northwestern to southern Nevada. Early-morning water vapor imagery
reveals an upper-level wave approaching the Pacific Northwest.
Surface pressure falls across the northern Great Basin will induce
south to southwesterly winds off the Sierra Nevada and lower CO
River Valley. Sustained winds between 15 to 20 mph are expected by
early afternoon based on ensemble guidance. However, deep
boundary-layer mixing will support frequent wind gusts between 25-35
mph, especially across central to southern NV where nearly all
solutions show the strongest low-level mass response. Downslope
effects, combined with antecedent dry conditions and diurnal
warming, will support RH reductions into the 10-15% range across
much of the region. Consequently, elevated (to briefly critical)
fire weather conditions appear likely, including across far western
NV where several lightning strikes were noted Wednesday afternoon.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The approaching upper low will also support the potential for
isolated to scattered thunderstorms by late afternoon across the
Pacific Northwest and parts of the northern Great Basin. Observed 00
UTC soundings show an increase in column precipitable water over the
region, but values remain near 0.3 to 0.5 inches. Continued
moistening is expected, but PWATs will likely remain near 0.5 to
0.75 across NV and will support a dry-lightning threat. While the
probability for thunderstorms is highest across portions of OR, WA,
and ID, a few dry thunderstorms are possible across central to
northern NV. An isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area is introduced
where confidence in thunderstorms overlapping with critically dry
fuels is highest.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 26 2022

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, areas of mid-level low pressure are forecast alo=
ng
the West Coast of the Contiguous U.S. (CONUS), and over the north-central
CONUS, near the Canadian border. These features increase the chances for hi=
gh
winds over parts of the West Coast, the Four Corners Region, and High Plain=
s,
and also favor unseasonably cool temperatures over parts of the Midwest and
eastern CONUS. By the middle of the period, the pattern is forecast to beco=
me
less amplified, although there are indications of increased broad mid-level
high pressure developing over the south-central CONUS, with excessive heat
concerns increasing across parts of the Southern Plains. Flooding risks rem=
ain
elevated across the Red River of the North and northern Minnesota.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Southeast and the
coastal Carolinas, Fri-Tue, Jun 3-7.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of coastal California and Oregon, th=
e
Four Corners Region, and the Central and Southern High Plains, Fri-Sun, Jun=
 3-
5.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of the Southern Plains, Sat-Thu,
Jun
4-9.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North and northern
Minnesota.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 29 - THURSDAY JUNE 02:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!4K7U13b-ecVwVmyCasEgFRVx-cRpwj5T5UTK2AR0sg8MDHzzbcHB4CyvE5d0s=
D8Rk3Fn7JNeAfqPoqzJ2X_vehJIcp4$

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 03 - THURSDAY JUNE 09: At the beginning of week-2, troughin=
g
is
predicted to shift from the north-central CONUS into the eastern CONUS. The=
 0z
and 6z GEFS are more amplified with this trough compared to the ECMWF
ensemble,
and as a result, depict larger negative temperature anomalies. This evoluti=
on
is apparent in the reforecast tools, where the ECMWF indicates at least a 2=
0
percent chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th climatological
percentile and 40 deg F across the Northern Plains, and the GEFS expands th=
ese
elevated probabilities into parts of the northern Great lakes and interior
Northeast. However, uncalibrated deterministic guidance from the 0z and 6z
GFS,
and the 0z ECMWF, along with their ensemble means, all keep overnight
temperatures above 40 deg F over the aforementioned areas. Given this
relatively warmer uncalibrated guidance, and lack of agreement in terms of =
the
magnitude of the trough between the ECMWF and GEFS, a much below normal
temperature hazard is not posted in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlo=
ok. While not necessarily
hazardous, a period of unseasonably cool weather is possible across the
Midwest, and eventually expanding further into the eastern CONUS, which wil=
l
be
a big change from the very warm temperatures forecast in week-1 over these
areas.



The aforementioned troughing in the East is forecast to promote an increase=
 in
tropical moisture flow across the southeastern CONUS. The greater amplitude=
 of
troughing in the East depicted in the GEFS results in a cold front that pus=
hes
further south keeping the heavier rainfall totals (greater than 3 inches
throughout week-2 in some areas) over south Florida. The heaviest week-2
rainfall totals are a bit lower in the ECMWF ensemble (1.5 to 3 inches), bu=
t
are also expanded farther north relative to the GEFS given the less
progressive
front and weaker trough. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate =
at
least a 20 percent chance 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85th
climatological percentile and 1 inch through the middle of the period over =
the
area. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted across
parts of the Southeast, and extending north through the coastal Carolinas,
from
Jun 3-7.



The trough near the West Coast of the CONUS favors elevated chances for hig=
h
winds along parts of the California and Oregon Coast, and inland over the F=
our
Corners Region and Central and Southern High Plains. The ECMWF reforecast t=
ool
depicts at least a 20 percent chance wind speeds exceed the 85th percentile
and
20-mph across these areas, and a slight risk of high winds is posted from J=
un
3-5. Increased wind speeds over regions with severe and, in some cases,
exceptional drought conditions favor an increased potential for wildfires.



Downstream of the troughing, broad ridging is predicted to develop, ending =
the
threat for much below normal temperatures across the interior West, and
resulting in positive temperature anomalies increasing over the south-centr=
al
CONUS. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent
chance maximum temperatures exceed the 85th percentile and 95 deg F startin=
g
on
day-9 (Jun 4) over parts of the Southern Plains, and possibly exceed 100 de=
g F
across southwestern Texas. Additionally, the composite ECMWF/GEFS heat
probabilistic tool depicts areas of Texas having increased potential (20-40
percent chance) for heat indices of 105-110 deg F during week-2, supporting
the
slight risk of excessive heat valid Jun 4-9.



River flooding is ongoing across areas along the Red River of the North and
Northern Minnesota. Heavy rain is forecast over these areas late in the wee=
k-1
period, which favors the flooding risks to persist into week-2. River level=
s
are forecast to drop below flood stage across the Central and Southern Plai=
ns,
allowing the flooding possible shape to be discontinued over that region.

Extended Forecast Discussion

300 PM EDT Thu May 26 2022

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward to the Central
Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an evolution toward an amplified
western trough/eastern ridge aloft Sunday-Tuesday, with the
western trough likely most amplified around Monday and the eastern
ridge strongest around Tuesday.  Consensus then shows a rapid
flattening of the mean pattern as the western energy ejects and
southern tier ridging retrogrades to some degree.  By Thursday an
approaching eastern Pacific trough may even support a weak upper
ridge over the Interior West.  The initial amplified
pattern/western upper dynamics will support potential for some
areas of heavy precipitation from the northern Rockies into the
Plains/Upper Midwest, followed by a transition to more emphasis
for heavy rainfall over the central Plains as a wavy front begins
to push southeastward.  An area of very cool temperatures will
progress through the West into the northern Plains early in the
week and then modify as it reaches the rest of the Plains.
Meanwhile very warm to hot weather initially over the
Plains/Midwest will shift into the northern half to two-thirds of
the eastern U.S.  Duration of warm tempertures over the Northeast
is a question mark however, as flow around a broad upper low over
eastern Canada may push a front into/through the region.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The updated forecast accounting for 00Z/06Z guidance started with
an operational model composite (more GFS component from the 00Z
versus 06Z run) early in the period and then trended toward 50-60
percent total 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input as specifics became
increasingly uncertain.  There are various aspects of the forecast
that have been exhibiting spread/trends over recent runs.  Issues
with the western trough involve how Sunday-Monday energy will
ultimately eject from the trough, with peripheral influence from
Pacific flow (just offshore the Pacific Northwest as well as
upstream) plus central Canada troughing/possible embedded low that
have become more pronounced in latest runs and may interact with
the ejecting energy.  In general the primary trend over the past
couple days has been for the western energy to eject a bit faster,
but with no real consensus yet for the details.  The past couple
UKMET runs have been rather extreme with the speed of upstream
Pacific flow and southeastward amplitude of troughing that
eventually reaches the Plains (the latter being an error in some
UKMET runs with a prior ejecting feature around a couple weeks
ago).  At the same time most guidance has generally trended more
pronounced with flow around an upper low crossing far eastern
Canada, bringing a better defined cold front through parts of the
Northeast and perhaps stalling this front for a time somewhere
between the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England (with a lot of
spread in the guidance at this time).  The 06Z GFS compared more
poorly to consensus for the upper low track/cyclonic flow
amplitude versus the 00Z run or most other guidance.  The 12Z GFS
returned somewhat closer to the majority.  By next Thursday there
is decent agreement on a more progressive/low amplitude shortwave
over the Upper Midwest pushing along the central U.S. front from
earlier in the week, while a weak upper ridge reaches the West.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

From Sunday into the early part of the next work week, the upper
low moving over the parts of the West along with areas of low
level upslope flow should combine to generate a period of moderate
to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High Plains
while a slowly moving wavy frontal system over the Plains could
help to focus locally heavy rainfall as far east as the Upper
Midwest.  Currently expect heaviest totals over parts of Montana
and northern Wyoming with significant snowfall possible in higher
elevations of the Rockies.  The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring the potential for severe weather over parts of the
Plains/Upper Midwest in the Sunday-Monday time frame.  Toward
midweek the flatter trend for the upper pattern should begin to
push the Plains front southeastward, likely shifting the emphasis
for heaviest rainfall into or near the central Plains.  The
extreme southern tier including Florida may see some scattered
diurnally favored convection, aided by energy aloft to the south
of the eastern U.S. upper ridge.  Parts of the Northeast could see
one or more episodes of rainfall with a cold front that moves
into/through the region and possibly stalls for a time over New
England or the northern Mid-Atlantic.  Some rainfall could be
locally moderate to heavy but with low confidence in details thus
far.

Warmest temperature anomalies on Sunday will extend from the
southern High Plains into the Midwest, with some locations up to
10-20F above normal.  Parts of the central/southern Plains may see
the very warm to hot weather persist into early next week but
otherwise the emphasis for heat will shift more into the northern
half to two-thirds of the East with a broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies and perhaps some daily records, more for morning lows
versus daytime highs.  The front over the Northeast may bring a
cooling trend to parts of that region though.  On the other hand,
well below normal temperatures will push across the West into the
northern Plains Sunday onward, with a broad area of highs 10-20F
below normal Sunday-Tuesday.  Some lingering minus 10-15F
anomalies are possible into Wednesday over the northern-central
Plains but further moderation is likely thereafter.  A warmer
trend over the West will bring moderately above normal highs into
the region by Wednesday-Thursday.

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward to the Central
Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an evolution toward an amplified
western trough/eastern ridge aloft Sunday-Tuesday, with the
western trough likely most amplified around Monday and the eastern
ridge strongest around Tuesday.  Consensus then shows a rapid
flattening of the mean pattern as the western energy ejects and
southern tier ridging retrogrades to some degree.  By Thursday an
approaching eastern Pacific trough may even support a weak upper
ridge over the Interior West.  The initial amplified
pattern/western upper dynamics will support potential for some
areas of heavy precipitation from the northern Rockies into the
Plains/Upper Midwest, followed by a transition to more emphasis
for heavy rainfall over the central Plains as a wavy front begins
to push southeastward.  An area of very cool temperatures will
progress through the West into the northern Plains early in the
week and then modify as it reaches the rest of the Plains.
Meanwhile very warm to hot weather initially over the
Plains/Midwest will shift into the northern half to two-thirds of
the eastern U.S.  Duration of warm tempertures over the Northeast
is a question mark however, as flow around a broad upper low over
eastern Canada may push a front into/through the region.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The updated forecast accounting for 00Z/06Z guidance started with
an operational model composite (more GFS component from the 00Z
versus 06Z run) early in the period and then trended toward 50-60
percent total 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input as specifics became
increasingly uncertain.  There are various aspects of the forecast
that have been exhibiting spread/trends over recent runs.  Issues
with the western trough involve how Sunday-Monday energy will
ultimately eject from the trough, with peripheral influence from
Pacific flow (just offshore the Pacific Northwest as well as
upstream) plus central Canada troughing/possible embedded low that
have become more pronounced in latest runs and may interact with
the ejecting energy.  In general the primary trend over the past
couple days has been for the western energy to eject a bit faster,
but with no real consensus yet for the details.  The past couple
UKMET runs have been rather extreme with the speed of upstream

pronounced with flow around an upper low crossing far eastern
Canada, bringing a better defined cold front through parts of the
Northeast and perhaps stalling this front for a time somewhere
between the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England (with a lot of
spread in the guidance at this time).  The 06Z GFS compared more
poorly to consensus for the upper low track/cyclonic flow
amplitude versus the 00Z run or most other guidance.  The 12Z GFS
returned somewhat closer to the majority.  By next Thursday there
is decent agreement on a more progressive/low amplitude shortwave
over the Upper Midwest pushing along the central U.S. front from
earlier in the week, while a weak upper ridge reaches the West.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

From Sunday into the early part of the next work week, the upper
low moving over the parts of the West along with areas of low
level upslope flow should combine to generate a period of moderate
to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High Plains
while a slowly moving wavy frontal system over the Plains could
help to focus locally heavy rainfall as far east as the Upper
Midwest.  Currently expect heaviest totals over parts of Montana
and northern Wyoming with significant snowfall possible in higher
elevations of the Rockies.  The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring the potential for severe weather over parts of the
Plains/Upper Midwest in the Sunday-Monday time frame.  Toward
midweek the flatter trend for the upper pattern should begin to
push the Plains front southeastward, likely shifting the emphasis
for heaviest rainfall into or near the central Plains.  The
extreme southern tier including Florida may see some scattered
diurnally favored convection, aided by energy aloft to the south
of the eastern U.S. upper ridge.  Parts of the Northeast could see
one or more episodes of rainfall with a cold front that moves
into/through the region and possibly stalls for a time over New
England or the northern Mid-Atlantic.  Some rainfall could be
locally moderate to heavy but with low confidence in details thus
far.

Warmest temperature anomalies on Sunday will extend from the
southern High Plains into the Midwest, with some locations up to
10-20F above normal.  Parts of the central/southern Plains may see
the very warm to hot weather persist into early next week but
otherwise the emphasis for heat will shift more into the northern
half to two-thirds of the East with a broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies and perhaps some daily records, more for morning lows
versus daytime highs.  The front over the Northeast may bring a
cooling trend to parts of that region though.  On the other hand,
well below normal temperatures will push across the West into the
northern Plains Sunday onward, with a broad area of highs 10-20F
below normal Sunday-Tuesday.  Some lingering minus 10-15F
anomalies are possible into Wednesday over the northern-central
Plains but further moderation is likely thereafter.  A warmer
trend over the West will bring moderately above normal highs into
the region by Wednesday-Thursday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 26 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 01 - 05 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the forecast mid-level
circulation pattern across the North American region. A trough is forecast
over
the southern Aleutians expanding eastward to near the west coast. Downstrea=
m,
a
mean ridge is forecast over the Rockies northwestward to northwestern Canad=
a
extending into eastern Mainland Alaska with slightly above normal 500-hPa
heights over Alaska and parts of the eastern CONUS.

Above normal temperatures are favored over Alaska under positive 500-hPa
height
anomalies. Above normal temperatures are likely for parts of the Pacific
Northwest consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal
temperatures are favored over parts of the north-central CONUS due to forec=
ast
low-level northerly flow. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts o=
f
the Southwestern CONUS, Southern Plains and the eastern CONUS consistent wi=
th
the consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of northern Mainla=
nd
Alaska, consistent with dynamical model precipitation tools. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the Pacific Northwest ahead of a forec=
ast
trough. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Great Basin,
underneath a forecast mean ridge.  Above normal precipitation is favored fo=
r
parts of the southern Rockies, Central Plains and Southeast due to forecast
low-level southerly moisture flow and shortwave systems moving across the
region. Below normal precipitation is likely for parts of the Great lakes
region under a  de-amplified ridge.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=
's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools and increased model spread later in the period=
.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 03 - 09 2022

The predicted circulation pattern for the 6-10 day period persists into the
week-2, however 500-hPa height anomalies are further weaken in the week-2
ensemble means and the manual blend due to a significant increase in
uncertainty. Weak troughing is forecast over the western coast and eastern
CONUS. A weak ridge persists over much of the north-central CONUS. Near
average
mid-level heights are forecast over much of the forecast domain.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska consistent with t=
he
consolidation forecast tool. Below normal temperatures are slightly favored
for
parts of the Pacific Northwest and most of north-central CONUS consistent w=
ith
temperature reforecast tools. Above normal temperatures are favored for par=
ts
of the Great Basin, Southwest, the Southern Plains, the Lower Mississippi
Valley, and parts of the Southeast, consistent with the temperature
consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for eastern Mainland Alaska,
consistent with the dynamical model forecasts. Near to above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies, and parts of the Northern Plains, ahead of a predicted mean trough=
.
Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the Great Basin
and
Southwest, supported by dynamical model precipitation tools. Above normal
precipitation is favored for portions of the Southwest, as moisture flow is
drawn northward into the region. Below normal precipitation is favored for
parts of the Southern Plains northward towards the Great Lakes, consistent
with
the precipitation consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is favored
for
much of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic, consistent with the precipitation
consolidation tool and increased moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico and =
the
Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to predicted very weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the foreca=
st
domain and weak and conflicting signals in the temperature and precipitatio=
n
tools over most regions.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN NEVADA INTO
SOUTHWESTERN UTAH...

Critical fire weather conditions appear more likely just ahead of a
southeastward moving surface boundary. Parts of southern Nevada and
southwestern Utah have greater potential for a few hours of
sustained 20+ mph winds. Elsewhere, elevated to locally critical
conditions are still expected across a broad area of the Great Basin
and Southwest. See the previous discussion for details.

..Wendt.. 05/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Thu May 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
Increasing west to southwest winds across parts of the southern
Great Basin, Southwest, and Four Corners will lead to a broad swath
of fire weather concerns Friday afternoon. The upper-level wave
currently approaching the Pacific Northwest is forecast to translate
into the northern Rockies by late Friday. Falling heights aloft will
support modest surface pressure falls over the inter-mountain West,
resulting in a broad low-level mass response from the southern Great
Basin into the Four Corners and Southwest. Ensemble guidance and
deterministic solutions generally suggest that 15-20 mph winds will
be common across this region. Drier/windier solutions indicate that
areas of 20-25 mph winds are possible, but considerable spread in
deterministic solutions introduces uncertainty regarding the exact
placement and coverage of the strongest winds. Strong mid and
upper-level winds will largely be displaced to the north of the
region, which further limits confidence on where the windiest
corridors will be established within the risk area.

Nonetheless, dry conditions will prevail with 10-15% RH values
expected by late afternoon. Widespread elevated conditions are
likely, and a few corridors of critical conditions are possible.
Similar wind/RH conditions are possible across much of the southern
High Plains as well, but widespread rainfall over the past few days
has mitigated fuel status for the time being. Fuel trends will be
monitored for a possible expansion, but Friday's warm/dry conditions
will likely begin the drying process for most locations as
temperatures rebound into the 90s.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast through Friday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe storms over parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the Central Gulf Coast and the Southeast
through Friday morning...

... There is a Slight Risk of severe storms and excessive rainfall
over parts of the Mid-Atlantic from Friday to Saturday morning...

On Thursday night, a front extending from the Great Lakes, Middle
Mississippi Valley to the Central Gulf Coast will move eastward to
the East Coast by Saturday. Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and ahead of the boundary through Saturday. In addition, the
front and moisture pooling along the boundary will destabilize the
atmosphere. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Central Gulf Coast and the Southeast through Friday morning. The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes.

In addition, showers and thunderstorms develop along the boundary
from the Midwest to the Central Gulf Coast. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over the Central Gulf
Coast through Friday morning. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through Friday
morning. In addition, Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over
portions of the Central Gulf Coast, Central/Southern Appalachians,
and a second area over parts of the Upper Great Lakes/Upper
Mississippi Valley through Friday morning, too. Again, the
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable.

On Friday, the front continues to inch eastward. As a result,
showers and thunderstorms will develop from the Northeast to the
Southeast and Gulf Coast. In addition, there will be severe
thunderstorms associated with the boundary. Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic from Friday into Saturday morning. Furthermore, heavy
rain will be associated with the thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC
has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over Mid-Atlantic
from Friday into Saturday morning. On Saturday, showers and
thunderstorms will continue over the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Coast
and the Florida Peninsula.

Additionally, by Friday evening, a front and associated
upper-level trough will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest,
moving eastward to the Northern High Plains/Great Basin. The
trough is relatively robust. Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern Intermountain Region through Friday morning.
The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a minimal
threat for tornadoes.

On Friday, the showers and thunderstorms will continue over parts
of the Northern High Plains and Northern Plains. By Saturday, the
front moves to the Upper Mississippi Valley and the threat of
severe thunderstorms develops over the Upper Midwest. Therefore,
the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over
parts of the Northern/Central Plains and a portion of the Upper
Mississippi Valley on Saturday. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

...Potential for heavy precipitation next week from the northern
Rockies to Upper Midwest and then southward to the Central
Plains...

...Weather Pattern Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an evolution toward an amplified
western trough/eastern ridge aloft Sunday-Tuesday, with the
western trough likely most amplified around Monday and the eastern
ridge strongest around Tuesday.  Consensus then shows a rapid
flattening of the mean pattern as the western energy ejects and
southern tier ridging retrogrades to some degree.  By Thursday an
approaching eastern Pacific trough may even support a weak upper
ridge over the Interior West.  The initial amplified
pattern/western upper dynamics will support potential for some
areas of heavy precipitation from the northern Rockies into the
Plains/Upper Midwest, followed by a transition to more emphasis
for heavy rainfall over the central Plains as a wavy front begins
to push southeastward.  An area of very cool temperatures will
progress through the West into the northern Plains early in the
week and then modify as it reaches the rest of the Plains.
Meanwhile very warm to hot weather initially over the
Plains/Midwest will shift into the northern half to two-thirds of
the eastern U.S.  Duration of warm temperatures over the Northeast
is a question mark however, as flow around a broad upper low over
eastern Canada may push a front into/through the region.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The updated forecast accounting for 00Z/06Z guidance started with
an operational model composite (more GFS component from the 00Z
versus 06Z run) early in the period and then trended toward 50-60
percent total 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF mean input as specifics became
increasingly uncertain.  There are various aspects of the forecast
that have been exhibiting spread/trends over recent runs.  Issues
with the western trough involve how Sunday-Monday energy will
ultimately eject from the trough, with peripheral influence from
Pacific flow (just offshore the Pacific Northwest as well as
upstream) plus central Canada troughing/possible embedded low that
have become more pronounced in latest runs and may interact with
the ejecting energy.  In general the primary trend over the past
couple days has been for the western energy to eject a bit faster,
but with no real consensus yet for the details.  The past couple
UKMET runs have been rather extreme with the speed of upstream
Pacific flow and southeastward amplitude of troughing that
eventually reaches the Plains (the latter being an error in some
UKMET runs with a prior ejecting feature around a couple weeks
ago).  At the same time most guidance has generally trended more
pronounced with flow around an upper low crossing far eastern
Canada, bringing a better defined cold front through parts of the
Northeast and perhaps stalling this front for a time somewhere
between the northern Mid-Atlantic and New England (with a lot of
spread in the guidance at this time).  The 06Z GFS compared more
poorly to consensus for the upper low track/cyclonic flow
amplitude versus the 00Z run or most other guidance.  The 12Z GFS
returned somewhat closer to the majority.  By next Thursday there
is decent agreement on a more progressive/low amplitude shortwave
over the Upper Midwest pushing along the central U.S. front from
earlier in the week, while a weak upper ridge reaches the West.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

From Sunday into the early part of the next work week, the upper
low moving over the parts of the West along with areas of low
level upslope flow should combine to generate a period of moderate
to heavy precipitation over the northern Rockies and High Plains
while a slowly moving wavy frontal system over the Plains could
help to focus locally heavy rainfall as far east as the Upper
Midwest.  Currently expect heaviest totals over parts of Montana
and northern Wyoming with significant snowfall possible in higher
elevations of the Rockies.  The Storm Prediction Center is also
monitoring the potential for severe weather over parts of the
Plains/Upper Midwest in the Sunday-Monday time frame.  Toward
midweek the flatter trend for the upper pattern should begin to
push the Plains front southeastward, likely shifting the emphasis
for heaviest rainfall into or near the central Plains.  The
extreme southern tier including Florida may see some scattered
diurnally favored convection, aided by energy aloft to the south
of the eastern U.S. upper ridge.  Parts of the Northeast could see
one or more episodes of rainfall with a cold front that moves
into/through the region and possibly stalls for a time over New
England or the northern Mid-Atlantic.  Some rainfall could be
locally moderate to heavy but with low confidence in details thus
far.

Warmest temperature anomalies on Sunday will extend from the
southern High Plains into the Midwest, with some locations up to
10-20F above normal.  Parts of the central/southern Plains may see
the very warm to hot weather persist into early next week but
otherwise the emphasis for heat will shift more into the northern
half to two-thirds of the East with a broad area of plus 10-20F
anomalies and perhaps some daily records, more for morning lows
versus daytime highs.  The front over the Northeast may bring a
cooling trend to parts of that region though.  On the other hand,
well below normal temperatures will push across the West into the
northern Plains Sunday onward, with a broad area of highs 10-20F
below normal Sunday-Tuesday.  Some lingering minus 10-15F
anomalies are possible into Wednesday over the northern-central
Plains but further moderation is likely thereafter.  A warmer
trend over the West will bring moderately above normal highs into
the region by Wednesday-Thursday.

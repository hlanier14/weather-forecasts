Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. 12Z DDC and LMN observed
soundings show very dry vertical profiles extending up to at least
500 mb. With clear skies present, the boundary layer is expected to
quickly become well-mixed through the afternoon. 15+ mph sustained
southerly surface winds coinciding with 15-25% RH is expected by 18Z
based on the latest guidance consensus, warranting the continuation
of Elevated highlights given the presence of drying fuels.

Elevated highlights were considered for portions of central Nevada,
as boundary-layer mixing is expected to support at least localized
areas of 15-20 mph sustained southwesterly winds amid 10-20% RH, but
the spatially limited nature of the Elevated conditions, along with
modest receptiveness of fuels to fire spread, preclude fire weather
highlights. Likewise, a couple of dry thunderstorms are possible
across portions of northeast Nevada towards the Idaho/Utah border
later this afternoon. However, the sparse nature of the dry
thunderstorm threat along with only patchy receptive fuels also
preclude dry thunderstorm highlights for portions of the Great
Basin.

..Squitieri.. 09/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
Cyclogenesis is forecast in the central Plains today as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough crosses the Rockies. The surface pressure
gradient is expected to tighten during the afternoon which should
result in winds of 15 to 20 mph across much of Kansas and Oklahoma
into the Texas Panhandle. The dry Southwest airmass extends
northeastward across the Texas Panhandle into southwest Kansas. This
is the area where large fire concerns are greatest as relative
humidity will be 10 to 15 percent. Fuels are also drying
considerably with ERCs now above the 85th percentile.

A mix of both wet and dry thunderstorms may be possible across
northern Utah and southeast Idaho into western Wyoming, but there is
not enough overlap with dry fuels and storm confidence to include an
isolated dry thunderstorm area at this time.

...Tropical Storm Nicholas Likely to Bring Heavy Rain to
Southern/Eastern Texas and Louisiana through the middle of next
week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The wave reaching the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has developed
sufficiently for the National Hurricane Center to start advisories
for Tropical Storm Nicholas. Based on the 15Z advisory Nicholas
should track generally northward in the short term, close to the
Texas coast by Monday-Tuesday, and reach southeastern Texas as a
tropical depression as of the start of the medium range period
early Wednesday. Expect Nicholas to bring a threat of heavy
rainfall to portions of southeastern Texas and Louisiana through
at least Wednesday and possibly beyond depending on how long the
system persists. GFS/ECMWF runs continue to show the best
definition and northward extent (though with the GFS straying to
the east side of the latest spread and the 00Z ECMWF slower than
the NHC forecast) but additional differences in other guidance
still keep confidence for specifics lower than desired.

Farther north the models and ensembles agree on the general
evolution toward a deepening mean trough aloft along the West
Coast late this week into the weekend while western
Atlantic/eastern U.S. ridging (or at least well above normal
heights) deflects the westerlies across the northern tier U.S. and
southern/eastern Canada.  Especially after early Thursday model
differences become increasingly pronounced for the amplitude and
timing of shortwave energy progressing across central/eastern
Canada into the northern U.S., affecting the front expected to
push eastward from the northern Plains. ECMWF runs continue to be
on the fast/amplified side with the upper trough and farthest east
with the cold front while among remaining guidance suggests recent
GFS runs could be too slow with height falls and the front. Latest
model/mean intermediate solution does slow the front a little and
provides reasonable leeway depending on how future runs may
cluster/trend. The new 12Z ECMWF has tempered the amplitude of its
upper shortwave. Behind this system, a blend/mean approach still
looks good for the West Coast trough as both the GFS and ECMWF
have varied among faster or slower timing over recent days and
medium to smaller scale shortwave uncertainties remain.

The last system to note is an area of low pressure expected to
form north of the Bahamas and track northward, off the East Coast.
The GFS had been the strongest with possible tropical development
of this system but it has been trending weaker over the past day.
Recent GFS/ECMWF trends have also been a bit more offshore. Other
guidance differs significantly for definition and path. A fair
degree of uncertainty persists for specifics of flow aloft
reaching the East Coast from late week into the weekend but the
majority scenario has enough westerly flow to push the system and
its rainfall away from most if not all of the Northeast. This
system requires close monitoring as minor changes could have
significant implications for any rain that may fall across an
already saturated coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Regardless of the exact strength of Nicholas at any particular
time, the system will bring a threat for heavy rain over portions
of southern/eastern Texas and Louisiana through at least the
middle of next week. Potential remains for some locations to see
10-15 inches while some guidance is suggesting that progression
will be slow enough to result in even higher totals. Also Nicholas
could maintain its definition long enough to support a heavy rain
threat beyond midweek--which would also lead to higher totals.
There is still significant uncertainty in the details so continue
to monitor latest forecasts closely, as the heavy rainfall may
produce flash and urban flooding, particularly for more sensitive
locations... urban regions and those areas that have already seen
above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

Mostly lighter rainfall will accompany frontal passages through
the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS. Some potential
exists for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts from the
Ohio Valley/eastern Great Lakes into the Northeast with a leading
front on Wednesday. Confidence is lower in how much rain may occur
with the next front in the series given model spread for timing
and waviness. A slower and more wavy front could produce heavier
rainfall over the Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes while
rainfall intensity would be less with a faster front. Meanwhile
moderate to locally heavy rainfall may reach the Pacific Northwest
late this week into the weekend with some snow possible in the
highest elevations of the Washington Cascades. Recent trends have
shown decreasing East Coast rainfall as the possible western
Atlantic system tracks a little farther offshore late in the week.

Evolution of the large scale pattern will favor cooler
temperatures settling over the West Coast states, with some highs
10-15F below normal over the Northwest by the end of the week/next
weekend, along with steadily increasing coverage of plus 10F and
greater anomalies for max/min readings over the Plains and
east-central U.S. Locations to the south of an initial
northeastern U.S. front will also see well above normal
temperatures from midweek onward. Any clouds/moisture with the
system forecast to track over the western Atlantic will be a wild
card with respect to high temperatures near the East Coast.

...Tropical Storm Nicholas Likely to Bring Heavy Rain to
Southern/Eastern Texas and Louisiana through the middle of next
week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The wave reaching the southwestern Gulf of Mexico has developed
sufficiently for the National Hurricane Center to start advisories
for Tropical Storm Nicholas. Based on the 15Z advisory Nicholas
should track generally northward in the short term, close to the
Texas coast by Monday-Tuesday, and reach southeastern Texas as a
tropical depression as of the start of the medium range period
early Wednesday. Expect Nicholas to bring a threat of heavy
rainfall to portions of southeastern Texas and Louisiana through
at least Wednesday and possibly beyond depending on how long the
system persists. GFS/ECMWF runs continue to show the best
definition and northward extent (though with the GFS straying to
the east side of the latest spread and the 00Z ECMWF slower than
the NHC forecast) but additional differences in other guidance
still keep confidence for specifics lower than desired.

Farther north the models and ensembles agree on the general
evolution toward a deepening mean trough aloft along the West
Coast late this week into the weekend while western
Atlantic/eastern U.S. ridging (or at least well above normal
heights) deflects the westerlies across the northern tier U.S. and
southern/eastern Canada.  Especially after early Thursday model
differences become increasingly pronounced for the amplitude and
timing of shortwave energy progressing across central/eastern
Canada into the northern U.S., affecting the front expected to
push eastward from the northern Plains. ECMWF runs continue to be
on the fast/amplified side with the upper trough and farthest east
with the cold front while among remaining guidance suggests recent
GFS runs could be too slow with height falls and the front. Latest
model/mean intermediate solution does slow the front a little and
provides reasonable leeway depending on how future runs may
cluster/trend. The new 12Z ECMWF has tempered the amplitude of its
upper shortwave. Behind this system, a blend/mean approach still
looks good for the West Coast trough as both the GFS and ECMWF
have varied among faster or slower timing over recent days and
medium to smaller scale shortwave uncertainties remain.

The last system to note is an area of low pressure expected to
form north of the Bahamas and track northward, off the East Coast.
The GFS had been the strongest with possible tropical development
of this system but it has been trending weaker over the past day.
Recent GFS/ECMWF trends have also been a bit more offshore. Other
guidance differs significantly for definition and path. A fair
degree of uncertainty persists for specifics of flow aloft
reaching the East Coast from late week into the weekend but the
majority scenario has enough westerly flow to push the system and
its rainfall away from most if not all of the Northeast. This
system requires close monitoring as minor changes could have
significant implications for any rain that may fall across an
already saturated coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun September 12 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0214 PM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

Elevated highlights were added to portions of the Great Basin for
tomorrow/Monday. A small mid-level perturbation will overspread the
region tomorrow afternoon, with adequate boundary-layer mixing
promoting widespread 15 mph west-southwesterly surface winds along
with 10-15% RH. Farther east, a couple of dry thunderstorms may
occur across portions of the central Rockies. However, fuels across
this region are modestly dry, and some of the storms may be
immediately preceded by appreciable rainfall accumulations from
earlier showers, serving to further dampen fuels. The sparse nature
of the dry strikes and relatively marginal fuel receptiveness to
fire spread precludes isolated dry thunderstorm highlights at this
time.

Otherwise, high-end Elevated meteorological conditions are still
expected across portions of the central/southern High Plains
tomorrow, as surface lee-troughing is slightly augmented by the
passage of a subtle mid-level perturbation. Latest guidance
consensus suggests south-southwesterly surface winds will reach
15-20 mph amid 15-25% RH across much of the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandles into western and Central Kansas for several hours
tomorrow afternoon. Some areas may even see 20+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds overlap with 15% RH by afternoon peak
heating, but the localized and brief nature of such conditions atop
modestly receptive fuels precludes Critical highlights at this time.

..Squitieri.. 09/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0118 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Monday, a gusty southerly flow is expected across the TX/OK
Panhandles into western Oklahoma and southwest Kansas as the
pressure gradient tightens across the southern Plains. Increasing
moisture is expected across much of Oklahoma, and therefore, the
drier surface airmass is expected to shift farther northwest. Winds
of 15 to 20 mph are forecast with relative humidity between 10 and
15 percent from the northern Texas Panhandle into southwest Kansas.

A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms may be possible across Colorado,
Wyoming, and eastern Utah on Monday. However, the driest storms are
expected to be where fuels are only marginally dry from recent
rainfall, and where Sunday rainfall may further improve fuel
conditions. Therefore, no isolated dry thunderstorm area is
warranted at this time.

Valid 00Z Mon Sep 13 2021 - 00Z Wed Sep 15 2021

...Tropical Storm Nicholas to threaten the Texas coastline, as
well as southwest Louisiana, with heavy rain and gusty winds
beginning as early as Monday morning...

...Excessive heat found across the Southwest with above average
temperatures located from the Central Plains to the Ohio Valley
and Mid-Atlantic...

...Severe weather possible for portions of the Lower Great Lakes
and Northeast through Monday, as well as the central High Plains
this evening...

Tropical Storm Nicholas officially formed in the Bay of Campeche
earlier this morning and is forecast to continue moving
north-northwest over the next couple of days and eventually
approach the western Gulf Coast. As it does so, heavy rain ahead
of the system may lead to isolated instances of flash flooding
between southern Louisiana and much of the Texas coastline this
evening. As Nicholas draws closer to southern Texas on Monday,
additional round of heavy rain and increasing winds are forecast
across the lower and middle Texas Coast. By Tuesday, impacts are
expected to expand into the upper Texas Coast and southwest
Louisiana. Upwards of 20 inches of rain is possible across parts
of the Texas coastline through the middle of the week, with
widespread amounts between southern Texas and southwest Louisiana
around 5 to 10 inches. Rainfall amounts of this magnitude will
likely lead to areas of flash flooding, with considerable flash
flood events possible. To highlight the concern, a Moderate Risk
(level 3/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued for Monday and
Tuesday between the lower Texas Coast and southwest Louisiana.

Elsewhere, an expansive dome of upper-level high pressure
stretching across the southern two-thirds of the U.S. mainland
allows for abnormally hot conditions to continue, with the heat
encompassing a broad area from the Southwest and Midwest to the
Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will be as high as 15 to 20 degrees
above normal with the greatest concentration of these anomalously
hot conditions stretching from the central Plains to the
Mid-Atlantic through Tuesday. Excessive Heat Warnings remains in
place for parts of southwest Arizona and the Lower Colorado River
Valley for both today and Monday as highs reach close to 110F.
Generally the coolest temperatures are likely to be confined to
the Pacific Northwest and the northern Plains in wake of a pair of
cold frontal passages crossing the region.

A cold front crossing the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains
will be associated with an upper-level trough, which is expected
to gradually break down the aforementioned ridge of high pressure
over of the southern two-thirds of the nation by mid-week. As this
occurs, an elongated frontal zone with several waves of low
pressure advancing along it will be the catalyst for scattered
areas of heavy showers and thunderstorms. This will impact a broad
area from the central and northern Plains through the Midwest and
into the Northeast. Some localized severe weather is possible as
the Storm Prediction Center does have a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of
severe weather currently depicted for this evening across southern
New York and eastern Michigan, with a Slight Risk also in effect
for Monday from northern Pennsylvania to northern New Jersey. The
potential for severe weather is also highlighted in eastern
Colorado through early Monday. Severe storms may contain damaging
winds and large hail, along with locally heavy rainfall rates that
may lead to some instances of flash flooding.

...Heavy Rain From Tropical Storm Nicholas May Continue Into
Thursday...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Weak flow around Nicholas may allow heavy rain from the system/its
remnants to continue over portions of the western Gulf Coast into
Thursday but the system is expected to be absorbed/dissipated by
late in the week. Follow the National Hurricane Center advisory
products for the latest information on Nicholas.

General agreement among 12Z global deterministic/18Z GFS of a deep
central Canadian low shifting east with the next low/trough
approaching the Pacific Northwest Saturday. The 12Z ECMWF diverges
from consensus and its ensemble mean with a much less amplified
wave than the GFS/CMC and the ensemble means by Day 5. There is
decent ensemble mean agreement particularly with the 18Z GEFS and
12Z ECENS means Days 5-7 with the deepening mean trough aloft
along the West Coast late this week into the weekend while western
Atlantic/eastern U.S. ridging (or at least well above normal
heights) deflects the westerlies across the northern tier U.S. and
southern/eastern Canada.

Another feature to note is a wave/weak area of low pressure
possibly forming north of the Bahamas by Thursday and track
northward, off the East Coast. The 18Z GFS remains the strongest
with possible tropical development of this system with great
divergence in overall guidance. A fair degree of uncertainty
persists for specifics of flow aloft reaching the East Coast from
late week into the weekend but the majority scenario has enough
westerly flow to push the system and its rainfall away from most
if not all of the Northeast. This system requires close monitoring
as minor changes could have significant implications for any rain
that may fall across an already saturated coastal
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Nicholas could maintain its definition long enough to support a
heavy rain threat through mid to late week, though there is
uncertainty in the eventual track of the system, how long it will
maintain tropical characteristics and heavy rainfall threat before
becoming absorbed into the weak flow and dissipate. Continue to
monitor the latest NHC advisory products.

Remnants of Nicholas may allow some enhanced rainfall over the
eastern US depending on the track of the remnants and the
associated plume of tropical moisture. Mostly lighter rainfall
looks to accompany frontal passages through the central parts of
the CONUS through this weekend. With the next frontal progression,
a slower and more wavy front could produce heavier rainfall over
the Upper Mississippi Valley/Great Lakes while rainfall intensity
would be less with a faster front. Meanwhile moderate to locally
heavy rainfall looks to reach the Pacific Northwest Friday into
the weekend with some snow possible in the highest elevations of
the Washington Cascades.

Evolution of the large scale pattern will favor cooler
temperatures settling over the West Coast states, with some highs
10-15F below normal over the Northwest by the end of the week/next
weekend, along with steadily increasing coverage of plus 10F and
greater anomalies for max/min readings over the Plains and
east-central U.S. Locations to the south of an initial
northeastern U.S. front will also see well above normal
temperatures from midweek onward. Any clouds/moisture with the
system forecast to track over the western Atlantic will be a wild
card with respect to high temperatures near the East Coast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
...TX/OK Panhandles into central Kansas...
A surface low, currently in southwest Kansas early this morning is
forecast to deepen through the day as a weak shortwave trough
traverses the central Rockies. This will tighten the pressure
gradient across the southern Plains with 15 to 20 mph expected
across the TX/OK Panhandles into central Kansas. Some gusts up to 25
mph may be possible in central Kansas. Deep mixing should keep
dewpoints low in this region with relative humidity between 15 and
20 percent during the afternoon. Therefore, despite only moderately
dry fuels (85% ERC), an elevated delineation is warranted.

...Southern Nevada into far northwest Arizona and southwest Utah...
A combination of deep mixing and downslope flow is expected to lead
to dry and breezy conditions across portions of southern Nevada into
southwest Utah and far northwest Arizona with winds around 15 to 20
mph and afternoon relative humidity 8 to 12 percent. Some dry and
breezy conditions may extend farther south and east into northern
Arizona and southern Utah, but monsoon precipitation has brought
significant fuel moisture to much of this region.

...Snake River Plain...
Cyclonic mid-level flow around 30 to 35 mph is forecast to align
parallel to the Snake River Plain in southern Idaho. Deep boundary
layer mixing is expected as temperatures warm into the upper 70s.
This mixing should bring some of this stronger flow to the surface
this afternoon with winds of 15 to 20 mph expected and relative
humidity of 10 to 15 percent.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0209 AM CDT Mon Sep 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Weak high pressure is forecast across much of the Northwest,
Northern Rockies, Great Basin, and central Rockies through the
period. A thermally induced pressure trough will be present across
California as temperatures warm into the upper 90s to near 100 in
the central Valley. Winds are expected to remain light across most
of the western CONUS with moist conditions across much of the East.
Fire weather concerns are expected to remain mostly low on Tuesday
as a result of these weak winds across dry portions of the West.

...Tropical Storm Nicholas to produce torrential rainfall, strong
winds, and high surf from the Texas coast to southern Louisiana
with life-threatening storm surge and flooding possible; High Risk
of Excessive Rainfall near the Upper Texas Coast today...

...A hotter than normal mid-September in store across most of the
mainland U.S, Excessive Heat Warnings issued in parts of the
Southwest....

...Severe weather possible from the Central Plains to the Great
Lakes and Northeast; Elevated Risks for fire weather in parts of
the West...

Tropical Storm Nicholas continues to track north towards the Texas
coast with landfall likely to occur somewhere between Corpus
Christi and Galveston Bay Monday evening. Some rain bands out
ahead of Nicholas have already reached the Texas coast with an
increasingly widespread area of rainfall expected to arrive as
Nicholas inches closer to land later today. The Weather Prediction
Center (WPC) has issued a High Risk for Excessive Rainfall for a
small portion of the Upper Texas Coast, highlighting just how
significant the threat for flash flooding could become later
today. Nicholas is set to generate tropical storm force winds
along the coast as well as battering surf and dangerous storm
surge. That said, the storms slow progressing over the Upper Texas
coast and into southern Louisiana means rounds of torrential
rainfall, day after day, is anticipated for these areas. WPC's
latest Excessive Rainfall Outlook features a remarkable three
straight days worth of Moderate Risks (level 3/4) for portions of
the Texas coast and southern Louisiana. Localized totals of up to
20 inches of rain is possible across parts of the Texas and
Louisiana coastlines through the mid-week, with widespread amounts
between southern Texas and southwest Louisiana around 5 to 10
inches. Rainfall amounts of this magnitude will likely lead to
areas of flash flooding that could be life-threatening where the
heaviest totals and highest rainfall rates transpire.

Temperature-wise, a mid-September heat wave focused in the
Southwest and Central Plains the last couple days extends its
reach into the Mid-Atlantic today. The hottest conditions are
centered in the Desert Southwest where Excessive Heat Warnings
remain in place through Monday afternoon. The central High Plains
will sweat out one more day of abnormally hot conditions (highs
coming close to hitting triple digits in spots) but a passing cold
front brings some relief from the heat on Tuesday. The late season
summer heat only continues to build in the Mid-Atlantic with high
temps in the low 90s and very mild morning lows for mid-September.
In fact, some parts of the Ohio Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic
could break daily record warm lows this morning. Abnormally cool
conditions are likely in parts of the Deep South thanks to
widespread cloud cover from Tropical Storm Nicholas. The Pacific
Northwest can also expect seasonally cooler temps today and again
on Wednesday as another Pacific cold front sweeps through the
region.

Tropical Storm Nicholas is not the only active weather maker in
the Lower 48. An elongated frontal boundary working in tandem with
an emerging wave of low pressure out of the central Rockies will
act as a catalyst for scattered areas of heavy showers and
thunderstorms from the Upper Midwest to the interior Northeast.
Some severe weather is possible as the Storm Prediction Center
does have a pair of Slight Risks (level 2/5) in place fore parts
of the Midwest and northern Mid-Atlantic today. As the wave of low
pressure in the Plains ejects east towards the Great Lakes on
Tuesday, the best odds for severe weather takes shape once again
in the Midwest as the cold front swings through the region. Severe
storms may contain damaging winds and large hail, along with
locally heavy rainfall rates that may lead to some instances of
flash flooding. Lastly, fire weather conditions remain problematic
in parts of the West as a few Elevated Risk areas have been issued
in parts of the central High Plains, the Great Basin, and Snake
River Valley.

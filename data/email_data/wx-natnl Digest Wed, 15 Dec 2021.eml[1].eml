Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1055 AM CST Tue Dec 14 2021

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLES...FAR SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO AND FAR SOUTHWESTERN
KANSAS...

The Critical area was expanded slightly west-northwestward into far
southeastern CO and far southwestern KS based on the latest surface
observations and multi-model consensus. Similar to areas farther
east (TX and OK Panhandles), a couple hours of low-end Critical
fire-weather conditions will be possible this afternoon -- aided by
boundary-layer winds of 25-30 mph and 10-15 percent RH. These
conditions will be further exacerbated by ongoing drought and highly
receptive fuels. The remainder of the outlook appears to be on
track.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1249 AM CST Tue Dec 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A vigorous mid-level shortwave trough will quickly progress across
the Interior West today, promoting rapid deepening of a surface
low/lee trough across High Plains during the afternoon. Dry and
breezy southwesterly surface conditions will develop across the
southern High Plains, promoting some potential for wildfire spread.
15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds are expected to
coincide with widespread 20 percent RH by afternoon peak heating for
at least a couple of hours, from eastern Colorado into the Texas
Panhandle. Elevated highlights have been maintained where these
favorable conditions will overspread very dry fuels that are quite
receptive to wildfire growth. Low-end critical highlights have been
maintained across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, where confidence
remains in RH dropping to 15 percent for a couple of hours.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest guidance and the ensemble means are in fairly good
agreement initially and through most of the extended period, thus
leading to an above average confidence with this forecast. The WPC
medium range product suite was primarily comprised of a blend of
the 12Z CMC/ECWMF/GFS/UKMET and the NAEFS, GEFS and EC ensemble
means. The inclusion of the means increased during the middle and
later periods. The ensemble support was also strong and WPC
product continuity was well maintained. These models solutions
diverge more significantly early next week for Days 6/7 with the
timing/amplitude of embedded systems, but most notably with the
multi-stream flow over the East/Western Atlantic where the GFS
develops a major coastal low while the ECMWF suppresses
development.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A strong surface low pressure system will be lifting north through
eastern Canada/Canadian Maritimes Thursday and Friday, with its
associated trailing frontal boundary draped across the
Mid-Atlantic to the Desert Southwest. Showers and thunderstorms
along this slow moving boundary is expected to be moderate to
heavy at times, which may lead to excessive rainfall and localized
flooding concerns from the Southern Plains through the
Mid-South/Ohio Valley. Well to the south, upper ridging should
support some record warm temperatures ahead of the attendant cold
front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F shifting
southward over the East to the South/Southeast into Friday and
Saturday.

A developing frontal low will bring a swath of wintry
precipitation from the Great Lake states through northern New
England into the weekend as the trailing enhanced rainfall axis
drops southward across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as cooling
high pressure builds across the Plains and to the East. Some of
the guidance is suggesting that by early next week this feature
may spin up and track up the East Coast; potentially yielding
maritime threats, spreading rain near the Mid-Atlantic and
possibly snow for the Northeast.

Meanwhile, moisture surging onshore the West Coast is causing
moderate precipitation across the Northwest and into California
ahead of an approaching Pacific system; which is expected to
gradually weaken into Friday. Moisture from another Pacific system
may then impact the Pacific Northwest with moderate to possibly
locally heavy precipitation amounts into the weekend, with
additional energies digging southward over the eastern Pacific
early next week that would eventually affect California.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CST Tue Dec 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR NORTHERN PARTS OF
THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...AND PORTIONS OF
WESTERN INTO CENTRAL KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO
INTO SOUTHEAST COLORADO...FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...AND MUCH OF
WESTERN INTO CENTRAL KANSAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, and only minor adjustments
were made with this update. The Elevated, Critical, and Extremely
Critical areas were all expanded slightly northward based on the
latest high-resolution guidance consensus. In addition, the Elevated
area was extended westward into the I-25 corridor, where a couple
hours of very strong winds, low RH, and highly receptive fuels will
support an initial wildfire-spread threat. Farther south across
parts of southeastern NM, localized Elevated to Critical conditions
will be possible in the lee of the higher terrain, though the
localized nature of the threat precludes delineations at this time.
For additional details on the central and southern Great Plains
fire-weather threat, see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/14/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CST Tue Dec 14 2021/

...Synopsis...
A volatile fire weather day is expected across portions of the
central Plains for tomorrow/Wednesday. A potent mid-level shortwave
trough will eject into the Plains states, with a 110+ kt mid-level
jet streak overspreading the central High Plains during the
afternoon hours. Rapid surface low intensification (perhaps to 990
mb) will ensue as the low surges towards the Upper Mississippi
Valley. Some of the latest guidance depicts a 75 kt 850 mb jet
accompanying this surface low, which will also overspread a mixing
boundary layer during the afternoon. As such, gradient flow and
downward momentum transport will encourage dangerously windy/dry
surface conditions atop extremely dry fuels, with ERCs reaching the
98th percentile in spots.

Extremely Critical highlights have been introduced for the far
northern Texas Panhandle into western and Central Kansas, where
guidance consensus depicts widespread 30+ mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 10-15 percent RH for at
least a few hours. Given the boundary layer mixing of the strong LLJ
winds only a few hundred feet above the ground, 45+ mph sustained
winds may occur in a few spots, especially in west-central or
southwest Kansas. Surrounding the Extremely Critical delineation,
Critical/Elevated highlights have been introduced where widespread
20+ mph sustained west-southwesterly winds are expected to overlap
with 15-20 percent RH for a few hours tomorrow afternoon.

...Flash flooding risk continues over southern California as a
moderately strong atmospheric river delivers more heavy rain
today...

...Widespread heavy snowfall to persist over the western U.S.
through Thursday...

...A deep low pressure system developing on Wednesday is forecast
to generate high winds from the Southwest to the Upper Midwest
where severe weather will also be possible...

...Record breaking heat to impact the central/eastern U.S. through
Thursday...

...Critical to Extreme Fire Weather risk for parts of the
Central/Southern Plains through Thursday...

During the short range period a flurry of activity is expected
over the CONUS starting with a moderately strong atmospheric river
presently guiding a significant amount of moisture into southern
California. At lower elevations 2-6" of additional rainfall are
expected through Wednesday morning generating flooding concerns
for the area, particularly over the Bobcat burn scar. Given the
potential for flash flooding in the highly urbanized Los Angeles
and San Diego metro areas and debris flows over burn scarred
areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for portions of southern California through
Wednesday morning. At higher elevations the intense influx of
moisture will result in heavy snowfall accumulations from the
Sierra Nevada to the Rockies. Snowfall rates of 2-3"/hr will be
possible over the Sierra, where an additional 1-3 ft of snow are
expected to accumulate in the 24 hour period from Tuesday morning
to Wednesday morning. Through Wednesday night an additional 12+"
will likely accumulate in the mountain ranges of the Central Great
Basin and Northern/Central Rockies as the moisture interacts with
a draping cold front progressing through the regions. To account
for the minor to moderate impacts associated with this event a
menagerie of Winter Storm Watches and Warnings as well as Winter
Weather Advisories are currently in effect from the West Coast
through the Rockies. Without skipping a beat another round of
heavy snow will affect the Sierra Nevada and neighboring Cascades
as a Pacific system makes its way onshore Wednesday afternoon.
Snowfall accumulations of 8-12" with isolated higher amounts are
expected with lesser totals likely further inland.

Further east, a deep low pressure system is expected to develop
over the Northern High Plains Wednesday morning in association
with a cut off low aloft and the aforementioned draping cold front
at the surface. At the same time the system is deepening high
pressure is forecast to build immediately to the west, resulting
in the development of a very tight pressure gradient over the
Rockies. This tightening of the pressure gradient will generate
strong winds with gusts up to and in excess of 75 mph in some
areas. As the system progresses eastward it is forecast to deepen
further, allowing the blustery winds to continue to blow all the
way to the Upper Midwest. Because these strong winds could blow
down trees and power lines as well as make travel difficult, High
Wind Watches and Warnings as well as Wind Advisories have been put
into effect from the Desert Southwest to the Upper Midwest. In
addition to the high winds this system is expected pull moisture
north from the Gulf of Mexico, bringing a mix of rain and snow to
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as well as showers and
thunderstorms from the Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley.
Favorable environmental conditions ahead of the low pressure
system will support the development of severe thunderstorms over
portions of the Upper Midwest. Given the potential for these
storms to generate damaging wind gusts as well as a few tornadoes,
the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms over portions of southern Minnesota and northern
Iowa effective Wednesday morning through Thursday morning. By
Wednesday night, surface instability ahead of the system will
allow for some snow to fall over interior New England before
switching over to freezing rain Thursday morning then finally rain
Thursday night with the passage of a warm front.

High pressure settled both aloft and at the surface over the
eastern U.S. will serve to push warm, tropical air northward into
the central and eastern U.S. throughout much of the period. This
warm air advection will allow daily high temperatures to skyrocket
to over 30 degrees above average on Wednesday throughout the
Plains and Mississippi Valley. With spring-like highs anywhere
from the 50s and 70s in the forecast, over 50 daily high records
stand to be broken on Wednesday. As this warm air is pushed
eastward ahead of the deep low pressure system on Thursday, more
modest temperature departures of 20 to 30 degrees above normal are
expected to extend from the Southern Plains to the Northeast,
where an additional 45 daily high temperature records will be put
to the test.

Elsewhere in the Central/Southern Plains, abnormally high
temperatures, very strong winds, extremely dry fuels, and low
relative humidity levels are all forecast to coincide over the
next few days, producing highly favorable conditions for the
spread of wildfires. To highlight these dangerous conditions the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Critical Risk of Fire Weather
for much of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles through Wednesday
morning. Additionally, an Extremely Critical Risk of Fire Weather
has been issued for Wednesday morning through Thursday morning
from the northern Texas Panhandle through central Kansas which is
surrounded by a Critical Risk area from northeastern New Mexico to
southern Nebraska.

...Flash flooding risk continues over southern California as a
moderately strong atmospheric river delivers more heavy rain
today...

...Widespread heavy snowfall to persist over the western U.S.
through Thursday...

...A deep low pressure system developing on Wednesday is forecast
to generate high winds from the Southwest to the Upper Midwest
where severe weather will also be possible...

...Record breaking heat to impact the central/eastern U.S. through
Thursday...

...Critical to Extreme Fire Weather risk for parts of the
Central/Southern Plains through Thursday...

During the short range period a flurry of activity is expected
over the CONUS starting with a moderately strong atmospheric river
presently guiding a significant amount of moisture into southern
California. At lower elevations 2-6" of additional rainfall are
expected through Wednesday morning generating flooding concerns
for the area, particularly over the Bobcat burn scar. Given the
potential for flash flooding in the highly urbanized Los Angeles
and San Diego metro areas and debris flows over burn scarred
areas, the Weather Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of
Excessive Rainfall for portions of southern California through
Wednesday morning. At higher elevations the intense influx of
moisture will result in heavy snowfall accumulations from the
Sierra Nevada to the Rockies. Snowfall rates of 2-3"/hr will be
possible over the Sierra, where an additional 1-3 ft of snow are
expected to accumulate in the 24 hour period from Tuesday morning
to Wednesday morning. Through Wednesday night an additional 12+"
will likely accumulate in the mountain ranges of the Central Great
Basin and Northern/Central Rockies as the moisture interacts with
a draping cold front progressing through the regions. To account
for the minor to moderate impacts associated with this event a
menagerie of Winter Storm Watches and Warnings as well as Winter
Weather Advisories are currently in effect from the West Coast
through the Rockies. Without skipping a beat another round of
heavy snow will affect the Sierra Nevada and neighboring Cascades
as a Pacific system makes its way onshore Wednesday afternoon.
Snowfall accumulations of 8-12" with isolated higher amounts are
expected with lesser totals likely further inland.

Further east, a deep low pressure system is expected to develop
over the Northern High Plains Wednesday morning in association
with a cut off low aloft and the aforementioned draping cold front
at the surface. At the same time the system is deepening high
pressure is forecast to build immediately to the west, resulting
in the development of a very tight pressure gradient over the
Rockies. This tightening of the pressure gradient will generate
strong winds with gusts up to and in excess of 75 mph in some
areas. As the system progresses eastward it is forecast to deepen
further, allowing the blustery winds to continue to blow all the
way to the Upper Midwest. Because these strong winds could blow
down trees and power lines as well as make travel difficult, High
Wind Watches and Warnings as well as Wind Advisories have been put
into effect from the Desert Southwest to the Upper Midwest. In
addition to the high winds this system is expected pull moisture
north from the Gulf of Mexico, bringing a mix of rain and snow to
the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest as well as showers and
thunderstorms from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes.
Favorable environmental conditions ahead of the low pressure
system will support the development of severe thunderstorms over
portions of the Upper Midwest. Given the potential for these
storms to generate damaging wind gusts as well as a few tornadoes,
the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms over portions of southern Minnesota and northern
Iowa effective Wednesday morning through Thursday morning. By
Wednesday night, surface instability ahead of the system will
allow for some snow to fall over interior New England before
switching over to freezing rain Thursday morning then finally rain
Thursday night with the passage of a warm front.

High pressure settled both aloft and at the surface over the
eastern U.S. will serve to push warm, tropical air northward into
the central and eastern U.S. throughout much of the period. This
warm air advection will allow daily high temperatures to skyrocket
to over 30 degrees above average on Wednesday throughout the
Plains and Mississippi Valley. With spring-like highs anywhere
from the 50s and 70s in the forecast, over 50 daily high records
stand to be broken on Wednesday. As this warm air is pushed
eastward ahead of the deep low pressure system on Thursday, more
modest temperature departures of 20 to 30 degrees above normal are
expected to extend from the Southern Plains to the Northeast where
an additional 45 daily high temperature records will be put to the
test.

Elsewhere in the Central/Southern Plains, abnormally high
temperatures, very strong winds, extremely dry fuels, and low
relative humidity levels are all forecast to coincide over the
next few days, producing highly favorable conditions for the
spread of wildfires. To highlight these dangerous conditions the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Critical Risk of Fire Weather
for much of the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles through Wednesday
morning. Additionally, an Extremely Critical Risk of Fire Weather
has been issued for Wednesday morning through Thursday morning
from the northern Texas Panhandle through central Kansas, which is
surrounded by a Critical Risk area from northeastern New Mexico to
southern Nebraska.

FOR WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 22 - TUESDAY DECEMBER 28: There is good agreement am=
ong
the dynamical models featuring highly amplified ridging over the northern
Pacific, with downstream negative height departures over the eastern Pacifi=
c
and into the western and north-central CONUS. Compared to yesterday, this
morning's 0z GEFS has come into better agreement with the ECMWF and Canadia=
n
ensembles showing more amplified troughing over the western U.S. early in t=
he
period. At the surface, ensemble guidance favors the persistence of a broad
area of surface high pressure over western Canada, which is expected to adv=
ect
anomalous cold air into the northwestern and north-central CONUS during the
period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict a broad region from the
Pacific Northwest to the Upper Mississippi Valley of at least a 20% chance =
of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below freezing,
thus
a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is issued for the entirety =
of
week-2. Higher probabilities (>40%) for minimum temperatures falling below =
the
15th percentile and below 0 degrees F are indicated along the Canadian bord=
er
region extending from Montana to North Dakota during the middle of the peri=
od,
supporting the continuation of moderate risk of much below normal temperatu=
res
from Dec 24 to 27 for the region.



Compared to yesterday, a notable change in the 500-hPa height anomaly patte=
rn
concerns a slight retrogression of the amplified ridge/trough pattern over =
the
Pacific, where both the 0z ECMWF and 0z GEFS ensembles show a more westward
solution of the mean trough axis. Additionally, these ensemble runs also fa=
vor
stronger anomalous mid-level ridging over the southwestern CONUS which look=
s
to
lower the potential for much below normal temperatures over portions of the
West Coast. This is reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool, which no longer
depicts increased probabilities for minimum temperatures falling below the
15th
percentile over California and the Great Basin, relative to yesterday. Whil=
e
below-normal temperatures remain predominantly favored, there is lower
confidence of anomalous cold impacting these parts of the West given the
mid-level height trend. Therefore,d the corresponding slight risk area is
removed in the outlook. Despite this change, the enhanced onshore flow
forecast
still remains a key hazards factor, where there is good support in the
uncalibrated raw ensembles and calibrated reforecast tools indicating an
elevated heavy precipitation potential for the West Coast states by the out=
set
of the period. A moderate risk for heavy precipitation remains issued for
central and southern California for Dec 22-26, and a broader slight risk ar=
ea
is posted for all of week-2 extending from southern California into the
Pacific
Northwest where reforecast guidance now shows higher chances for 3-day amou=
nts
exceeding 2 inches throughout the period.



As supported by the latest deterministic and ensemble mean solutions, there=
 is
also an elevated potential for high elevation snowfall across much of the
western U.S. A moderate risk of heavy snow is posted for the Sierra Nevadas=
 of
northern and central California for Dec 22-26, and a broader slight risk ar=
ea
is posted extending northward into the Cascades of the Pacific Northwest fo=
r
the entirety of week-2. A slight risk of heavy snow is also issued across t=
he
Bitterroot mountain range of the Northern Rockies for week-2, where there i=
s
increased support in today's guidance for snowfall totals reaching hazard
thresholds.The overall increase in available moisture across the West durin=
g
week-2 is expected to help the ongoing drought recovery (much of California=
 is
still registering D3 to D4 conditions); however, enhanced precipitation may
trigger localized flooding in the lower elevation areas and may also lead t=
o
added travel difficulties during the upcoming holidays.  Lastly, strong
surface
pressure gradients featured in the ensembles as well as elevated chances fo=
r
sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF reforecast tool
throughout much of the West supports the addition of slight risk of high wi=
nds
in the outlook.



Across the southern and eastern CONUS, persistent mid-level ridging is like=
ly
to lead to a relatively drier and warmer pattern during week-2. Ensembles
continue to feature mean surface low formation late next week across the Gr=
eat
Plains and Mississippi Valley which may lead to above-normal and possible
heavy
precipitation over the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys with Gulf of Mexico retur=
n
flow favored during the middle of the period. However, raw uncalibrated
precipitation amounts remain fairly tenuous, and with little to no support =
of
heavy precipitation potential in the reforecast tools, no related
precipitation
hazards are issued. Over the higher latitudes of eastern North America, mod=
els
have been also been signaling a retrogression of strong positive height
departures over Greenland, where there in an increasing potential for block=
ing
and a negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) pattern taking shape that
would
favor a transition towards colder temperatures over the eastern CONUS later=
 in
December. While models have trended more towards favoring below normal
temperatures in the northeastern CONUS during week-2, there remains little
support for minimum temperatures reaching hazard thresholds over this part =
of
the country, precluding any corresponding temperatures hazards at this time
but
this region will continue to be monitored in upcoming outlooks.



Outside of the lower 48, models continue to favor broad mid-level troughing
underneath the aforementioned highly amplified ridging in the northern Paci=
fic
during week-2. This height pattern is expected to support periods of
above-normal precipitation over the central Pacific, where reforecast tools
show increased chances of precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th
percentile over parts of Hawaii early in the period. A continuation of
above-normal and possibly heavy precipitation over the Hawaii islands may
worsen already saturated soils due to antecedent rainfall over the Hawaii
islands since early December.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned ridge / trough pattern over the northern
Pacific is expected to bring anomalously cold temperatures, with an increas=
ed
likelihood much below normal temperatures over the southeastern Mainland an=
d
Panhandle compared to yesterday's guidance. Reforecast tools indicate at le=
ast
a 60% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile acro=
ss
portions of the lower Panhandle, thus a corresponding high risk area for mu=
ch
below normal temperatures is added to today's outlook from Dec 24 to 26.  A
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures remains posted and is expan=
ded
to the Yakutat region of the Panhandle from Dec 23 to 27, and a broader sli=
ght
risk area remains issued and now extends from the Kenai Peninsula through t=
he
Panhandle for the entirety of week-2.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 20 - 24 2021

There is very good agreement among the dynamical models regarding an amplif=
ied
500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain. A very high
amplitude ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are foreca=
st
over the North Pacific extending northward into the Bering Sea. There is a
slight retrogression of this ridge relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day
forecasts.
A high amplitude trough is forecast from western Canada into the Pacific Oc=
ean
near the coast of the CONUS by all recent ensemble model solutions. Ridging
and
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast from parts of the Southwest
across the Southern and Central Plains and much of the East, excluding New
England and parts of New York State.

Above normal temperatures are favored over the Aleutians and most of northe=
rn
and western Mainland Alaska under the predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored for southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow. Be=

d
Central Plains, the Ohio Valley, and the Southeast, under a predicted ridge=
.
Below normal temperatures are favored for most of New England under negativ=
e
500-hPa height anomalies.

Onshore flow favors above normal precipitation for northern Mainland Alaska=
,
although precipitation anomalies are predicted to be small. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the south coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle
under anomalous northerly flow ahead of the ridge. Above normal precipitati=
on
is favored for most of the western third of the CONUS, as well as for parts=
 of
the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, ahead of an amplified
trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Southern
and Central Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley, supported by the
precipitation
consolidation tool. Near normal precipitation is favored for most of the
eastern CONUS, with greater uncertainty among the precipitation tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good model agreement on the circulation forecast over North America, a=
nd
good agreement among the temperature tools, offset by some disagreement amo=
ng
the precipitation tools, especially over the eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 22 - 28 2021

A similar 500-hPa flow pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is predicted=
 to
continue into week 2 with some amplification of the predicted trough near t=
he
Pacific coast of the CONUS. Ridging over the Bering Sea is predicted to
amplify
in week 2, such that flow is increasingly northerly across much of Alaska. =
The
ridge over the south-central and southeast CONUS is predicted to amplify
slightly in the week 2 period, while negative 500-hPa height anomalies
increase
in magnitude over the Northeast.

Above normal temperatures are favored for the Aleutians under a large posit=
ive
500-hPa height anomaly, while near normal temperatures are favored over muc=
h
of
northern and western Mainland Alaska under increasingly northerly flow, and
increased uncertainty among temperature tools for week 2. Below normal
temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow. Under the amplifying trough and
negative 500-hPa height anomalies, below normal temperature probabilities a=
re
enhanced over the far western CONUS and across the northern tier into the
Upper
Mississippi Valley. Probabilities exceed 60 percent for parts of the Pacifi=
c
Northwest and Northern Plains. Above normal temperatures are likely for mos=
t
of
the remaining areas of the CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies,
with
probabilities exceeding 60 percent over a large part of the south-central
CONUS. Near normal temperatures are favored for the northern Great Lakes
region, where predicted heights are near normal, while below normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the Northeast under negative 500-hPa
height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored for much of the
northern Alaska Mainland in week 2. However, precipitation is expected to
decrease as the ridge retrogresses westward. Below normal precipitation is
favored for the southern Alaska Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, under
anomalous northerly flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for the
western
third of the CONUS, with probabilities exceeding 60 percent in some areas o=
f
California and Nevada, as the trough is predicted to amplify. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored for parts of the Northern Plains and much=
 of
the Midwest, while below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the
Southern and Central Plains, the Gulf Coast region, and the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic coasts, supported by the consolidation of calibrated ECMWF and
GEFS precipitation forecasts.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 5% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=

due to very good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa circulation pattern, and
good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools over most of t=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles remain in good agreement this weekend into
Mon in a pattern with above average forecast confidence and
continuity. Forecast spread and continuity issues become
increasingly evident with the timing of embedded weather features
and stream interactions next week. The WPC medium range product
suite was primarily comprised of a blend of best clustered
solutions from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and the 12 UTC ECWMF/ECMWF
ensemble mean. Blend weighting favors the models this weekend
before transition to mainly the compatible ensemble means next
week amid growing system uncertainty and run to run variances.
WPC preferred guidance and latest 00 UTC runs overall have
suppressed southward to off the Southeast a threat for coastal low
genesis early-mid next week.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A developing frontal low has potential to bring a swath of
plowable snow as enhanced by terrain from the upper OH Valley
through especially the interior Northeast this weekend. An
enhanced rainfall focus with the trailing front will meanwhile
sink across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as post-frontal cooling
high pressure builds across the Plains and to the East. Guidance
has been inconsistent with the prospect of subsequent frontal wave
developments and coastal low genesis early next week up the East
Coast in part from northern stream energies and/or with latest
guidance trends now favoring ejection of a separated southern
stream trough that leads to southward suppressed wet lows from the
Gulf to offshore the Southeast.

Well upstream, dynamic but progressive upper trough and surface
system passage will build moisture to support moderate to terrain
enhanced heavy precipitation over the Northwest this weekend.
Amplified upper trough digging over the eastern Pacific early-mid
next week in the wake of this system offers potential to focus
ingredients for moderate to heavy precipitation into north-central
CA with slow system approach.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...AND MUCH OF WESTERN INTO
CENTRAL KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...EASTERN COLORADO INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...FAR SOUTHERN
NEBRASKA...AND MUCH OF KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
Very dangerous wildfire-spread conditions are still expected for
portions of the central Plains today. A 110 kt mid-level jet streak
accompanying a potent mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the
central Plains as an intense surface low quickly ejects into the
Upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon. An impressive vertical wind
profile will accompany the passing low, with widespread 60+ kt
low-level flow (just a few hundred feet above the ground) coinciding
with a mixing boundary layer. Gradient surface flow associated with
this intense low, combined with vertical mixing, will support very
windy and dry conditions atop critically dry fuels (90-98th
percentile ERCs) to support very rapid grassfire spread.

From late morning into mid afternoon, a few hours of widespread 35+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds will overlap with
10-15 percent RH. Extremely Critical fire weather highlights remain
in place where confidence is highest in very windy/dry conditions
persisting longer than 3 hours, and where patchy areas of 40+ mph
sustained winds are more likely. East of the Extremely Critical
delineation, high-end Critical to locally Extremely Critical
conditions are likely.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Modest surface lee-troughing is expected across the central High
Plains tomorrow/Thursday as a mid-level trough impinges on the Rocky
Mountains. Locally Elevated conditions are most likely during the
afternoon, with patchy areas of 15-20 mph sustained southerly winds
coinciding with 20-25 percent RH across northeast New Mexico into
eastern Colorado and far western Kansas. While fuels are expected to
remain extremely dry across the region, confidence in a more
favorable surface wind/RH overlap remains too low to add Elevated
highlights this outlook.

...There is a Moderate Risk of Severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley through Thursday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains that will wind down
on Thursday; Chance of freezing rain over parts of the Upper
Midwest and Northern New England on Wednesday...

...Extreme Fire Weather risk for parts of the Central/Southern
Plains; Temperatures will be 25 to 40 degrees above average for
the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes/Ohio Valley...

A developing area of low pressure over the Central Plains will
move northeastward to the Upper Great Lakes by late Wednesday
night, then move into Central Ontario by Thursday.  The system
will produce a myriad of weather and associated hazards.  First,
the storm will create snow from the Northern Rockies to parts of
the Southwest that will move onto the Northern/Central Plains by
Wednesday evening. Next, rain in the Great Lakes will move into
the Northeast, with light snow developing over parts of Northern
New England. Then, overnight Wednesday, as the warm air moves in
over the region, cold air will get trapped in the valleys and
produce areas of freezing rain over parts of Northern New England
through Thursday evening. Additionally, isolated pockets of
freezing rain will develop over parts of the Upper Midwest along
the rain-snow line on Wednesday afternoon into the late evening.

Third, the rain over the Upper Great Lakes will begin to become
more convective in nature (thunderstorms). During the afternoon,
showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the
associated front; some of the thunderstorms will become severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued Moderate Risk of Severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley
through Thursday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater
probability of 65 knots or greater wind gusts over the region.
The thunderstorms will wind down over the Upper Midwest and change
over to snow by Thursday.

The fourth hazard will be high wind associated with the strong
pressure gradient associated with the deep area of low pressure.
Therefore, high Wind Warnings are posted from the Central/Southern
High Plains to the Great Lakes, with Storm Warnings over Lake
Michigan.

Furthermore, ahead of the front, temperatures will be 25 to 40
degrees above average for the Plains, Mississippi Valley, and
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. In addition, many record-high
temperatures are forecast over parts of the Southern Plains into
the Upper Midwest. Along with the heat, the SPC has issued an
Extreme Fire Weather risk for parts of the Central/Southern Plains
through Thursday morning. Very dangerous wildfire-spread
conditions will be over the region, with dry fuels and very windy
conditions with wind gusts up to 40+ mph.

Moreover, the showers and thunderstorms will continue along the
front over the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Southern Plains.
Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will pool along the front
producing heavy rain. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower Mississippi Valleys on Thursday into Friday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

In the meantime, a front will move onshore over the Northwest that
will move southward over the West Coast and dissipate by Thursday
evening, as the associated upper-level energy moves inland to the
Rockies by Friday.   The system will produce coastal rain and
higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. The rain and snow expand into Central California and
the Great Basin overnight Wednesday.  Rain will move into parts of
Southern California on Thursday.  The rain and snow start to wind
down overnight Thursday over the Pacific Northwest and California.
Concurrently, snow will move into parts of the Northern/Central
Rockies and the Northern High plains by Friday morning.

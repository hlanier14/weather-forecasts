Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CST Sat Nov 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. No changes were made. See
below for meteorological discussion.

..Marsh.. 11/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1256 AM CST Sat Nov 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low is forecast to become absorbed by a
large-scale trough as it moves from near the Texas/New Mexico and
Mexico border this morning into the southern/southeastern United
States through tonight. As this occurs, broad mid-level ridging is
forecast to build across much of the western United States.
Meanwhile, a relatively weak area of surface high pressure is
forecast to remain over the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
Poor (to very poor) overnight RH recoveries coupled with lingering
breeziness will likely promote at least pockets of elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions through this morning and
into this afternoon over the interior mountains/valleys of Southern
California. The most likely area for locally critical fire weather
conditions is from portions of the Ventura Valley into the San
Gabriel Mountains. Fire weather conditions are forecast to generally
improve by mid/late afternoon as the pressure gradient weakens
further and winds speeds relax (though single digit RH values will
remain).

Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions may redevelop
later tonight into Day 2/Sunday as modest strengthening of the
surface pressure gradient promotes breezy surface winds amidst poor
overnight RH recoveries.

...Southern Plains...
Breezy and dry post-frontal northeast surface winds are forecast
from late this morning through late this afternoon as a cold front
sags southward across the Southern Plains. At least a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions are likely as sustained surface
winds of 15-20 mph overlap minimum RH values near 20% and at least
modestly receptive fuels (ERCs generally exceeding the 80th
percentile). The Elevated area was expanded farther eastward into
the Texas Panhandle and portions of far western Oklahoma to match
the most aggressive guidance (e.g., HRRR, FV3, GFS) as they tend to
perform best in post-frontal regimes. Any fire weather concerns will
diminish rapidly by this evening as wind speeds decrease and RH
values improve.

...Southeast...
A dry and relatively cool continental air mass is forecast to remain
across much of the Southeast United States through today. While
near-critical RH values are likely from midday into the evening,
surface wind speeds should generally remain light enough to preclude
large-scale fire weather concerns. One exception could be across the
higher terrain of the Appalachians where topographic enhancement may
promote pockets of locally elevated fire weather conditions for a
few hours.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM CST Sat Nov 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

The current forecast remains on track and no changes were made.

... Southeast Wyoming / Central High Plains ...

The cooler airmass in place across southeast Wyoming (and
surrounding areas) in the wake of today's (Saturday's) cold front
will warm quickly on Sunday as westerly downslope flow develops in
response to tightening low-level height gradients. The tightening
height gradient will result in 25-35 mph winds, with much higher
gusts. Without appreciable moisture return, the warmer temperatures
on Sunday will let relative humidity fall as low as 20-percent,
which is approaching the critical relative humidity threshold of 15
percent. If relative humidity falls more than expected, elevated
highlights may be required. This will be re-evaluated with the
initial day 1 forecast issued early Sunday morning.

..Marsh.. 11/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CST Sat Nov 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level ridge over the western United States is forecast
to gradually recede southward through Day 2/Sunday as a mid-level
shortwave trough approaches the eastern Pacific coast. Meanwhile, a
relatively weak area of surface high pressure if forecast to remain
over the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are forecast
much of Day 2/Sunday as a persistent dry airmass (single digit
minimum RH values and poor overnight recoveries) overlaps lingering
breeziness (sustained winds of 15-20 mph) and critically-receptive
fuels (ERC values exceeding the 90th percentile). In general, the
lack of appreciable upper-level support will preclude a more robust
fire weather threat.

200 PM EST Sat Nov 27 2021

...Overview...

Periods of relatively low amplitude upper troughing are expected
for parts of the central and eastern U.S. as shortwaves move
quickly through the mean flow, and these impulses could lead to
light precipitation from the Midwest to Northeast, especially for
favored lake effect and terrain areas. Meanwhile in the
western/central U.S., upper ridging will be in place for much of
the period, causing milder than average temperatures with
potentially record-breaking warmth.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z model guidance begins the medium range period Tuesday
with reasonably good agreement with the overall pattern, though
slight differences remain with shortwaves tracking through
southern Canada and the Great Lakes even early in the period. But
the general consensus is for shortwave energy to quickly dig
through the central and eastern U.S. Wednesday into Thursday,
while additional energy and a surface low track Canada and into
the Great Lakes region by Thursday. Meanwhile there are minimal
differences regarding ridging in the West, and southern stream
compact lows in the eastern Pacific that show some placement and
strength differences may not have much of an effect on the CONUS.
A multi-model deterministic blend of the 00Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET
and 06Z GFS was utilized early in the period as guidance was
fairly well clustered.

Greater model differences arise later Thursday and through the end
of the week as shortwave energy stemming from the lower
predictability higher latitudes and/or over the Pacific track into
and across the U.S. and Canada. At this forecast lead time it is
difficult to tell how these relatively small and low
predictability features will evolve, and deterministic guidance
and ensemble members vary greatly with which shortwaves become the
ones to dig considerably and create meaningful changes to the
large scale flow. Run to run variability remains high particularly
with the deterministic ECMWF runs, but the GFS runs do not
necessarily agree with the ensemble means either. For the latter
part of the medium range period, trended quickly toward a GEFS and
EC ensemble mean blend, since these were better aligned with each
other and lessened individual model differences. The main change
to the previous forecast was to track fronts somewhat faster
across the central and eastern U.S. per the uncertain but overall
model consensus. This also lowered expected QPF across the
Mid-South with shorter resonance time of the front.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As rounds of shortwave energy pass over the north-central to
northeastern U.S., expect generally light precipitation across
those areas. With the west and northwesterly flow, favored lake
enhancement areas as well as upslope terrain in the interior
Northeast could see enhanced totals, and at this time it appears
downwind of Lake Ontario into the Adirondacks should see the
highest precipitation amounts. Meanwhile, periods of moist onshore
flow into the Olympic Peninsula and the northern Cascades should
lead to generally moderate rain and snow amounts, especially
Tuesday into Wednesday. Snow levels are uncertain at this point
with the ridgier GFS suite showing rain and less precipitation
reaching into Washington, while the EC and CMC are wetter and have
lower snow levels, but at least the highest terrain should have
snow. Northern parts of the Rockies will also see light to
moderate precipitation in this pattern. Other than these two
highlighted regions, a majority of the country will be generally
dry other than increasing moisture for the latter part of the week
from southern Texas northeastward into the Mid-South.

Temperatures are expected to be considerably above normal for much
of the country next week thanks to ridging overhead. Both highs
and lows are forecast to be 20-30 degrees above average for
northern and central portions of the High Plains and expanding
into the Mississippi Valley Wednesday and Thursday. A few
locations may reach or exceed daily maximum and minimum
temperature records with these mild temperatures. As the flow
flattens during the late period, above normal temperatures should
spread toward the East Coast for the latter part of the workweek
after a cooler than average start.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat November 27 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Valid 00Z Sun Nov 28 2021 - 00Z Tue Nov 30 2021

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Pacific Northwest through Sunday morning...
\...Heavy lake enhanced snow downwind from the Great Lakes and
snow for parts of New England and The Central Appalachians...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern Rockies and Northern/Central High Plains...

A plume of moisture will stream into the Pacific Northwest through
Monday morning.  The moisture will aid in producing heavy rain
over parts of the Northwest Saturday into Sunday.  Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Pacific Northwest through Sunday morning. The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.  The
rain intensity will reduce slightly on Sunday and likewise, the
threat of excessive rainfall will decrease slightly. Consequently,
the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Pacific Northwest on Sunday into Monday morning.
However, the associated heavy rain will create localized areas of
flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with
heavy rain.

Meanwhile, low pressure over the Great Lakes will aid in producing
snow over the Great Lakes into the Northeast/Central Appalachians
through Monday.  Downwind from Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron,
and Erie, the snow will be very heavy, including parts of
Michigan=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs eastern Upper Peninsula and the northern third =
of the
Lower Peninsula, northeastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, and
western New York State, likewise, through Monday. In addition,
some parts of the Ohio Valley will have rain with this system.

Also, moisture off the Western Gulf of Mexico and upper-level
energy will produce light rain over parts of the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley through late Sunday night.
Furthermore, upper-level ridging over the Northwest will allow
temperatures to be 15 to 30 degrees above average over parts of
the Northern Rockies and Northern/Central High Plains, expanding
into parts of the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley on Monday.

...Heavy lake enhanced snow downwind from the Great Lakes and snow
for parts of New England and The Central Appalachians...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern Rockies and Northern/Central High Plains...

A plume of moisture will continue to stream into the Pacific
Northwest through Monday morning. This moisture will produce
moderate to isolated heavy rainfall over parts of the Northwest
today. With most of the heaviest rainfall having fallen on
Saturday, the risk for flash flooding has been downgraded to a
marginal for today. That being said, parts of the Olympics and
northern Cascades can expect to receive several more inches of
rainfall through tonight. The associated rain will create
localized areas of flash flooding, affecting places that
experience rapid runoff with heavy rain. On-and-off periods of
rain showers are to continue across the region through Tuesday.

Meanwhile, an Alberta clipper will cross the Midwest and into the
interior Northeast today producing snow across much of the Great
Lakes region and into the Northeast/Central Appalachians through
Monday.  Downwind from Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie,
the snow will be heavy, including parts of Michigan=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs east=
ern
Upper Peninsula and the northern third of the Lower Peninsula,
northeastern Ohio, northwestern Pennsylvania, and western New York
State, likewise, through Monday. Snowfall totals are likely to
range between 4-8 inches with locally higher totals expected
downwind of the lakes, particularly Lake Eerie where they may
receive upwards of a foot or more of snow through Monday
afternoon. Winds are expected to pickup across New England as this
clipper system deepens over the Northeast/Canadian maritime on
Monday.

Also, moisture off the Western Gulf of Mexico and upper-level
energy will produce light rain and scattered thunderstorms over
parts of the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley through
tonight. Furthermore, upper-level ridging over the Northwest will
allow temperatures to be 15 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern Rockies and Northern/Central Plains, expanding
into parts of the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley through
Tuesday while below average temperatures will be shift into the
East Coast on Monday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 AM EST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 1 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 5 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow from the Plains to the East Coast with multiple shortwave
perturbations pivoting around a synoptic scale trough over
southeast Canada.  This will include an organized low pressure
system tracking across southern Canada through Friday with a
trailing front followed by a weaker low this weekend.  By next
Sunday, another storm system may develop across the Plains along a
strong frontal boundary.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite begins the period on Wednesday with
average levels of agreement and then below average forecast
confidence for late week and beyond.  Recent GFS runs have been
quite varied regarding a southern stream shortwave crossing the
Gulf Coast region late in the week, with limited support from the
ensemble means.  There has also been a fair amount of model
run-to-run variability with the ECMWF as well across the Great
Lakes region and the degree of northern stream trough amplitude.
Towards the end of the forecast period, the CMC is much stronger
with an East Coast trough, although not as impressive as its 12Z
run.  There is also a high degree of model spread along the West
Coast by next weekend owing to a disorganized flow pattern over
the northeast Pacific and potential weakening of the upper ridge
axis.

The WPC forecast was primarily derived from the 12Z
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET for Wednesday and Thursday, and then more of the
GEFS/EC means thereafter while maintaining 20-30 percent of the
previous WPC forecast for pressures in order to maintain good
continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Things should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected.  The active pattern favoring atmospheric
rivers over Washington state in the short-range period is expected
to abate by Thursday as a surface high builds over the Pacific
Northwest and British Columbia.  Light to moderate rain is likely
from the Great Lakes to the Northeast through mid-week owing to
the progressive storm system near the U.S./Canada border, followed
by some lake effect rain/snow showers to close out the week.
Depending on the eventual strength and location of a potential
organized low pressure system over the Plains next week, showers
and some thunderstorms will be possible from the Gulf Coast to the
Midwest.

Temperatures are expected to be well above normal for this time of
year across the Western U.S. and the Plains through the end of the
week owing to the ridge aloft, and closer to normal for the East
Coast on Wednesday followed by a warming trend for Thursday and
Friday.  Both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees
above average for northern and central portions of the High Plains
and expanding into the Midwest for Wednesday and Thursday.  A few
locations may approach daily maximum and minimum temperature
records with these mild temperatures.  However, it is worth noting
that substantial changes to the forecast are possible going
forward given the uncertainties noted in recent model runs.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0133 AM CST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level ridge over the western United States is forecast
to gradually flatten through today as a mid-level shortwave
perturbation approaches the Pacific Northwest coast. Meanwhile, an
area of persistent surface high pressure will remain entrenched
across the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
A very dry air mass is forecast to remain over inland areas of
Southern California through today with poor overnight recoveries
(this morning and again tonight) and daytime minimum RH values under
5%. Periods of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
will be possible, especially in terrain-favored areas, as sustained
surface winds of 15-20 mph overlap critically-receptive fuels.

Locally critical fire weather conditions are most likely across
portions of the Ventura Valley into the San Gabriel Mountains and
across the Peninsular Range, where topographic enhancements to the
low-level flow is greatest.

...Eastern Wyoming/Montana and vicinity...
Strong westerly downslope flow is forecast to develop from midday
today through late this afternoon with sustained surface winds near
25-35 mph (much stronger gusts). While the presence of at least
modestly receptive fuels may promote a few hours of locally elevated
fire weather conditions, large-scale fire weather concerns are not
currently anticipated with forecast minimum RH values generally
exceeding of 30%.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0134 AM CST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
A western United States mid-level ridge is forecast to become
suppressed farther southwestward Day 2/Monday as a fast-moving
mid-level shortwave perturbation moves onshore across the Pacific
Northwest and into the central Plains through the end of the period.
Meanwhile, an area of persistent surface high pressure over the
Great Basin is forecast to weaken during the afternoon before
becoming reestablished later Day 2/Monday.

...Southern California...
While some modest moistening of the low-level air mass across inland
portions of Southern California will occur Day 2/Monday, minimum RH
values should still fall to near 10-15%. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions are possible from morning through
at least midday, especially across terrain favored areas, before
surface winds weaken as the pressure gradient relaxes. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may return late Day 2/Monday into
Day 3/Tuesday due to poor overnight RH recoveries and lingering
breeziness. Overall, this fire weather forecast remains on the more
aggressive side of the forecast envelope since most guidance has
tended to underforecast the strength of the pressure gradient
throughout this offshore wind event.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1109 AM CDT Fri Apr 15 2022

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Critical highlights have been extended further east into the Texas
Panhandle, as current surface observations already show sustained
westerly winds over 20 mph coinciding with RH well under 15 percent.
High-resolution ensemble guidance suggests that these conditions
will continue through the afternoon. Elevated highlights have also
been expanded westward towards the Arizona/New Mexico border, as
guidance shows a more favorable surface wind/RH overlap prevailing
through the afternoon. Otherwise, the previous forecast (see below)
for both the southern High Plains and East U.S. remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 04/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel speed maximum embedded within broad westerly flow will
cross the central and southern Rockies today. In response, a lee
surface low will develop near southeastern CO and the TX/OK
Panhandles. The combination of very dry boundary-layer conditions
and breezy surface winds will result in enhanced fire-weather
conditions across parts of the central and southern High Plains
today.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
00Z soundings across the central and southern High Plains show a
very dry airmass already in place (10-15 percent RH), with poor
overnight recoveries expected. Downslope warming/drying accompanying
the midlevel speed maximum combined with diurnal heating/mixing will
result in widespread 10-20 percent RH across the central and
southern High Plains. At the same time, a tightening pressure
gradient peripheral to the developing lee surface low will favor
15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds. The strongest winds are
expected in the immediate lee of the central and southern Rockies,
where Critical highlights have been added. Fuels across the region
remain very dry (ERCs in the 90th-95th percentile), which will
further exacerbate the wildfire-spread threat.

...Central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley...
A dry airmass will be in place across the central Appalachians into
the Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley today, where 15-25 percent RH will
be possible during the afternoon. However, current indications are
that the overlap of breezy surface winds and low RH will be too
spatially limited for highlights at this time.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 15 2022

SYNOPSIS: Surface low pressure is expected to intensify during the first fe=
w
days in week-2 across the central contiguous U.S. This pattern increases th=
e
chances for high winds across parts of the Southwest, Eastern Rockies, and
much
of the Great Plains. Thunderstorms with locally heavy rainfall are also lik=
ely
across the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley, leading to possible floodin=
g
in
parts of the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley. Predominantly northerly f=
low
during the first couple of days in week-2 is expected to bring cold
temperatures to parts of northern California and the Pacific Northwest.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of high winds for parts of the Eastern Rockies and Great Plai=
ns,
Sat, Apr 23.

Slight risk of high winds across the southwestern CONUS, Eastern Rockies, a=
nd
Great Plains, Sat-Sun, Apr 23-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley, Sat-Mon, Apr 23-25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of California, Oreg=
on,
and Nevada, Sat-Sun, Apr 23-24.

Flooding possible along parts of the Illinois River and the Red River of th=
e
North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY APRIL 18 - FRIDAY APRIL 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vU_nxAhA9V-rpMYmDBNanaJmp13xbbd3F8NMuGY8QsIDPo5h7PlcO9xCKv7xt=
oH5e43iIq7o$

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 23 - FRIDAY APRIL 29: Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs =
ensemble model guidance is
in
decent agreement in predicting an amplified pattern across the CONUS during
the
first half of week-2, with troughing over the western and central CONUS and
ridging over the East. The pattern is expected to become more zonal and
progressive during the latter half of the period. Despite good agreement in
the
eastward progression of the long-wave pattern early in the period, there is
some disagreement in the amplitude. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF=
 ensemble solution favors a
less amplified pattern through the middle of week-2, while the GEFS and
Canadian ensembles indicate a highly amplified pattern in the first half of
the
period.



As the 500-hPa trough exits the Rockies early in week-2, surface cyclogenes=
is
with a dryline is likely to develop across the Central High Plains. This
predicted 500-hPa and surface pattern are very favorable for high winds acr=
oss
parts of the southwestern and central CONUS. Given the good day-to-day mode=
l
continuity, pattern recognition, and time of year, a moderate risk of high
winds is posted for parts of the Eastern Rockies, extending into the Centra=
l
to
Southern Great Plains on Apr 23. An encompassing slight risk of high winds =
is
also posted for parts of the Southwest, Eastern Rockies, and across much of
the
Great Plains from Texas to the Canadian border. The European reforecast too=
l
indicates at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentil=
e
of
the historical distribution early in the period (Apr 23 to 24) for all area=
s
where a slight risk of high winds is posted. Any enhancement of surface win=
ds
across the Southwest and Great Plains is likely to result in elevated to hi=
gh
wildfire danger due to the ongoing drought conditions. Also, blowing dust i=
s
expected to accompany the gusty winds from New Mexico east to the Central a=
nd
Southern High Plains. Exacerbation of ongoing drought is also a concern, as
high winds will tend to increase evaporation of moisture from soils.



Ahead of the mid-level trough over the central CONUS, the potential for
thunderstorms with locally heavy rain is expected through the first few day=
s
in
week-2. Based on the likelihood of returning low-level moisture from the Gu=
lf
of Mexico, good model agreement on the 500-hPa trough axis shifting eastwar=
d
across the central CONUS, and 24-hour precipitation amounts from the ensemb=
le
means, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for much of the Great
Plains, extending eastward to the Mississippi Valley Apr 23 to 25. The GEFS
precipitation signals are slightly muted, compared to those in the ECMWF an=
d
Canadian ensemble solutions. However, given the good agreement in the timin=
g
of
this system and the increased amplification of the mid-level trough in the
GEFS, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS solution, the =
slight risk for heavy
precipitation was continued from yesterday.



Northerly surface flow and cold temperatures are likely across parts of
southern Cascades, northern Sierra Nevadas, and western Great Basin, follow=
ing
the passage of a mid-level trough leading up to week-2. Based on the ECMWF
reforecast tool, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted =
Apr
23-24 for parts of California, Oregon, and Nevada, where there is at least =
a
20
percent chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of
the
climatological distribution and below 40 deg F.



Moderate flooding continues along parts of the Illinois River and the Red
River
of the North. Based on recent heavy precipitation (Midwest) and snowfall
(Northern Plains), and forecasts from the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction
Service, a flooding possible hazard is maintained for the Illinois River an=
d
the Red River of the North throughout week-2.



Early in week-2, the GEFS and Canadian ensemble models are indicating the
potential for a snowfall event across portions of the Northern Plains,
associated with intensifying surface low pressure. Several locations that m=
ay
be impacted are the same that experienced record snowfall for this time of
year
this past week. However, the likelihood of snowfall is greatly reduced in t=
he
ECMWF ensemble, relative to the GEFS and Canadian ensemble. Additionally,
there
are some run-to-run inconsistencies in the GEFS and Canadian ensemble
solutions, increasing uncertainty for locations that might be affected by
heavy
snowfall. As such, no heavy snow hazards are posted at this time, given the
increased uncertainty, but snowfall early in the period should not be ruled
out.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WESTERN INTO CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO...

The latest guidance consensus has trended drier and windier across
portions of the Desert Southwest tomorrow/Saturday. The current
thinking is that widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
will overlap 10-20 percent RH across much of Arizona, New Mexico,
and far south-central Colorado. Elevated highlights have been
introduced where the aforementioned meteorological surface
conditions are expected and fuels are at least marginally receptive
to fire spread. Critical highlights have also been added to portions
of western into central New Mexico, where the most favorable surface
wind/RH overlap is expected to occur, and where fuels have become
modestly to highly receptive to wildfire spread (per collaboration
with the ABQ WFO).

..Squitieri.. 04/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0158 AM CDT Fri Apr 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough will advance eastward across the
Southwest, while a cold front continues southward across the
southern Plains. While breezy post-frontal surface winds are
expected across the central and southern Plains, RH should generally
remain above 25 percent.

...Southwest...
Ahead of the approaching midlevel shortwave trough, 15-25 mph
southwesterly surface winds will develop amid 10-20 percent RH
during the afternoon. However, only modestly receptive fuels across
the region preclude the introduction of highlights at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion

300 PM EDT Fri Apr 15 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 18 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 22 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A relatively progressive pattern through the medium-range period
will periodically send fronts and low pressure systems eastward
across the nation with some potential for cyclogenesis to occur
over the Northeast where a broad upper trough tends to persist.
The first system is forecast to move across the Great Lakes on
Monday and will likely interact with another frontal wave moving
across the Deep South and then potentially phase over the
Northeast on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the next system is forecast to
move into the West Coast Monday-Tuesday before heading across the
rest of the country late next week with the main low pressure
center likely tracking north of the Great Lakes. A third system
from the Pacific is then forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest
on Wednesday and appear to take its time moving across the western
U.S. through late next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance suite this morning appears to show reasonably good
agreement with the aforementioned synoptic pattern evolution
through much of the medium-range period.  By late next week, model
differences are most noticeable across the Plains where the
ECMWF/EC mean develops a slightly stronger surface low over the
southern Plains while the GFS/GEFS emphasizes the northern stream
low/front.  Earlier in the week, the EC tends to favor a stronger
low to track up the New England coast while keeping the northern
stream low weaker.  The opposite is true with the GFS solutions.
Recent model runs have trended toward an intermediate solution
with this northern-southern stream interaction, while the most
recent GFS indicates a much more robust coastal cyclogenesis.  By
late next week, the ECMWF has gradually slowed down the low
pressure system moving through the Great Lakes to better agree
with the GFS and CMC solutions.

Therefore the WPC medium-range forecast package was a
multi-model/ensemble consensus consisting of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, with
more weights given to the ensemble means on Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain rather unsettled with two well-defined events.  The
first round of rain and mountain snow is expected late Monday into
Tuesday from northern California to Washington state, and the
second arriving Thursday and early Friday, extending farther south
into central California and also affecting areas to the north.
This will be highly beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken
areas of California, with the potential for up to three inches of
rain in some areas next week, and 1-2 feet of snow for the Sierra.
 Elsewhere across the continental U.S., showers and thunderstorms
will be exiting the East Coast region early in the week, followed
by dry weather as high pressure settles into the region.  Another
round of organized showers and storms is likely across the central
U.S. by midweek as Gulf moisture is advected northward ahead of
the organizing storm system over the central Plains.  Potential
northern-southern stream interaction could bring some form of wet
snow across interior New England on Tuesday.

Temperatures are expected to remain rather chilly from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and Appalachians through much
of the upcoming week, and these below average readings should also
include much of the East Coast region through about Wednesday as
the cold Canadian surface high governs the weather pattern.  On
the contrary, warm conditions are currently expected across much
of the interior western U.S. for the majority of the forecast
period, with above normal readings probable across the central and
southern Plains on Wednesday ahead of the cold front.
Temperatures should also moderate for the Eastern U.S. by Thursday
as the surface high moves off the coast and warmer southerly flow
commences.

300 PM EDT Fri April 15 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 21 - 25 2022

Similar to yesterday, the 500-hPa height field for today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day period
is
characterized by troughing over the Gulf of Alaska and adjacent Northeast
Pacific. The GEFS, ECMWF and Canadian ensembles all have the trough axis
slightly east relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solut=
ions, and similar to
yesterday
the Canadian model centers the trough further east relative to the other tw=
o
models. Also present is a broad ridge over the eastern CONUS. All three mod=
els
agree on the location of this ridge, with the GEFS favoring a slightly weak=
er
anomaly when compared with the ECMWF and Canadian solutions. Models are giv=
en
equal weighting for the 500-hPa height manual blend given a lack of a clear
outlier in the individual models.

The 6-10 day temperature outlook features a large area of above normal
temperatures for most of the CONUS, extending from the Great Basin to the E=
ast
Coast with the exception of parts of Maine, where near normal temperatures =
are
favored. Below average temperatures are favored for the West Coast and alon=
g
the U.S.-Canadian border. In Alaska below average temperatures are forecast
for
northern, central, and southeast portions of the state along with the
panhandle
region, while above-average temperatures are favored for western Alaska and
the
Aleutian Islands.

Wetter-than-normal conditions for the western and central CONUS are favored=
 in
the 6-10 precipitation outlook, with the exception of the Desert Southwest,
where precipitation is typically near zero for this time of year. The highe=
st
probability of above-average precipitation extends from central California
northeastward to the Canadian border then east to the northern Great Lakes.
Below normal precipitation is forecast across much of the eastern CONUS
underneath anomalous ridging. Increased chances for above (below) normal
precipitation are favored across southern (northern) Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 33% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: 4 out of 5, due to converging
solutions among model output and guidance tools compared to yesterday.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 23 - 29 2022

In the 8-14 day period the trough off the West Coast in the early period is
forecast to propagate eastward and weaken as it moves ashore in all model
solutions, while the ridge over the eastern CONUS begins to move east and
north
to a center over New England. As the ridge moves away from the Ohio River
valley, negative height anomalies are favored to begin to spread north and
west
from the central Atlantic. Meanwhile, as the trough over the Pacific Northw=
est
moves ashore, a new area of lower heights is predicted to form over the Gul=
f
of
Alaska, potentially setting the stage for another short wave to move into t=
he
North Pacific beyond the 8-14 forecast period. Model solutions are in good
agreement with respect to the overall pattern, more so than the 6-10 day
period, and like in the 6-10 day period all models are given equal weightin=
g
in
the manual blend.

The 8-14 day temperature outlook has a similar pattern to the 6-10 day peri=
od,
with the above-average temperature probabilities propagating eastward relat=
ive
to the early period as the 500-hPa ridge begins shifting north and east, wh=
ile
below-average temperatures are favored west of the Rocky Mountains and alon=
g
the Canadian border, with the greatest probabilities centered over the Paci=
fic
Northwest. In Alaska below-average temperatures are favored for central and
southeastern portions of the state along with the panhandle, while
above-average temperatures are forecast for southwest Alaska and the Aleuti=
an
Islands.

The eastward shift of the overall pattern is also evident in the 8-14
precipitation outlook, with above-average precipitation pulling away from t=
he
West Coast and moving into the Great Plains and along the northern tier of =
the
CONUS. Below-average precipitation probabilities persist for the eastern U.=
S.
and build into the West Coast as the main area of precipitation pulls off t=
he
Rocky Mountains and into the central U.S. In Alaska the north-south dry-wet
pattern continues with some slight changes. The wetter-than-normal
probabilities expand northward along the Alaska-Canada border while
below-normal precipitation is favored for northwestern Alaska.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 33% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: 4 out of 5, with good agreemen=
t
among models and guidance tools.

FORECASTER: Daniel Barandiaran

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Unsettled pattern continues this weekend in the South with
isolated instances of severe weather and flash flooding possible...

...Snowfall expected from the Sierra Nevada to the Northern
Rockies through Saturday and into the Northern Plains Sunday...

...Contrasting temperatures this weekend with abnormally hot
conditions in the South and chilly conditions in the North;
Critical fire weather in the Southwest Saturday...

An unsettled pattern featuring showers and thunderstorms will
continue across the South through the weekend as two frontal
systems meander over the region. Focusing initially on the
Mid-South, areas of showers and thunderstorms are likely ahead of
a wave of low pressure in the Southern Plains and along a warm
front lifting north through the Lower Mississippi Valley Friday
evening. The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has issued a Slight
Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms from eastern Oklahoma
through Arkansas and into western Tennessee where large hail,
damaging winds, and tornadoes are possible. There is also a
Marginal Risk (level 1/4) for Excessive Rainfall from the Ozarks
on east into the heart of the Mid-South where efficient downpours
may produce up to 1.5"/hour rain rates leading to localized
instances of flash flooding. Flood Watches have also been issued
for the area. By Saturday, a cold front pushes through the East
and the Deep South, with the latter having the best odds for
witnessing strong-to-severe thunderstorms. The SPC has an
expansive Marginal Risk (level 1/5) for damaging winds and hail
stretching from the Rio Grande on east to the Southeast coast.
There is a more localized Slight Risk from southeastern Arkansas
through central Mississippi and into southwestern Alabama where
more organized storms will pose a greater threat for damaging
winds. There is also a Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall in the
Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday as storms are expected to
continue to produce heavy downpours and may have a tendency to
train over the same areas in the vicinity of the front, producing
between 2-3 inches of rain. While severe storms are less likely, a
few thunderstorms could transpire along the I-95 corridor in the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic as the cold front traverses these
regions Saturday afternoon. Finally, for Sunday, a similar threat
pattern exists with a Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms over
portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and a Marginal Risk for
heavy rainfall from the Lower Mississippi Valley east through the
South. Organized thunderstorms will once again pose a threat for
damaging winds and large hail, as well as potentially heavy
downpours that may lead to additional rain totals between 2-3
inches in some locations.

Meanwhile, a Pacific storm system approaching the West Coast
Friday afternoon will usher in periods of valley/coastal rain and
mountain snow to northern California, the Sierra Nevada, and
southern Oregon Friday night. As the storm tracks inland on
Saturday, the shield of precipitation will push into the northern
Rockies where accumulating snowfall is also expected. In terms of
snowfall through early Easter Sunday morning, the heaviest totals
will be found in the Sierra Nevada and the Shastas of northern
California where up to a foot of snow is possible at higher
elevations. The Cascades will also pick up accumulations of 2 to 8
inches. In the Rockies, the Bitterroots from Montana into Idaho as
well as the Sawtooth mountains are forecast to receive 3-6 inches,
locally higher. The storm system will emerge into the Northern
Plains on Sunday, bringing snow once again to eastern Montana
through central North Dakota. While the storm is not expected to
be as intense as this past week's blizzard, snowfall totals
between 4-6 inches, locally higher, are possible on Sunday.

More broadly temperature wise, a dome of Canadian high pressure
has settled in over the Northern Plains. Morning lows are forecast
to be in the single digits Saturday morning and with highs
struggling to break the freezing mark in parts of Montana and the
Dakotas, making it feel more like mid-February rather than
mid-April. Below normal temperatures are also expected Saturday
across the Central Plains and portions of the Southern Plains
north of a cold front, with highs only in the 50s and and low 60s.
On the other hand, south of the cold front, South Texas will
become quite hot Saturday with daytime highs approaching the
century mark in the Rio Grande Valley. Easter Sunday in the South
will feel more like May with daytime highs in the 80s and 90s from
Florida and the central Gulf Coast to the Southern Plains and
Southwest. A rapid warm up is expected over the previously cooler
portions of the Southern and Central High Plains as well, with
highs from the upper 60s to the low 80s compared to Saturday. The
warm and dry temperatures in the Southwest have promoted a
Critical Risk of fire weather from the Storm Prediction Center for
Saturday.

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 18 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 22 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A relatively progressive pattern through the medium-range period
will periodically send fronts and low pressure systems eastward
across the nation with some potential for cyclogenesis to occur
over the Northeast where a broad upper trough tends to persist.
The first system is forecast to move across the Great Lakes on
Monday and will likely interact with another frontal wave moving
across the Deep South and then potentially phase over the
Northeast on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the next system is forecast to
move into the West Coast Monday-Tuesday before heading across the
rest of the country late next week with the main low pressure
center likely tracking north of the Great Lakes. A third system
from the Pacific is forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest on
Wednesday and appear to take its time moving across the western
U.S. through late next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance suite this morning appears to show reasonably good
agreement with the aforementioned synoptic pattern evolution
through much of the medium-range period.  By late next week, model
differences are most noticeable across the Plains where the
ECMWF/EC mean develops a slightly stronger surface low over the
southern Plains while the GFS/GEFS emphasizes the northern stream
low/front.  Earlier in the week, the EC tends to favor a stronger
low to track up the New England coast while keeping the northern
stream low weaker.  The opposite is true with the GFS solutions.
Recent model runs have trended toward an intermediate solution
with this northern-southern stream interaction, while the most
recent GFS indicates a much more robust coastal cyclogenesis.  On
the other hand, the ECMWF takes the low on a more inland track
while the CMC indicates an intermediate solution.  By late next
week, the ECMWF has gradually slowed down the low pressure system
moving through the Great Lakes to better agree with the GFS and
CMC solutions.

Therefore the WPC medium-range forecast package was a
multi-model/ensemble consensus consisting of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, with
more weights given to the ensemble means on Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain rather unsettled with two well-defined events.  The
first round of rain and mountain snow is expected late Monday into
Tuesday from northern California to Washington state, and the
second arriving Thursday and early Friday, extending farther south
into central California and also affecting areas to the north.
This will be highly beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken
areas of California, with the potential for up to three inches of
rain in some areas next week, and 1-2 feet of snow for the Sierra.
 Elsewhere across the continental U.S., showers and thunderstorms
will be exiting the East Coast region early in the week, followed
by dry weather as high pressure settles into the region.  Another
round of organized showers and storms is likely across the central
U.S. by midweek as Gulf moisture returns ahead of the organizing
storm system over the central Plains.  For the East Coast,
potential northern-southern stream interaction and phasing could
possibly bring some heavy wet snow across interior New England
Tuesday into early Wednesday with antecendent heavy rain possible
near the Carolina coasts on Monday, reaching the New England coast
on Tuesday.

Temperatures are expected to remain rather chilly from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and Appalachians through much
of the upcoming week, and these below average readings should also
include much of the East Coast region through about Wednesday as
the cold Canadian surface high governs the weather pattern.  On
the contrary, warm conditions are currently expected across much
of the interior western U.S. for the majority of the forecast
period, with above normal readings probable across the central and
southern Plains on Wednesday ahead of the cold front.
Temperatures should also moderate for the Eastern U.S. by Thursday
as the surface high moves off the coast and warmer southerly flow
commences.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
415 PM EDT Fri Apr 15 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Apr 18 2022 - 12Z Fri Apr 22 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A relatively progressive pattern through the medium-range period
will periodically send fronts and low pressure systems eastward
across the nation with some potential for cyclogenesis to occur
over the Northeast where a broad upper trough tends to persist.
The first system is forecast to move across the Great Lakes on
Monday and will likely interact with another frontal wave moving
across the Deep South and then potentially phase over the
Northeast on Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the next system is forecast to
move into the West Coast Monday-Tuesday before heading across the
rest of the country late next week with the main low pressure
center likely tracking north of the Great Lakes. A third system
from the Pacific is forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest on
Wednesday and appear to take its time moving across the western
U.S. through late next week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance suite this morning appears to show reasonably good
agreement with the aforementioned synoptic pattern evolution
through much of the medium-range period.  By late next week, model
differences are most noticeable across the Plains where the
ECMWF/EC mean develops a slightly stronger surface low over the
southern Plains while the GFS/GEFS emphasizes the northern stream
low/front.  Earlier in the week, the EC tends to favor a stronger
low to track up the New England coast while keeping the northern
stream low weaker.  The opposite is true with the GFS solutions.
Recent model runs have trended toward an intermediate solution
with this northern-southern stream interaction, while the most
recent GFS indicates a much more robust coastal cyclogenesis.  On
the other hand, the ECMWF takes the low on a more inland track
while the CMC indicates an intermediate solution.  By late next
week, the ECMWF has gradually slowed down the low pressure system
moving through the Great Lakes to better agree with the GFS and
CMC solutions.

Therefore the WPC medium-range forecast package was a
multi-model/ensemble consensus consisting of 40% 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, 40% 06Z GFS/GEFS, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, with
more weights given to the ensemble means on Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain rather unsettled with two well-defined events.  The
first round of rain and mountain snow is expected late Monday into
Tuesday from northern California to Washington state, and the
second arriving Thursday and early Friday, extending farther south
into central California and also affecting areas to the north.
This will be highly beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken
areas of California, with the potential for up to three inches of
rain in some areas next week, and 1-2 feet of snow for the Sierra.
 Elsewhere across the continental U.S., showers and thunderstorms
will be exiting the East Coast region early in the week, followed
by dry weather as high pressure settles into the region.  Another
round of organized showers and storms is likely across the central
U.S. by midweek as Gulf moisture returns ahead of the organizing
storm system over the central Plains.  For the East Coast,
potential northern-southern stream interaction and phasing could
possibly bring some heavy wet snow across interior New England
Tuesday into early Wednesday with antecendent heavy rain possible
near the Carolina coasts on Monday, reaching the New England coast
on Tuesday.

Temperatures are expected to remain rather chilly from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and Appalachians through much
of the upcoming week, and these below average readings should also
include much of the East Coast region through about Wednesday as
the cold Canadian surface high governs the weather pattern.  On
the contrary, warm conditions are currently expected across much
of the interior western U.S. for the majority of the forecast
period, with above normal readings probable across the central and
southern Plains on Wednesday ahead of the cold front.
Temperatures should also moderate for the Eastern U.S. by Thursday
as the surface high moves off the coast and warmer southerly flow
commences.

Valid 12Z Tue Apr 19 2022 - 12Z Sat Apr 23 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

There will be three well-defined storm systems that will affect
the continental U.S. next week.  The first will be a coastal low
near the Northeast U.S. coast on Tuesday that will intensify as it
lifts northward towards eastern Quebec, bringing rain, wind, and
mountain snow to New England.  A large surface high will then
encompass the eastern half of the nation through Wednesday ahead
of the next developing storm system over the Plains, which should
result in another cold front reaching the East Coast by Friday.
The third system develops over the West Coast and Intermountain
West region for the end of the week as an amplified upper level
trough builds in from the Pacific, along with a downstream upper
ridge axis over the Plains.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The 00Z model guidance suite is initially in very good overall
agreement through the early-middle part of next week with above
average confidence, and although mesoscale differences become more
apparent going forward, the overall synoptic scale depiction
remains good through the remainder of the week and into Saturday.
By Thursday, the GFS becomes more progressive with the
shortwave/surface low crossing the northern tier states, but is
very close to its ensemble mean.  For the end of the week, the CMC
holds the axis of the upper trough farther back to the west
compared to the ECMWF and the ensemble means, whereas the GFS is
faster to lift the trough out of the Intermountain by Saturday.
The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a multi-deterministic
blend through Wednesday, and then gradually incorporated more of
the ECENS/GEFS means for the latter half of the forecast period.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain rather unsettled with two well defined events.  The
first round of rain and mountain snow is expected late Monday into
Tuesday from northern California to Washington state, and the
second and more impactful system arriving Thursday and early
Friday, extending farther south into central California and also
affecting areas to the north.  This late season event will deliver
highly beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken areas of
California, with the potential for up to three inches of rain in
some areas next week, and 1-3 feet of snow for the Sierra.
Elsewhere across the continental U.S., the surface low near New
England is expected to result in widespread rain, wind, and
potentially moderate to heavy snow for the higher terrain of the
Adirondacks and extending to northern Maine through Tuesday
afternoon.  Another round of organized showers and storms is
likely to develop across the central U.S. and extending northward
to the Great Lakes by midweek as Gulf moisture is advected
northward ahead of the organizing storm system over the central
Plains.  Additional moderate to heavy snow is also expected for
portions of the northern Rockies for the end of the week.

Temperatures are expected to remain rather chilly from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and Appalachians through about
Wednesday, and these below average readings may persist even
longer across North Dakota and northern Minnesota going through
the end of the week.  On the contrary, warm conditions are
currently expected across much of the interior western U.S. for
the majority of the forecast period ahead of the upper trough,
with well above normal readings probable across the western High
Plains by the end of the week and into Texas.  Temperatures should
also moderate for the Eastern U.S. by Thursday as the surface high
moves off the coast and warmer southerly flow commences.  Windy
conditions are also likely from western Texas to the western
Dakotas on Tuesday with strong southerly flow expected.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0158 AM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF WEST-CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO INTO SOUTH-CENTRAL COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and accompanying strong/deep west-southwesterly
flow will advance eastward across the Southwest today, while surface
low pressure develops across the Great Basin.

...Southwest into the Central and Southern Rockies...
Ahead of the approaching midlevel trough, deep boundary-layer mixing
will result in widespread minimum RH of 10-15 percent this
afternoon. At the same time, breezy west-southwesterly surface winds
of 20-25 mph (with higher gusts) will overspread modestly receptive
fuels. The best overlap of strong surface winds and critically low
RH is expected over parts of New Mexico into south-central Colorado,
where Critical highlights are in place. Very dry and breezy
conditions are also expected over Arizona, though fuels are not as
receptive to wildfire-spread at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Sat Apr 16 2022

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
A belt of strong midlevel westerly flow will overspread the Rockies,
resulting in surface lee troughing and dry boundary-layer conditions
over the High Plains. Late in the period, a cold front will sweep
southward across the central High Plains, with breezy northerly
surface winds persisting in its wake.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Downslope warming/drying accompanying the enhanced midlevel westerly
flow will result in 20-25 percent minimum RH over the central High
Plains, where strong west-northwesterly surface winds of 20-25 mph
will be possible. The combination of dry/windy conditions and
critically dry fuels will support high-end elevated conditions. If
guidance trends any lower with RH across this region, Critical
highlights could be needed. Farther south, a drier airmass
characterized by 10-15 percent minimum RH will develop. However,
current indications are that breezy surface winds of 15-20 mph will
generally be brief in duration.

...Abnormally mild and stormy across the South this Easter
weekend...

...Measurable snowfall from the Sierra Nevada to the Northern
Rockies today and into the northern Plains by Easter Sunday...

...Critical Fire Weather Conditions are in place over parts of
northern New Mexico...

A distinct temperature contrast between the northern and southern
tiers of the Lower 48 will be present as the South remains
abnormally warm while the North contends with more late
winter-like conditions. Starting in the South, abnormally hotter
than normal conditions will be common throughout the holiday
weekend. A small handful of record highs are forecast in South
Texas and central Florida with highs soaring above the century
mark along and near the Rio Grande Valley. Meanwhile, a cold front
pushing south through the Tennessee Valley this morning will be
responsible for igniting additional showers and thunderstorms
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Deep South today and
Easter Sunday. A pair of Slight Risks have been posted by the
Storm Prediction Center for parts of these regions each day with
damaging wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes all possible within
severe storms. In addition to the severe threat, there is also the
potential for Excessive Rainfall. A pair of Marginal Risks have
been issued in the Deep South with a small Slight Risk areas in
eastern Alabama and central Georgia on Easter Sunday. Rainfall
totals could surpass 2 inches with localized totals of 3 to 4
inches possible through the remainder of the weekend.

Farther north, temperatures that are more reminiscent of "late in
the winter" storms will be common from the Northwest to the Great
Lakes. A handful of daily record cold max and minimum temperatures
are possible in the Pacific Northwest and northern High Plains
today where daily temperature anomalies are likely to be 15-20
degrees below normal. There are also Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories that are in place early this morning. After one more
mild day in the Northeast, a cold front will usher in the cold
Canadian air-mass residing in the Midwest today. Scattered showers
and a few thunderstorms are expected along the front in the
Northeast but the odds of storms becoming severe are lower than
their neighbors to the South. Farther west, a Pacific storm system
delivering a surge of Pacific moisture will result in accumulating
snowfall from the Sierra Nevada to the northern and central
Rockies today. Snow totals up to a foot are possible in the Sierra
Nevada, the higher elevations of Idaho, and western Montana. To
account for these lighter but still potentially disruptive snow
event, Winter Weather Advisories have been issued through this
afternoon for some of the the northern Rockies and Sierras. By
Easter Sunday, the wave of low pressure exits the Rockies and
enters the Great Plains, bringing its shield of snow to the
Dakotas and Upper Midwest. Another 4 to 8 inches of snow is
forecast across northeast Montana and northern North Dakota on
Sunday.

Elsewhere, fire weather remains a big concern in parts of the
southern High Plains and lower Four Corners region. A Critical
Risk of fire weather is in place over northern New Mexico and far
southern Colorado due to gusty winds and very dry relative
humidity levels. Currently there are a pair of Elevated Risk areas
in parts of the southern and central High Plains for Easter Sunday
but a Critical Risk area may be necessary in future forecasts.

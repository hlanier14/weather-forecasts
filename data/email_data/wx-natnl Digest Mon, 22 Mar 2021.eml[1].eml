Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Sun Mar 21 2021

Valid 211700Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST INTO CENTRAL
NEW MEXICO...

An Elevated area has been introduced to portions of the northern
Plains today. The latest guidance consensus has trended drier, with
widespread 20-25% RH likely to accompany the post-cold frontal
environment by afternoon peak heating. Widespread 15-25 mph
sustained northwesterly surface winds are already in progress across
eastern Montana into the western Dakotas, as shown by the latest
METAR observations. These Elevated criteria winds are expected to
continue throughout the afternoon behind the cold front, coinciding
with the aforementioned RH, and overspreading dry fuels devoid of
meaningful precipitation over the past month.

Otherwise, the forecast remains on track across portions of the
Southwest into the southern High Plains. The best chance for
overlapping Critical winds/RH continues to be over lower-terrain
areas of extreme southeast Arizona into central New Mexico per
latest guidance. Locally Critical conditions also remain possible
across the remainder of the Elevated area.

..Squitieri.. 03/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0232 AM CDT Sun Mar 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positive-tilt trough will sharpen across the Desert Southwest
today while migrating southeastward toward the southern Rockies.
This wave will amplify flow aloft downstream into the 40-70 kt
range.  Meanwhile at the surface, a low will organize very near the
New Mexico/Texas border region.  The synoptic setup will foster
areas of elevated to critical fire-weather conditions across the
southern Rockies and High Plains.

...Eastern Arizona through western New Mexico...
Models continue to agree that a broad swath of westerly low-level
flow will develop during peak heating hours across the region.
Speeds of 15-25 mph will become common - locally higher across
southern and western New Mexico.  Meanwhile, a pre-existing dry
airmass will help RH values to lower into the 12-25% range in most
areas - locally lower from southwestern into central New Mexico.  A
critical delineation has been introduced where confidence is highest
that several hours of critically low RH values will coexist with 20+
mph surface winds.  Surrounding this delineation, critical fire
weather may be observed for brief periods throughout the afternoon.

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Mar 28 2021

...Wednesday-Thursday heavy rain threat most likely centered over
parts of the South...

...Overview...

Through late in the week two vigorous shortwaves within a large
scale mean trough with an axis over the Plains/west-central U.S.
will support fairly strong surface systems and a very warm/wet
pattern over much of the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile
incoming energy will produce areas of rain and mountain snow
extending from the Pacific Northwest into much of the Rockies
along with below normal temperatures. By next weekend guidance is
suggesting that upper ridging over the eastern Pacific will start
to build into the West and bring a warmer/drier trend for the
region, but consensus is lacking for the shape/strength of the
ridge as well as for evolution of the downstream trough. The
central-eastern U.S. should see additional precipitation and
moderately warm temperatures ahead of a third system next weekend
but a slightly flatter trend to the pattern will likely lead to
lower coverage of significant rainfall and moderate the warm
anomalies.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

With guidance finally coming together for the system tracking out
of the Upper Midwest from early Wednesday onward, the primary
forecast issues that remain are for the timing and evolution of
strong energy expected to eject northeastward from Arizona/New
Mexico along with associated low pressure, followed by the
combined details of upstream shortwave energy reaching the
western/central U.S. and Pacific ridging that should build into
the West.

Guidance is continuing to have difficulty in resolving how quickly
the upper low just south of the Four Corners on early Wednesday
ejects northeastward, and how strong/closed the feature will be as
it continues through/beyond the Plains. Over the past 24 hours
most guidance has generally held onto the slower timing introduced
by yesterday's 12Z cycle (after consensus had trended somewhat
faster for the prior two or three runs). Within the latest
envelope the 00Z ECMWF is slowest and most closed with latest CMC
runs just a little faster and also closed aloft/deep at the
surface. GFS runs already become faster and/or more open with the
upper feature versus most guidance by Thursday. Recent parallel
GFS (GFSP) runs have generally been a tad slower than operational
runs. Recent persistence of the slower progression closer to valid
time provides support to lean somewhat in the slower half of the
spread and a tad slower than continuity. However the slow 00Z
ECMWF may not be ideal either as the system is carried along by
southwesterly mean flow aloft. The old 12Z ECMWF would be closer
to representing current preference.

Upstream the general theme of recent trends has been toward some
combination of a stronger ridge moving into the West along with a
somewhat weaker/less amplified version of the western-central U.S.
trough. Individual models/ensembles also display varied ways in
which energy on the western fringe of the late week western trough
may pull off an upper low near or offshore the West Coast.
Parallel GFS runs are more reflective of recent consensus though
could be a bit deep relative to ongoing trends.

Based on forecast preferences, the operational model blend early
in the period used the 06Z GFSP for the GFS input. Then ECMWF
input split the past two runs and trended toward half 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF mean weight to yield conservative adjustments to account for
recent trends over the lower 48 from late week through the weekend.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lingering precipitation (rain and/or snow) is likely on the north
side of the surface low exiting the Upper Midwest on Wednesday.
South of this however, the interaction of moist Gulf inflow with
the trailing front--which should stall for a time while awaiting
ejection of upstream dynamics from the West and southern
Plains/Gulf Coast wave development--is likely to produce heavy
rainfall over parts of the South through Wednesday-Thursday.
Recent slower trends by the average of guidance have adjusted the
northern part of the heaviest rainfall axis a bit westward, now
from the central Gulf Coast northward into the Tennessee Valley.
Other surrounding areas could see significant rainfall as well and
the surface/upper system could be strong enough to produce another
band of enhanced precipitation on the northwest side of the
surface low track. System strength will also determine how much if
any snow may occur in the northwest fringe of the moisture shield.
Greater progression of rainfall should lead to lower totals over
areas closer to the East Coast. Some warm sector convection may be
strong/severe and future Storm Prediction Center outlooks will
provide more information on this threat as guidance becomes more
agreeable for important details.

Before helping to generate heavy rainfall downstream, the upper
system initially south of the Four Corners will produce a period
of enhanced snowfall over the southern Rockies around Wednesday.
The next upper trough moving into the West will bring a mid-late
week episode of mostly light-moderate rain/mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest and areas to the east and southeast through the
Rockies. Some precipitation (rain and/or snow) should then spread
across the northern tier as low pressure continues toward the
Great Lakes. Rainfall will likely expand over the East again ahead
of this low pressure and trailing front. A warm front may enhance
amounts over some southern areas while lighter activity should
prevail farther north.

Above normal temperatures over the eastern half of the country
will be the most extreme mid-late week, in the warm sector ahead
of the leading system tracking out of the Upper Midwest on
Wednesday and trailing system that may reach into the Great
Lakes/Northeast late in the week. Plus 10-25F anomalies for
highs/morning lows will be most common from the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. Moist flow from the Gulf
will also promote a broad area of very warm lows farther
southward. Some locations in the East may see lows close to daily
record warm values. Most of the East will see a cooler trend next
weekend but should stay moderately above normal. The upper ridge
strengthening over Cuba mid-late week and persisting into the
weekend will promote very warm temperatures over the Florida
Peninsula from Thursday onward, possibly bringing high
temperatures close to daily records at sites with a relatively
shorter period of record.

Areas from the western U.S. into Rockies/High Plains will see
below normal temperatures mid-late week followed by a warming
trend. The most extreme anomalies of 10-20F below normal for highs
are likely over the central-southern Rockies and High Plains on
Wednesday. Pockets of highs 10F or so below normal are possible
over parts of the Great Basin/central Rockies into Friday. The
arrival of the Pacific ridge aloft should bring highs up to 5-15F
above normal from the West Coast states into northern Rockies by
Sunday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 PM EDT Sun Mar 21 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 24 2021 - 12Z Sun Mar 28 2021

...Wednesday-Thursday heavy rain threat most likely centered over
parts of the South...

...Overview...

Through late in the week two vigorous shortwaves within a large
scale mean trough with an axis over the Plains/west-central U.S.
will support fairly strong surface systems and a very warm/wet
pattern over much of the eastern half of the country. Meanwhile
incoming energy will produce areas of rain and mountain snow
extending from the Pacific Northwest into much of the Rockies
along with below normal temperatures. By next weekend guidance is
suggesting that upper ridging over the eastern Pacific will start
to build into the West and bring a warmer/drier trend for the
region, but consensus is lacking for the shape/strength of the
ridge as well as for evolution of the downstream trough. The
central-eastern U.S. should see additional precipitation and
moderately warm temperatures ahead of a third system next weekend
but a slightly flatter trend to the pattern will likely lead to
lower coverage of significant rainfall and moderate the warm
anomalies.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

With guidance finally coming together for the system tracking out
of the Upper Midwest from early Wednesday onward, the primary
forecast issues that remain are for the timing and evolution of
strong energy expected to eject northeastward from Arizona/New
Mexico along with associated low pressure, followed by the
combined details of upstream shortwave energy reaching the
western/central U.S. and Pacific ridging that should build into
the West.

Guidance is continuing to have difficulty in resolving how quickly
the upper low just south of the Four Corners on early Wednesday
ejects northeastward, and how strong/closed the feature will be as
it continues through/beyond the Plains. Over the past 24 hours
most guidance has generally held onto the slower timing introduced
by yesterday's 12Z cycle (after consensus had trended somewhat
faster for the prior two or three runs). Within the latest
envelope the 00Z ECMWF is slowest and most closed with latest CMC
runs just a little faster and also closed aloft/deep at the
surface. GFS runs already become faster and/or more open with the
upper feature versus most guidance by Thursday. Recent parallel
GFS (GFSP) runs have generally been a tad slower than operational
runs. Recent persistence of the slower progression closer to valid
time provides support to lean somewhat in the slower half of the
spread and a tad slower than continuity. However the slow 00Z
ECMWF may not be ideal either as the system is carried along by
southwesterly mean flow aloft. The old 12Z ECMWF would be closer
to representing current preference.

Upstream the general theme of recent trends has been toward some
combination of a stronger ridge moving into the West along with a
somewhat weaker/less amplified version of the western-central U.S.
trough. Individual models/ensembles also display varied ways in
which energy on the western fringe of the late week western trough
may pull off an upper low near or offshore the West Coast.
Parallel GFS runs are more reflective of recent consensus though
could be a bit deep relative to ongoing trends.

Based on forecast preferences, the operational model blend early
in the period used the 06Z GFSP for the GFS input. Then ECMWF
input split the past two runs and trended toward half 06Z GEFS/00Z
ECMWF mean weight to yield conservative adjustments to account for
recent trends over the lower 48 from late week through the weekend.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lingering precipitation (rain and/or snow) is likely on the north
side of the surface low exiting the Upper Midwest on Wednesday.
South of this however, the interaction of moist Gulf inflow with
the trailing front--which should stall for a time while awaiting
ejection of upstream dynamics from the West and southern
Plains/Gulf Coast wave development--is likely to produce heavy
rainfall over parts of the South through Wednesday-Thursday.
Recent slower trends by the average of guidance have adjusted the
northern part of the heaviest rainfall axis a bit westward, now
from the central Gulf Coast northward into the Tennessee Valley.
Other surrounding areas could see significant rainfall as well and
the surface/upper system could be strong enough to produce another
band of enhanced precipitation on the northwest side of the
surface low track. System strength will also determine how much if
any snow may occur in the northwest fringe of the moisture shield.
Greater progression of rainfall should lead to lower totals over
areas closer to the East Coast. Some warm sector convection may be
strong/severe and future Storm Prediction Center outlooks will
provide more information on this threat as guidance becomes more
agreeable for important details.

Before helping to generate heavy rainfall downstream, the upper
system initially south of the Four Corners will produce a period
of enhanced snowfall over the southern Rockies around Wednesday.
The next upper trough moving into the West will bring a mid-late
week episode of mostly light-moderate rain/mountain snow to the
Pacific Northwest and areas to the east and southeast through the
Rockies. Some precipitation (rain and/or snow) should then spread
across the northern tier as low pressure continues toward the
Great Lakes. Rainfall will likely expand over the East again ahead
of this low pressure and trailing front. A warm front may enhance
amounts over some southern areas while lighter activity should
prevail farther north.

Above normal temperatures over the eastern half of the country
will be the most extreme mid-late week, in the warm sector ahead
of the leading system tracking out of the Upper Midwest on

strengthening over Cuba mid-late week and persisting into the
weekend will promote very warm temperatures over the Florida
Peninsula from Thursday onward, possibly bringing high
temperatures close to daily records at sites with a relatively
shorter period of record.

Areas from the western U.S. into Rockies/High Plains will see
below normal temperatures mid-late week followed by a warming
trend. The most extreme anomalies of 10-20F below normal for highs
are likely over the central-southern Rockies and High Plains on
Wednesday. Pockets of highs 10F or so below normal are possible
over parts of the Great Basin/central Rockies into Friday. The
arrival of the Pacific ridge aloft should bring highs up to 5-15F
above normal from the West Coast states into northern Rockies by
Sunday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun March 21 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...A storm system will become better organized across the central
U.S., bringing rain and storms to the Plains and Mississippi
Valley and snow to the Central Rockies/Front Range...

...Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for parts of the
southern High Plains through Monday...

A low pressure system is forecast to continue organizing in the
southern High Plains tonight and move slowly eastward Monday
before tracking northeast into the Lower Missouri Valley on
Tuesday. This system will spread precipitation to much of the
central U.S. over the next couple of days. On the low's backside
in and around Colorado, snow of over a foot is possible in the
Central Rockies/Front Range, and some snow should spread into the
central High Plains as well, accumulating to a few inches. Farther
east, rain and some thunderstorms are expected to increase in
coverage across much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley on
Monday into Tuesday. Through Tuesday evening, rain of 1 to 3
inches is forecast for portions of those regions, and locally
heavy rainfall could cause isolated flooding.

Limited moisture in the Southwest to southern High Plains along
with gusty winds and dry fuels will lead to fire danger over the
next couple of days. Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather
are outlined by the Storm Prediction Center there through Monday,
along with Red Flag Warnings and High Wind and Fire Weather
Watches. Another frontal system is expected to move southward from
the Northwest tonight to the Southwest by Tuesday, spreading
precipitation along with it. Snow accumulations of 6 to 12 inches
are likely in the Cascades and Northern Rockies, with a few inches
of snow in other mountainous regions across the Intermountain West
and light snow or mix in lower elevations.

In the East, showers could continue from Florida to the coastal
Carolinas overnight with an offshore low pressure system and
frontal boundary in place. Gusty winds are also possible, along
with high surf and the risk of rip currents. Dry conditions are
expected to prevail in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast underneath
high pressure.

In terms of temperatures, the western half of the U.S. will
generally be cooler than average through Tuesday given a couple of
cold frontal passages. Much of the eastern U.S. should see above
normal temperatures, with highs 10 to 20 degrees above average
from the Midwest to Northeast.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO
INTO THE TRANS PECOS REGION OF SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

Some slight modifications were made to the Elevated and Critical
delineations across portions of the Southwest into western Texas
based on model guidance consensus. The latest guidance also suggests
that at least locally Extremely Critical conditions are possible,
mainly in the Trans Pecos region of Texas by afternoon peak heating.
30+ mph sustained westerly winds (with some higher gusts)
overlapping 5-15% RH are expected, but mainly in brief fashion.
Nonetheless, while the brevity of the aforementioned surface wind/RH
overlap may preclude an Extremely Critical delineation at this time,
robust wildfire-spread potential is still expected behind the
dryline tomorrow afternoon.

Dry and breezy southerly flow close to Elevated criteria are also
expected across portions of the northern High Plains tomorrow.
However, the lack of widespread surface RH under 25% suggests that
an Elevated delineation is not needed at this time.

..Squitieri.. 03/21/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0232 AM CDT Sun Mar 21 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow will amplify further across the southern Rockies/High
Plains as a mid-level low initially over the Four Corners reaches
the High Plains through the end of the forecast period.  As this
occurs, surface troughing/cyclogenesis will become more pronounced
across the Texas South Plains and vicinity, with very dry and windy
conditions west of the trough and increasingly moist air east of the
trough.  Fire-weather concerns will increase considerably west of
the trough.

...Southern Rockies/Plains...
The combination of increasing flow aloft and a steepening surface
pressure gradient will increase surface winds into the 30-40 mph
range across a broad corridor extending from southwestern New Mexico
to the Texas South Plains.  This flow will occur within an extremely
dry airmass characterized by 60s F surface temperatures and RH
values below 10% - lowest in southeastern New Mexico and adjacent
areas of west Texas.  These conditions flirt with extremely critical
thresholds in a few areas, with the only lingering concern being
fuel states and modest ERCs.  Nevertheless, large and rapidly
spreading fires are possible where ignitions occur.

...Thursday heavy rain threat most likely centered over parts of
the South...

...Overview...

A couple of vigorous shortwaves embedded within a large scale mean
trough over the Central U.S. will support fairly strong surface
systems and warm/wet weather for much of the eastern half of the
country. This trough should finally begin to shift eastward by the
weekend as upper ridging builds across parts of the West bringing
a warmer and drier trend to the region. More shortwave energy
should also slide into the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies
early next week.


...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The first shortwave lifts from the Southern Plains into the
Midwest and eventually the Northeast Thursday-Saturday. Latest
runs of the GFS and the UKMET are faster than the ECMWF/CMC, which
also have a little better support from the ensemble means. The
next shortwave drops through the Western U.S. and amplifies over
the Central U.S. late this week, pushing into the Midwest and East
by early next week. For the most part, the guidance is in good
agreement with this system, except the GFS does get a little fast
with the energy as it lifts through the Great Lakes next
Sunday-Monday, likely due to a little bit flatter ridge upstream
across the West. However, given the late period timing, run to run
continuity for most of the guidance is still poor, so a blend
towards the ensemble means served as a good starting point.
Another batch of shortwave energy looks to cross into the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday, however models continue to show some
significant differences both in regards to timing and intensity
from one model cycle to another. The ensemble means should again
be a good solution at this time.

The WPC progs were comprised of a majority blend of the
deterministic models days 3-5, with a bit more weighting towards
the ECMWF/CMC. By day 6 and 7, uncertainty quickly increases so
more of the ensemble means were blended in to help mitigate some
of these typical late period differences.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Moist Gulf of Mexico inflow ahead of mean central U.S. troughing
will continue the threat for widespread organized rainfall along a
slow moving frontal boundary across parts of the South and Eastern
states Thursday into Friday. Models continue to point to the
heaviest rainfall axis stretching from the Central Gulf Coast into
the Southern Appalachians and Tennessee Valley. Some warm sector
convection may be strong/severe and future Storm Prediction Center
outlooks will provide more information on this threat as guidance
becomes more agreeable for important details. The deepening
surface low associated with this system may also bring a period of
light snow to the north from parts of the Great Lakes into
northern/interior New England Friday and Saturday.

The next system dropping through the West will likely bring
another round of mountain snows to the Rockies on Thursday, with a
drier trend through much of the rest of the period as upper level
ridging builds aloft. As this shortwave amplifies and slides
eastward next weekend, the models are hinting at another round of
moderate to heavy rainfall for parts of the Southeast which should
focus along a warm front across the Deep South.

The eastern third of the country will stay warm and above normal
through much of the period, with the greatest anomalies (+15-20F)
across the Northeast Thursday and Friday. Morning lows will be
even more so anomalously warm, with several record high minimum
temperatures possible late this week stretching from Florida to
the Northeast. Out West, temperatures should trend warmer after
this week as upper level ridging builds across the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO AND PORTIONS
OF WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
On D2/Tue, A longer-wave trough will settle into the Desert
Southwest quickly in the wake of an ejecting trough across the
Plains/mid-Mississippi Valley area.  This will foster continued
enhancement of flow aloft across dry areas of the southern Rockies
and adjacent High Plains.  Fire-weather concerns will be focused
along these areas throughout the forecast period.

...Southeastern Arizona through west Texas...
A generally similar surface flow regime will reside across the
region during the afternoon, with a corridor of westerly surface
flow exceeding 20 mph at times especially across southern New Mexico
and the TransPecos/far west Texas.  This flow will occur within a
continued dry airmass across the region, and surface RH values are
expected to fall to around 3-15% in many areas.  A second
consecutive day of extremely dry atmospheric conditions should help
cure fuels even further, suggesting elevated to critical
fire-weather across the region.  At this time, the critical
delineation highlights areas containing the strongest surface winds
(which may exceed 30 mph at times in the TransPecos) amid critically
dry fuels and very low RH.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA...SOUTHERN
NEW MEXICO...AND PORTIONS OF WEST TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level flow will amplify substantially across portions of the
southern Rockies/High Plains as a strong mid/upper wave traverses
New Mexico today.  70-90 kt 500mb wind speeds are expected within a
jet stream expected to traverse the region.  Meanwhile at the
surface, a low will organize over southeastern New Mexico and deepen
quickly upon approach toward southwestern Oklahoma overnight.  To
the west of this low and south of a trailing cold front across
east-central New Mexico, a very dry airmass will reside along with
very windy conditions, potentially promoting rapid fire spread where
fuels are dry.

...Southeastern Arizona through west Texas...
A corridor of very strong surface flow will develop through peak
heating hours across this region.  Latest high-resolution guidance
suggests areas of 30-40 mph surface winds with gusts perhaps as high
as 70 mph especially in favored terrain areas of the TransPecos.
Meanwhile, insolation/heating amidst a very dry airmass will allow
for several areas of 3-15% RH values during the afternoon - lowest
in west Texas.  Ordinarily, these conditions would support an
extremely critical delineation across some portion of west Texas and
far southern New Mexico, though fuels guidance generally depicts
ERCs that may not support extreme fire behavior.  Thus, this upgrade
is withheld, though rapid fire spread will be possible with any
ignitions this afternoon.

...A strengthening storm system is set to bring unsettled weather,
both wintry and severe in some cases, to the the Nation's
Heartland...

...Low pressure system to produce rain and mountain snow showers
across the Northwest and Intermountain West...

...Critical Risks of fire weather are in place for parts of the
Southwest through Tuesday; mild and dry in the Northeast...

An area of low pressure is set to strengthen throughout the day as
it tracks into the Southern Plains. On the northern/colder side of
the storm, periods of snow will transpire across the southern and
central Rockies and High Plains this morning. Roughly 3-6 inches
of snow are possible in the High Plains of Colorado and New Mexico
with over a foot of snow expected in the higher elevations of
these states. Within the storm's warm sector and along its warm
front, widespread showers and thunderstorms will spread throughout
the Central and Southern Plains where a Marginal Risk for
excessive rainfall has been issued. Some storms could be severe
this afternoon, especially in southern Oklahoma and north Texas
where the Storm Prediction Center has a Slight Risk in place. The
storm heads into the Midwest on Tuesday, bringing showers to the
Upper Mississippi Valley and scattered thunderstorms to the middle
Mississippi River Valley. The lower Mississippi Valley has the
better odds of witnessing severe weather and excessive rainfall
Tuesday afternoon and into Tuesday night.

Farther west, another area of low pressure and its associated cold
front usher in bouts of showers and mountain snow to the Northwest
today. The heaviest snowfall totals are anticipated in the
northern Rockies and in the Cascades where the highest elevations
are forecast to receive over a foot of snow. The cold front
plunges south Monday night and into Tuesday, delivering a fresh
injection of much below normal temperatures to the Great Basin and
Four Corners region on Tuesday. Light snow accumulations are
expected in these regions on Tuesday, but an amplifying upper
trough over the Southwest will result in heavier periods of snow
developing in the southern Rockies Tuesday night into Wednesday
morning.

Elsewhere, fire weather conditions remain at Elevated to Critical
levels in parts of the Southwest today and Tuesday due to blustery
winds and low humidity levels. In the East, a dome of high
pressure stretching from the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast to the
northwest Atlantic ensures pleasantly mild temperatures and mostly
dry conditions stick around through Wednesday morning.

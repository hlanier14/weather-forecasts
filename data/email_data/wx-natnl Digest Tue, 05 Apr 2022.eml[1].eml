Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Mon Apr 04 2022

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN WYOMING...SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN SOUTH DAKOTA...WESTERN NEBRASKA AND NORTHERN NEBRASKA....

Expanded the critical area eastward into south-central South Dakota
and north-central Nebraska. Relative humidity will not be as dry in
this area (20 to 25 percent), but winds are forecast to be sustained
around 25 mph and fuels are very dry in this region. Elsewhere, no
changes were necessary.

..Bentley.. 04/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CDT Mon Apr 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist across parts of the High Plains
today as a strong upper-level jet begins to nose into the Pacific
Northwest. Critical fire weather conditions are most likely across
parts of eastern WY and western NE, but elevated conditions are
probable for parts of the western Dakotas, MT, and far southwest TX.

...Northern High Plains...
The latest observations from northern MT and AB/SK show surface
pressure falls indicating a deepening lee trough as an upper-level
jet begins to shift into the Pacific Northwest. This trend will
continue through the day and the resulting mass response will
support widespread winds between 15-25 mph along the northern High
Plains. An antecedent dry air mass (dewpoints in the single digits
to low teens) will maintain reduced RH values this afternoon via
diurnal warming and some degree of downslope warming/drying. Latest
ensemble guidance has maintained reasonably high probabilities for
critical wind/RH conditions across eastern WY into the NE Panhandle.
Locations in the immediate lee of terrain features may see periods
of extremely critical wind/RH conditions with sustained winds near
30 mph, gusting to 35-45 mph at times.

...Southwest Texas...
Early-morning surface observations from the Trans Pecos region and
southeast NM show westerly winds on the west side of a diffuse cold
front/surface trough. This boundary will migrate east through the
day as a weak surface low consolidates in northwest TX. Westerly
downslope winds will increase to 15-20 mph across the Trans Pecos
and Rio Grande River Valley to the Big Bend region. Upstream
dewpoints in the single digits and low teens will advect into the
region and support RH reductions into the teens. Consequently,
elevated fire weather conditions appear probable along the Rio
Grande to the Big Bend region where fuels remain very dry and are
receptive to fire spread.

...South-Central Appalachians...
Dry conditions are expected to persist across the south-central
Appalachians with RH values falling into the 25-35% range by the
late afternoon. Breezy gradient winds between 10-15 mph may support
brief periods of elevated fire weather conditions. Given the dry
fuels over the region, this may support a low-end fire weather
concern.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 04 2022

SYNOPSIS: A rapid change in the mid-level height pattern is predicted acros=
s
North America late in the week-1 period, with mid-level low (high) pressure
becoming dominant across the western (eastern) contiguous U.S. at the outse=
t
of
week-2. This favors anomalously cold temperatures over much of the western
lower-48, while portions of the Eastern Seaboard may experience more
summer-like weather. Surface low pressure forecast to eject out of the Rock=
ies
early in the period, combined with the sharp temperature contrast predicted
between the western and eastern contiguous U.S., increases the potential fo=
r
storminess over the Mississippi Valley and surrounding regions. Colder air =
on
the northwestern side of the system may lead to a round of heavy snow acros=
s
parts of the Northern and Central Rockies and Plains. Easterly surface flow=
 is
indicated across Alaska, favoring increased chances for below normal
temperatures over most of the state.

Northern
Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Northern Plains, Tue-Thu, Apr 12-14.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of Californ=
ia,
the Desert Southwest, Central Great Basin, and Central and Southern Rockies
and

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 07 - MONDAY APRIL 11:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 12 - MONDAY APRIL 18: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles all support a rapid flip of the 500-hPa height pattern across the
CONUS between week-1 and week-2. By the outset of week-2, an amplified heig=
ht
pattern is forecast, with anomalous troughing (ridging) depicted across the
West (East). This is consistent with a forecast negative phase of the
Pacific-North American Pattern (PNA), as well as the ongoing La Nina. As a
result, anomalously cold temperatures are predicted across much of the west=
ern
half of the CONUS, with the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depicting at le=
ast
a 20 percent chance that minimum temperatures drop below the 15th percentil=
e
and freezing over the region, and shifting toward the Central CONUS and Upp=
er
Mississippi Valley later in the period. A broad slight risk for much below
normal temperatures is indicated for much of the western and north-central
CONUS for all of week-2. Both reforecast tools, and more so the ECMWF,
indicate
higher probabilities for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
climatological percentile (>40 percent) across portions of the Northern Gre=
at
Basin, Rockies, and Plains, as well as further south across parts of Centra=
l
California, the Desert Southwest, and Four Corners Region. For these areas,=
 a
moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is highlighted from 4/12-
4/14,
with minimum temperatures in the single digits and teens deg F favored acro=
ss
high elevation areas of the Northern Rockies and Great Basin, and minimum
temperatures in the 20s and 30s deg F forecast across parts of the
southwestern
CONUS.



Conversely, the increased ridging in the East favors a quick transition to
above normal temperatures, with a summer-like preview possible across the
Eastern Seaboard early in week-2. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts at leas=
t a
20 percent chance maximum temperatures exceed 85 deg F over most of the
Mid-Atlantic, extending north through the New York City area, with the GEFS
confining these enhanced probabilities mainly across Virginia. For many of
these areas, this would be the first significant warming of the season, and
while temperatures in the 80s deg F would certainly not be considered
hazardous
in the middle of summer, consideration was given due to it being only
mid-April, and also the very quick transition from a reletively colder patt=
ern
to a much warmer pattern in the East may increase health related impacts am=
ong
more sensitive groups. For this reason, a slight risk of much above normal
temperatures is indicated across portions of the Mid-Atlantic for 4/12-4/14=
.
Abnormally dry, to in some cases moderate drought, is ongoing across the
region, and it is possible that an extended period of anomalously warm weat=
her
could result in an expansion of these drought conditions, especially given
that
the heaviest precipitation totals are favored upstream.



Anomalously warm temperatures are also possible across portions of southern
Texas early in week-2, underneath increased deep southerly flow ahead of
troughing to the west, and also due to very dry conditions over the region
favoring increased surface heating. Uncalibrated guidance from the ECMWF an=
d
GEFS ensemble indicate maximum temperatures in the 95-100 deg F range over =
the
region, with the corresponding reforecast tools also depicting elevated
chances
for daytime temperatures exceeding 95 deg F. Therefore, a slight risk of mu=
ch
above normal temperatures is highlighted across southern Texas from 4/12-4/=
13.
Above normal temperatures, combined with forecast increased wind speeds and
severe to exceptional drought conditions observed in the Southern Plains, a=
re
likely to increase the potential for wildfires in the region. Temperatures =
are
predicted to moderate as the troughing shifts more to the east by the middl=
e
of
week-2.



Troughing over the West, along with the tight temperature gradient predicte=
d
between the western and eastern CONUS, favors one or more areas of surface =
low
pressure to eject out of the Rockies and track across the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley during the week-2 period. The ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian
ensembles all depict such a system early in the period, with a variety of
impacts possible depending on location. Heavy rain and frontally focused
convection would be possible across the east-central CONUS in the warm-sect=
or,
with a potential late-season snowstorm possible on the northwestern flank o=
f
the storm track, across the Northern and Central Rockies and Plains. A slig=
ht
risk of heavy precipitation is highlighted over much of the east-central CO=
NUS
for the entire period, to not only account for this initial system, but als=
o
for additional surface lows that may develop later in the period. The ECMWF
and
GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance 3-day
precipitation
exceeds the 85th climatological percentile and 1-inch early in the period,
with
the ECMWF continuing these elevated probabilities throughout the period. A
moderate risk for heavy precipitation is posted across portions of the Midd=
le
and Lower Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys from 4/12-4/14 given the
good model agreement regarding the initial surface low pressure and increas=
ed
potential for convective precipitation and thunderstorms over these areas,
despite lower probabilities for reaching hazards thresholds in the reforeca=
st
tools. Additionally, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted across Northern =
and
Central portions of the Rockies and Plains from 4/12-4/14 to account for
increased potential for snow to the northwest of the storm track, and where
the
GEFS reforecast tool depicts around a 40 percent chance snow water equivale=
nt
exceeds the 67th climatological percentile early in week-2. Following recen=
t
runoff from snowmelt, spring flooding is ongoing along portions of the Red
River of the North and the Illinois River, and is expected to continue into
week-2 due to additional precipitation forecast over both regions. Therefor=
e,
a
flooding possible hazard is indicated over parts of these river valleys.



Increased wind speeds will also be possible ahead of the troughing to the
West,
with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting at least a 20 percent
chance
wind speeds exceed the 85th climatological percentile and 25-mph across par=
ts
of the Desert Southwest, Great Plains, Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, a=
nd
Southeast early in the period given anomalous southerly flow predicted.
Synoptically, surface low formation in the lee of the Rockies is likely to
exacerbate wind speeds over the Great Plains, with some consideration for a
moderate risk. However, the strongest pressure gradient in the ECMWF and GE=
FS
ensemble means is more evident on days 6 and 7, before shifting more east b=
y
day-8. Therefore, only a slight risk for high wind speeds is highlighted fr=
om
4/12-4/14, with possible increase in the wildfire potential across the drou=
ght
stricken areas of the Great Plains, including the aforementioned relatively
hotter areas of southern Texas.



Strong easterly surface flow is forecast over much of Alaska during week-2,
supporting cold, Arctic air advecting into the state. A slight risk of much
below normal temperatures is posted for much of the southern two-thirds of
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle for all of week-2, where the GEFS and ECM=
WF
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20 percent chance minimum temperatures
fall below the 10th climatological percentile, with uncalibrated guidance
depicting minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F in some areas=
.
While temperatures are not expected to be as cold as during the peak of
winter,
an extended period of anomalously cold temperatures during mid-April is lik=
ely
to slow river ice break up across Alaska.

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 07 2022 - 12Z Mon Apr 11 2022

...Overview...

Overall, the large scale regime from late this week into early
next week will remain amplified but progression/evolution during
the period will essentially lead to a flip of the upper level
pattern, with an initial western ridge/east-central U.S. trough
ultimately trending toward a western trough/eastern ridge.
Precipitation will steadily decrease in coverage and intensity
over the eastern half of the country while chilly temperatures
will progress from the Plains through East late week through the
weekend.  Meanwhile the West will see much above normal
temperatures late this week, with some daily records possible over
and near California, followed by a cooler trend during the weekend
into early next week while areas of precipitation spread across
the region.  As this occurs, above normal temperatures will shift
into the Plains and eventually parts of the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Based on 00/06 UTC guidance, best clustered guidance from the
latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means provided a good
depiction of consensus days 3-7.  This remains true for most of
the latest 12 UTC guidance. However, a noteable exception is the
12 UTC GFS that is a stark outlier in delaying by 1-2 days
significant upper trough amplification over the West from the
weekend to early next week with the next major shortwave.  This
trend is not supported by other guidance including the 12 UTC
GEFS.

Continuity adjustments were again fairly modest and represented
typical run-to-run detail refinements.  The overall forecast of
the deep eastern upper trough and associated surface evolution is
fairly consistent.  The majority cluster maintains good definition
of the embedded upper low into day 4 Friday, followed by solutions
showing varying ways in which it may weaken/open up.  UKMET runs
have been the fast extreme with shortwave energy on the east side
of the trough and thus with the Mid-Atlantic through New England
coastal wave, but is beginning to trend favorably.  The
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean are a bit on the slower side.  An
intermediate solution continues to look good for depicting the
specifics of the upper trough and surface reflection.  Forecasts
of the upper trough reaching the West have been a bit more varied,
due in part to involvement of separate shortwaves. However, but
with the aforementioned exception of the 12 UTC GFS, recent
GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs still overall compare favorably to each other
and the ensemble means.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Heaviest rainfall with the system affecting the eastern half of
the country should be Thursday into Friday and focused by the
triple point wave lifting from the Mid-Atlantic into New England.
Specifics within this area of potentially enhanced rain are still
uncertain, with additional time needed to resolve important
details.  Some pockets of locally moderate to heavy rainfall could
extend along the trailing front as far south as Florida, and the
Storm Prediction Center is monitoring severe potential over parts
of the Mid-Atlantic.  Check SPC's outlooks for the latest
information on severe threats.  Precipitation in the vicinity of
the Great Lakes low should trend lighter after midweek.  However
cold air aloft associated with the upper trough will likely
promote areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the Midwest into
the northern half to two-thirds of the East into Friday-Saturday.
Some precipitation could be in the form of snow between the
Midwest and Appalachians.  The upper trough amplifying over the
West will gradually increase the coverage of mostly light to
moderate rain and higher elevation snow from late week onward.
Most of this precipitation should be over the northern half of the
region into early Monday but may push farther south thereafter.

The upper ridge over the West late this week will produce well
above normal temperatures across the region. Forecasts continue to
show highs reaching 15-25F above normal Thursday-Friday from parts
of California and Oregon into the Great Basin along with some
daily records for highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough arriving
from the Pacific will bring in cooler air, with the Northwest
trending below normal during the weekend and much of the West
likely to see highs 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile
highs of 5-15F or slightly more below normal will progress from
the Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East late week into the
weekend.  A trailing warming trend will bring plus 10-20F
anomalies into the Plains for the weekend and persisting over some
areas into Monday while eastern U.S. readings rebound closer to or
slightly above normal by early next week.

of California and Oregon into the Great Basin along with some
daily records for highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough arriving
from the Pacific will bring in cooler air, with the Northwest
trending below normal during the weekend and much of the West
likely to see highs 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile
highs of 5-15F or slightly more below normal will progress from
the Plains/Mississippi Valley into the East late week into the
weekend.  A trailing warming trend will bring plus 10-20F
anomalies into the Plains for the weekend and persisting over some
areas into Monday while eastern U.S. readings rebound closer to or
slightly above normal by early next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon April 04 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 10 - 14 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An amplified ridge and associated above normal 500-hPa
heights
are predicted over the Bering Sea and Mainland Alaska extending southward t=
o
the Gulf of Alaska. A deep trough associated with below normal 500-hPa heig=
hts
are forecast over the western and central CONUS. Ridging with above normal
500-hPa heights are predicted to be situated over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the western half of the CONUS
underneath enhanced northerly mid-level flow. Ridging and above normal
500-hPaheights lead to increased odds of near to above normal temperatures =
for
much of the central and eastern CONUS except for the Florida Peninsula wher=
e
below normal temperatures are favored. Below normal temperatures are likely
over Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, while above normal temperatu=
res
are favored over the Aleutians, supported by most of the dynamical forecast
tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the western and central
CONUS
eastward to the Ohio Valley, due to a predicted deep trough over the wester=
n
CONUS. Below normal precipitation is most likely for much of the East Coast=
 of
the CONUS, associated with predicted riding over the eastern CONUS. Predict=
ed
mid-level ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights  favor below normal
precipitation over Alaska except for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska
where above normal precipitation is slightly favored, consistent with the
consolidation precipitation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and =
in
the forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 12 - 18 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the predicted week-2 mean 500-hPa circulation
pattern features below normal heights associated with deep troughing foreca=
st
over the western and central CONUS. Conversely, ridging and associated
positive
500-hPa heights anomalies are forecast over the eastern CONUS. Ridging and
above normal 500-hPa heights are also forecast over the Bering Sea, the
Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska extending southward into the adjacent
North Pacific.

Below normal temperatures are likely over the western and central CONNS,
underneath the predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Ridgin=
g
and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of near to above
normal temperatures for much of the eastern CONUS. Elevated probabilities o=
f
below normal temperatures are forecast over Alaska, supported by most of th=
e
dynamical forecast tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the central and eastern
CONUS, due to a predicted trough over the central CONUS and likelihood for =
a
robust return flow of Gulf moisture advecting northward to the west of surf=
ace
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Above normal precipitation is
slightly favored across the Alaska Panhandle and parts of the Pacific
Northwest, while below normal precipitation is more likely over parts of
California, Nevada, New Mexico and western Texas, consistent with the
consolidation precipitation tool. Below normal precipitation is most likely
for
the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska associated with predicted ridging
and
above normal 500-hPa Heights.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and =
in
the forecast temperature and precipitation fields in the forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

Expanded the southern critical area northward into southeast
Colorado and the central Plains critical southward along the Front
Range. Critical meteorological conditions are expected across all of
eastern Colorado. However, a quarter to half an inch of rain fell
across portions of south-central Colorado. Therefore, this region
was left out of critical probabilities.

Added a critical delineation across portions of northeast Montana.
Temperatures will be cool tomorrow (in the 40s F), but winds are
forecast to be sustained 30 to 35 mph with gusts over 50 mph and
relative humidity of 20 to 25 percent. This is occurring in a region
with very dry fuels. Therefore, despite the cool conditions, there
will be a threat for large fires across northeast Montana.

..Bentley.. 04/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0238 AM CDT Mon Apr 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will become more widespread across the High
Plains on Tuesday, as an upper-level trough begins to deepen over
the central CONUS and a cold front sweeps to the southeast across
the Plains. Strong downslope flow off the central and southern
Rockies, in the wake of the cold front and behind a deepening
surface low, will support widespread critical conditions along the
High Plains.

...Central High Plains...
Latest forecast guidance continues to show good agreement in the
passage of a surface trough/cold front across the Plains early
Tuesday. Post-frontal winds will likely increase to 15-25 mph in a
dry, deeply mixed air mass. Downslope warming off the central
Rockies will support widespread RH reductions well below 25% across
the central Plains. Drier solutions hint that RH values may fall to
near 15% by late afternoon for parts of eastern WY and western NE.
Forecast soundings suggest boundary-layer mixing may extend up to
700-600 mb, which could allow for wind gusts as high as 40-50 mph by
mid afternoon. Widespread critical conditions appear likely over a
region with dry fuels. A corridor of sustained 30 mph winds speeds
may develop across the WY/CO/NE tri-state region. While confidence
in widespread sub-20% within this corridor is somewhat low (due to
the potential for lingering clouds after isolated morning showers),
periods of extremely critical conditions appear possible.

...Southern High Plains...
A secondary surface low is forecast to deepen across the southern TX
Panhandle into northwest TX through the day Tuesday. Behind this low
and an attendant surface trough, westerly winds will likely increase
to 20-25 mph across a broad swath from southwest TX into eastern NM
and the TX Panhandle. Downslope warming coupled with antecedent dry
conditions will support widespread RH reductions between 10-15% (and
possibly as low as the single digits). A deep, well-mixed boundary
layer with a unidirectional wind profile favors frequent gusts up to
30-40 mph. Widespread critical conditions are expected, and periods
of extremely critical wind/RH conditions are possible from
east-central NM into the southwestern TX Panhandle, where guidance
shows the most favorable overlap of the low-level thermal ridge and
mid-level speed maxima.

...Heavy snowfall likely for the Cascades and northern Rockies,
with widespread gusty winds from the Northwest into the Plains...

...Heavy to excessive rain and severe thunderstorm threat expands
across much of the South for the next couple of days before moving
up the East Coast by Wednesday...

...Critical Fire Weather Risk will expand across portions of the
High Plains with record heat also possible in parts of south Texas
on Tuesday and Wednesday...


A potent low pressure system will bring increasingly active
weather from the Western U.S. and into the Plains over the next
couple of days. Abundant moisture ahead of this system streaming
into the Pacific Northwest will continue to bring showers and
thunderstorms, along with gusty winds, to coastal regions through
this evening. Meanwhile, heavy snow is expected in the higher
terrain from the Cascades and into the northern Rockies. Snowfall
may be measured in feet over parts of the northern Cascades before
the snow begins to taper off on Tuesday night. As this system
moves into the northern Rockies and High Plains, widespread high
winds are expected to impact these areas and especially the
foothills into Wednesday, periodically accompanied with mixed rain
and snow as the system reorganizes and expands over the northern
Plains. Farther south, showers and thunderstorms are expected to
develop ahead of an intensifying cold front later on Tuesday as it
sweeps across the upper Midwest. The thunderstorms could intensify
further as they reach the western portion of the Great Lakes by
Wednesday morning with strong and gusty winds.

Farther south, a stationary front across south Florida will
maintain a threat for thunderstorms, containing locally heavy
rain, into this evening. Moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will
begin to surge north toward the southern tier states and converge
with a cold front moving into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms
will expand in coverage and intensify this evening and into
Tuesday across eastern Oklahoma and Texas and into the lower
Mississippi Valley. As the warm front lifts across the south,
expect storms to spread into the Deep South and the Southeast
Tuesday and Wednesday. Given ample instability, severe weather as
well as heavy to excessive rainfall are possible. SPC highlights
these regions within a slight to enhanced risk for severe
thunderstorms and WPC has a slight risk for flash flooding. See
the outlooks from SPC and WPC for additional details. Farther
north, showers and storms will also expand into the Mid-Atlantic
states Tuesday into Wednesday. A compact low pressure system is
forecast to intensify near the Carolina coast by Wednesday morning
with a period of enhanced rainfall and gusty winds near its track.

Fire weather will also become an increasing threat across the High
Plains as very dry conditions and gusty winds behind the
developing storm system into the Central/Eastern U.S.. SPC shows
and elevated to critical fire weather threat through Tuesday and
into Wednesday all the way from northeast Montana southward to
West Texas and eastern New Mexico.

In terms of temperatures across the CONUS over the short range
period, well above average highs are likely Tuesday across much of
the Southern Plains, with widespread 80s and 90s (possibly
reaching near 100 in south Texas) and a handful of record high
temperatures possible across Texas. By Wednesday, the warmth moves
into the South and Eastern U.S., with daytime highs as much as 10
to 20 degrees above normal for some places. The cold front across
the West and into the Midwest will usher in much below normal
temperatures across the Rockies on Tuesday and into the
northern/central Plains on Wednesday. Meanwhile, temperatures
across the Southwest and California will trend warmer through the
period underneath of a building upper level ridge.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...

19Z Update: The 12Z guidance suite has a very good overall
depiction of the amplifying pattern as the deep upper trough
builds over the north-central U.S. next week.  Although still
slightly progressive, the 12Z run of the GFS has trended closer to
the non-NCEP model consensus, and therefore a deterministic model
blend sufficed as a good starting point in the forecast process.
However, differences are more apparent for the northwestern U.S.
as the next system approaches, with the GFS well ahead of the
model consensus by Friday, and a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS blend approach
works well for the West Coast region.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall threat across the Deep South and Gulf Coast region, the
corridor of heaviest rainfall is favored from the Red River Valley
of TX/OK eastward to central AL and the southern Appalachians,
with some scattered 3+ inch totals within the realm of
possibility.  Multiple rounds of strong to severe storms and
likely a squall line are also expected across many of these same
areas.  The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick
--------------------

...Overview...

The large scale pattern will undergo a dramatic change over the
course of the period, as fairly low-amplitude progressive flow
leading into the start of the period early Monday transitions to a
western ridge/east-central U.S. upper trough with a closed low
currently expected to track from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes by around Wednesday-Friday.  A strong jet arriving
into the Northwest early in the week will initially focus heavy
precipitation over that part of the country and then the
developing upper trough/associated surface evolution will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern half of the lower 48 with
heaviest totals forecast to be across the South.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another episode of unseasonably
warm temperatures to that part of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and means offer good agreement with the overall
pattern evolution while exhibiting some typical detail differences
that have medium to low predictability.  Of particular note,
latest GFS runs have been on the southern side of the spread for
the upper low that tracks over the Plains and Midwest late Tuesday
through Wednesday and GFS runs have tended to be more eager to
bring Pacific shortwave energy into the northern part of the
western ridge late in the period (which the new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted toward).  As the main system of interest reaches the East
late in the week, differences are fairly modest for a days 6-7
forecast with the GFS/GEFS slightly northeast of the ECMWF/CMC and
their means.  A starting point consisting of a 12Z/18Z model blend
early and then a model/ensemble mean blend later on provided a
good intermediate solution with only modest refinements to
continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong upper jet pushing into the Northwest early next week will
bring an episode of enhanced coastal/terrain rain and mountain
snow to the Pacific Northwest with significant totals extending
into the northern Rockies.  After this moisture departs, the upper
ridge building into the West will bring dry weather to much of the
region Wednesday-Friday.  Downstream upper trough amplification
and surface low/front evolution will promote active weather over
the central/eastern U.S.  With typical run-to-run refinements and
some spread in the details, there is a persistent signal for heavy
rainfall potential from near the southeastern Plains into the
Southeast during the first half of the week.  This region has the
best overlap of moist Gulf inflow and instability, along with
focus from a couple surface fronts.  The Storm Prediction Center
is also monitoring this system for strong to severe convection,
with more details forthcoming as predictability improves over
future guidance runs.  Other parts of the central/eastern U.S.
could see pockets of locally moderate to heavy rain as well.
Meanwhile some snow could be possible along the northern tier, on
the cold side of the upper low track, as well as into parts of New
England.

The upper ridge building into the West will support another period
of well above normal temperatures across the region by
Wednesday-Friday.  The greatest anomalies for daytime highs should
be from California and southern Oregon into the Great Basin, with
highs 10-20F above normal and some locations reaching 20-25F above
normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible
late in the week.  Ahead of the ridge, cool air under the
amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to 5-15F below
normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday and progressing into
the east-central U.S. by Friday.  Leading warm/moist flow ahead of
the upper trough/surface system will bring a couple days of above
normal readings (especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...

19Z Update: The 12Z guidance suite has a very good overall
depiction of the amplifying pattern as the deep upper trough
builds over the north-central U.S. next week.  Although still
slightly progressive, the 12Z run of the GFS has trended closer to
the non-NCEP model consensus, and therefore a deterministic model
blend sufficed as a good starting point in the forecast process.
However, differences are more apparent for the northwestern U.S.
as the next system approaches, with the GFS well ahead of the
model consensus by Friday, and a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS blend approach
works well for the West Coast region.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall threat across the Deep South and Gulf Coast region, the
corridor of heaviest rainfall is favored from the Red River Valley
of TX/OK eastward to central AL and the southern Appalachians,
with some scattered 3+ inch totals within the realm of
possibility.  Multiple rounds of strong to severe storms and
likely a squall line are also expected across many of these same
areas.  The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0120 AM CDT Tue Apr 05 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST MONTANA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather threats are expected to increase this afternoon along
much of the High Plains. A strong upper-level jet is noted in
early-morning water vapor imagery and latest RAP analyses across the
Pacific Northwest. This features will dig slightly into the central
Plains through the day and help shift a strong surface low, noted in
the lee of the northern Rockies, into the upper MS river valley by
late afternoon. An attendant cold front will sweep southeast across
the Plains this morning with a continental air mass in its wake,
resulting in widespread dry, windy conditions.

...Central High Plains...
Latest surface observations from eastern WY already show strong
downslope 25-30 mph winds on the west side of the lee trough. These
conditions are yielding poor overnight RH recovery with RH values
holding steady in the 30-35% range. As the cold front pushes east
this morning, downslope winds will become more widespread across the
central Plains. Latest guidance continues to show high probability
for widespread sustained 20-30 mph winds from the Dakotas into
northern KS. Deep boundary-layer mixing up to 700-600 mb and a
unidirectional wind profile will support the potential for 40-50 mph
wind gusts - especially over the NE/CO/WY tri-state region where the
strongest low to mid-level flow is expected. Despite the deep
mixing, cold advection and scattered cloud cover (and potentially
light showers) may limit overall RH reductions. RH values may drop
into the 15-20% range under persistent cloud breaks, but 20-25% RH
values appear more probable. Given very receptive fuels over the
region, widespread critical, and localized extremely critical,
conditions are expected.

...Southern High Plains...
A secondary surface low is expected to deepen over western
OK/northwest TX through the afternoon. 20-25 mph westerly winds
behind the low and attendant dryline will have trajectories
emanating from the southern Rockies. Downslope warming and drying
will support widespread critical conditions as RH values fall into
the low teens. Extremely critical conditions are possible across far
eastern NM and the southwestern TX Panhandle where the overlap of
the low-level thermal ridge and 850-700 mb wind maxima will be
maximized. However, poor ensemble probabilities for sustained 30+
mph winds suggests such conditions will be localized and brief.
Portions of northwest TX within the Critical risk area have received
well over 0.5 inches of rain over the past 24 hours, which has
likely mitigated fuel receptiveness to a degree. However, the
critical wind/RH conditions will support fire spread outside of the
narrow swaths that received higher amounts.

...Northern Montana...
Widespread 20-30 mph winds (gusting to 50+ mph at times) are
expected behind the cold front by early afternoon. Due to cold air
advection and lingering cloud cover, RH reductions are expected to
be meager, falling to 25-35%. Despite this, very dry fuels combined
with strong winds will support critical fire weather concerns this
afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Tue Apr 05 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 08 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 12 2022

...Overview...

Today's guidance is consistent in advertising a dramatic switch in
the amplified upper level pattern from late this week into next
week, with an initial western ridge/eastern trough ultimately
evolving to a western trough/eastern ridge.  This evolution will
lead to some dramatic temperature changes during the period as
much above normal temperatures over the West on Friday trend
toward well below normal readings by the first part of next week
and chilly temperatures over the eastern half of the country
Friday into the weekend rebound to above normal levels by early
next week.  Meanwhile rain and higher elevation snow will spread
over the West and low level Gulf inflow should eventually
contribute to rainfall over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity.
A showery pattern over the East during Friday-Saturday under the
upper trough should give way to drier weather thereafter.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

12Z/18Z operational models were in good agreement for most aspects
of the forecast during the first half of the period.  The main
exception was with the 18Z GFS depiction of a questionably strong
shortwave (with an embedded upper low) crossing the northern
Plains and southern Canada around Sunday.  Recently there have
been some modest trends toward more height falls reaching across
the northern tier and southern Canada, pushing the Plains cold
front a little farther southeast, but the 18Z GFS specifics have
minimal support from other model/ensemble guidance.  The new 00Z
GFS shows favorable trends.  Consensus still shows an upper low
over the Great Lakes as of Friday, followed by uncertainty over
exactly how the core of the upper trough will evolve as it lifts
out.  The updated forecast using an operational model composite
kept 18Z GFS weight low enough to minimize the questionable
details over the northern Plains by Sunday.

From late weekend through next Tuesday the primary focus of the
forecast will be the deepening upper trough over the West, with a
potential embedded Great Basin upper low originating from energy
over the Gulf of Alaska at the start of the period.  Recent
ECMWF/CMC runs have been fairly consistent with this evolution, as
have the ensemble means.  The 18Z and 00Z GFS runs look better
after the 12Z run was suspiciously slow to bring this energy into
the West.  Farther east there is some spread for how shortwave
energy may round the eastern ridge, with effects on a surface
front expected to extend from the Plains into the Great Lakes (and
possibly beyond) by day 7 Tuesday.  A blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z
ECMWF-CMC and 18Z GEFS/ECMWF mean represented the consensus well
while accounting for typically increasing detail uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper trough amplifying into the West will spread rain and
higher elevation snow across northern and central parts of the
region, eventually reaching some southern areas late in the
period.  Best potential for some enhancement beyond light/moderate
activity will be over favored terrain in the Cascades late this
week into the weekend and then the northern-central Rockies by
Sunday-Monday and possibly into Tuesday.  Low level upslope flow
may add to precipitation totals along the Rockies.  Farther east,
expect rain to develop over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity
during the first half of next week with an increasing flow of Gulf
moisture.  The main area of organized rainfall with the broad
system affecting the East late this week should depart from New
England on Friday with the northward progression of a frontal
wave.  However cold air aloft associated with the upper trough
will likely promote areas of diurnally enhanced showers from the
Midwest into the northern half to two-thirds of the East into
Friday-Saturday.  Some precipitation could be in the form of snow
between the Midwest and Appalachians.

The West will see one more day of very warm to hot temperatures on
Friday with highs reaching 15-25F above normal especially from
California into the Great Basin, with some daily records for
highs/warm lows. Then the upper trough steadily deepening over the
region will bring a pronounced cooling trend.  Much of the
Northwest/northern Rockies may see highs of 10-15F below normal by
Sunday and highs of 10-20F below normal should be common over a
majority of the West as well as northern High Plains by next
Tuesday.  Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend
from mostly below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F
anomalies) Friday-Saturday to above normal readings (plus 5-15F
anomalies) from west to east by next Sunday-Tuesday.

259 AM EDT Tue Apr 05 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 08 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 12 2022

...Overview...

Today's guidance is consistent in advertising a dramatic switch in
the amplified upper level pattern from late this week into next
week, with an initial western ridge/eastern trough ultimately
evolving to a western trough/eastern ridge.  This evolution will
lead to some dramatic temperature changes during the period as
much above normal temperatures over the West on Friday trend
toward well below normal readings by the first part of next week
and chilly temperatures over the eastern half of the country
Friday into the weekend rebound to above normal levels by early
next week.  Meanwhile rain and higher elevation snow will spread
over the West and low level Gulf inflow should eventually
contribute to rainfall over the Mississippi Valley and vicinity.
A showery pattern over the East during Friday-Saturday under the
upper trough should give way to drier weather thereafter.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

12Z/18Z operational models were in good agreement for most aspects
of the forecast during the first half of the period.  The main
exception was with the 18Z GFS depiction of a questionably strong
shortwave (with an embedded upper low) crossing the northern
Plains and southern Canada around Sunday.  Recently there have
been some modest trends toward more height falls reaching across
the northern tier and southern Canada, pushing the Plains cold
front a little farther southeast, but the 18Z GFS specifics have
minimal support from other model/ensemble guidance.  The new 00Z
GFS shows favorable trends.  Consensus still shows an upper low
over the Great Lakes as of Friday, followed by uncertainty over
exactly how the core of the upper trough will evolve as it lifts
out.  The updated forecast using an operational model composite
kept 18Z GFS weight low enough to minimize the questionable
details over the northern Plains by Sunday.

From late weekend through next Tuesday the primary focus of the
forecast will be the deepening upper trough over the West, with a
potential embedded Great Basin upper low originating from energy
over the Gulf of Alaska at the start of the period.  Recent
ECMWF/CMC runs have been fairly consistent with this evolution, as
have the ensemble means.  The 18Z and 00Z GFS runs look better
after the 12Z run was suspiciously slow to bring this energy into
the West.  Farther east there is some spread for how shortwave
energy may round the eastern ridge, with effects on a surface
front expected to extend from the Plains into the Great Lakes (and
possibly beyond) by day 7 Tuesday.  A blend of the 18Z GFS/12Z
ECMWF-CMC and 18Z GEFS/ECMWF mean represented the consensus well
while accounting for typically increasing detail uncertainty.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper trough amplifying into the West will spread rain and
higher elevation snow across northern and central parts of the
region, eventually reaching some southern areas late in the
period.  Best potential for some enhancement beyond light/moderate
activity will be over favored terrain in the Cascades late this

Friday-Saturday.  Some precipitation could be in the form of snow
between the Midwest and Appalachians.

Tuesday.  Meanwhile the eastern half of the country will trend
from mostly below normal temperatures (up to minus 10-20F
anomalies) Friday-Saturday to above normal readings (plus 5-15F
anomalies) from west to east by next Sunday-Tuesday.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently moving into the northern Rockies is
forecast to amplify over the central Plains and upper MS River
Valley over the next 48 hours as an attendant surface low occludes
over MN. A tight pressure gradient across the Plains will maintain
strong northwesterly low to mid-level flow from west TX into the
Dakotas Wednesday afternoon. These strong winds, combined with dry
conditions, will support another day of widespread fire weather
concerns for parts of the High Plains.

...Central to southern High Plains...
Ensemble guidance continues to show high probability for 20-30 mph
sustained wind across much of the high Plains. Cold advection and
mid-level clouds will mute diurnal RH reductions for most locations
north of northeast CO and northern KS. Further south, limited cloud
cover and a stronger downslope wind component off the central
Rockies will yield RH reductions into the 15-25% range. Deep mixing
up to 700 mb should allow for frequent wind gusts up to 35-45 mph by
late afternoon, which may support periods of extremely critical fire
weather conditions from far southeast CO into the OK/TX Panhandles
where RH values may fall to near 10%. Given antecedent dry fuel
status across much of the region, elevated to critical fire weather
conditions appear likely.

...New Mexico...
Regional pressure gradient winds will gradually increase through the
day as a surface high builds across the northern Great Basin.
Sustained 15-25 mph winds will likely see frequent gusts up to 25-30
mph by late afternoon amid deep diurnal mixing. Fuels across
northwest NM are only modestly receptive, but given the increasing
winds and RH reductions into the single digits to low teens, at
least elevated fire weather concerns are expected. A Critical risk
area may be needed in subsequent outlooks depending on how fuel
status trends over the next 48 hours.

A potent low pressure system in conjunction with a powerful cold
front is currently impacting much of the northern to central
Rockies into the High Plains with high winds gusting to hurricane
force especially  especially near mountain passes and the
foothills.  The high winds will be accompanied with snow, heavy at
times, over the higher elevations this morning before gradually
tapering off tonight into Wednesday morning.  The heaviest snow is
expected to occur farther west along the northern Cascades as the
snow gradually tapers off today with final accumulations likely
measured in feet.  This system will begin to reorganize and expand
its size over the northern Plains as it wraps around and interact
with colder air from Canada.  The mixed rain and snow initially
over the northern Plains is forecast to change over to all snow
and then persist across the eastern portion of the Dakotas into
Minnesota into midweek with strong winds as the system expands its
influence.  By Thursday morning, much of the Plains and the Great
Lakes will be engulfed by this expansive cyclone.

As the cyclone expands over the northern Plains, showers and
thunderstorms are expected to develop ahead of an intensifying
cold front later on today as it sweeps across the upper Midwest.
As the cold front forces its way toward the eastern U.S., showers
and thunderstorms are expected to move through the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley on Wednesday before reaching the Appalachians by
Thursday morning with strong and gusty winds.

Meanwhile, moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is beginning to surge
north toward the southern tier states and is converging with a
cold front moving into the southern Plains. Thunderstorms are
expected to further expand in coverage and intensify today and
advance eastward from the southern Plains through the lower
Mississippi Valley.  As the warm front lifts across the south,
expect storms to spread into the Deep South and the Southeast
Tuesday and Wednesday. Given ample instability, severe weather as
well as heavy to excessive rainfall are possible. SPC highlights
these regions within a slight to enhanced risk for severe
thunderstorms and WPC has a slight risk for flash flooding. See
the outlooks from SPC and WPC for additional details. Farther
north, showers and storms will also expand into the Mid-Atlantic
states Tuesday into Wednesday. A compact low pressure system is
forecast to intensify near the Carolina coast by Wednesday morning
with a period of enhanced rainfall and gusty winds near its track.

Fire weather will also become an increasing threat across the High
Plains as very dry conditions and gusty winds behind the
developing storm system into the Central/Eastern U.S.. SPC shows
and elevated to critical fire weather threat through Tuesday and
into Wednesday all the way from northeast Montana southward to
West Texas and eastern New Mexico.

In terms of temperatures across the CONUS over the short range
period, well above average highs are likely Tuesday across much of
the Southern Plains, with widespread 80s and 90s (possibly
reaching near 100 in south Texas) and a handful of record high
temperatures possible across Texas. By Wednesday, the warmth moves
into the South and Eastern U.S., with daytime highs as much as 10
to 20 degrees above normal for some places. The cold front across
the West and into the Midwest will usher in much below normal
temperatures across the Rockies on Tuesday and into the
northern/central Plains on Wednesday. Meanwhile, temperatures
across the Southwest and California will trend warmer through the
period underneath of a building upper level ridge.

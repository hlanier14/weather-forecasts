Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1105 AM CDT Sun Apr 17 2022

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS
AND SOUTHWARD ALONG THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES IN CO AND NM...

Much of the previous forecast (see below) remains on track. The only
major change was to extend the Elevated area southward to the
Texas/Mexico border, as the latest surface observations show 15 mph
northwesterly winds and RH dropping below 10 percent. Sunny skies
are in place across the High Plains, which should foster continued
boundary-layer mixing and associated Elevated/Critical dry and windy
conditions through the afternoon.

..Squitieri.. 04/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sun Apr 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low-amplitude midlevel trough and accompanying strong
west-northwesterly flow will overspread the northern and central
Rockies, resulting in a deepening lee trough over the High Plains.
At the surface, low pressure will lift northeastward from western SD
into the Upper MS Valley, while an attendant cold front sweeps
southward across the central and southern High Plains.

...Central High Plains and southward along the lee of the Rockies in
CO and NM...
As the core of the strong/deep west-northwesterly flow impinges on
the central Rockies and adjacent High Plains, diurnal heating will
allow for the strong flow aloft to mix down to the surface. 20-30
mph sustained west-northwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts)
are expected from eastern WY into western NE and northeastern CO
behind the southward-advancing cold front. Here, a relatively cool
airmass could limit RH reductions to an extent, however, the
strong/gusty surface winds and very dry fuels will still result in
critical fire-weather conditions. Along the lee of the Rockies from
central CO into NM, downslope flow amid a warmer/drier antecedent
airmass will favor 10-15 percent minimum RH with 20-25 mph sustained
west-northwesterly surface winds.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post-frontal airmass will be in place across much of the
Mid-Atlantic (minimum RH of 20-30 percent), however, generally light
surface winds are expected where the lowest RH will develop.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 PM CDT Sun Apr 17 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

Guidance consensus has trended slightly moister across western Iowa,
with minimum RH dipping into the 25-30 percent range. Despite the
slightly higher RH and 0.25-0.5 inch rainfall accumulations within
the past week, the UNL Drought Monitor still indicates the region to
be under a moderate to severe drought, with GACC observations/fuel
charts showing ERCs exceeding the 90th percentile. The 15-25 mph
sustained northwesterly surface winds atop the very dry finer fuels
should compensate to support Elevated fire weather conditions. The
Elevated area across the Southwest was also expanded southeast to
reflect the latest guidance consensus. A northwest extension of the
Elevated area was also applied across the Lower Colorado River Basin
given indications of greater fuel receptiveness based on
coordination with local WFOs. Otherwise, solidly Elevated to locally
Critical conditions are expected across much of the Southwest
tomorrow. 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 10-15
percent RH by afternoon peak heating should promote at least modest
wildfire-spread potential.

..Squitieri.. 04/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Sun Apr 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge will build over the western CONUS, while modest
westerly midlevel flow persists over the Southwest. Farther east, a
strong midlevel trough will track eastward across the Middle MS
Valley, while breezy northwesterly surface winds develop across the
Middle MO Valley in its wake.

...Southwest into south-central CO...
Modest downslope flow will result in widespread 5-15 percent RH
during the afternoon, where sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds will approach 15 mph. The lack of a tighter surface pressure
gradient and modest midlevel flow should mitigate a higher-end
fire-weather threat, though elevated conditions are still expected.

...Middle MO Valley...
Sustained northwesterly surface winds near 15-25 mph will develop
amid 20-25 percent RH during peak heating. While these conditions
will be near-critical, light rainfall across the region casts
uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat. With that said, the
dry/breezy conditions combined with dry fuels should support at
least elevated conditions.

...Wintry Storm threat from the West to the North-Central U.S.
late week/next weekend...


...Weather Pattern Overview...
The departure of the strong low pressure system from New England
will leave a surface high in its wake across the eastern U.S. on
Wednesday. At the same time, an organizing storm system just north
of the Canadian border will bring a cold front eastward across the
north-central U.S. with a weakening low farther south across the
central Plains. Attention then turns to the western U.S. by Friday
with advent of an amplified upper level trough/frontal system with
an enhanced precipitation focus. The cooling/unsettling system
then works inland over the Intermountain West and leads into later
next weekend development of a potentially strong surface low over
the cooled central/northern Plains to include the threat for heavy
wrapping winds/snow/ice on the northern periphery of the system
and an emerging pre-frontal rainfall/strong convection area
broadly underneath and into the warming/moistening east-central
U.S. Meanwhile, a building downstream upper ridge axis over the
Appalachians may allow closed trough development cut underneath
over southern FL and Cuba to increase/focus next weekend rainfall.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...
The 00/06 UTC model guidance suite appears to have above average
agreement on the main synoptic scale features through Thursday
night. By Friday, the GFS remains more progressive with the axis
of the main trough axis across the western U.S., and this
difference is even more apparent going into Saturday/Sunday across
the High Plains. Meanwhile, the 00 UTC CMC and ECMWF are in close
agreement and depict a closed low evolving over the Southwest by
Friday night, and this also has support from the 00 UTC UKMET.
This amplified and less progressive trend continues through next
weekend, leading into deepening trends with cyclogenesis over the
Plains. This would result in an increased and less progressive QPF
swath compared to the 13 UTC NBM 4.0.
Elements of this deepening system can be traced back to former
Pacific Typhoon Malakas that is currently a deep extratropical low
slamming into the Aleutians. Another deep Pacific low expected
track into the Aleutians then the Gulf of Alaska later week/next
weekend also portends a solution on the more amplified side of the
full guidance envelope downstream over the lower 48. Accordingly,
model preference for the later half of the forecast period for the
WPC medium range product suite was a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS mean blend as
a starting point.

12 UTC models overall remain consistent with this plan. The GFS
trended less progressive and the ECMWF/Canadian slightly more
progressive next weekend, a bit more into common alignment. This
seems to bolster forecast confidence in the threat, albeit with
slightly more progression.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...
In the precipitation department, the West Coast region is expected
to remain active with a strong cold front and onshore flow
directed inland across the mountainous terrain of central and
northern California. This spring event will deliver some highly
beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken areas of California,
with the potential for several inches of rain in some areas next
week, and several feet of snow for the Sierra. Elsewhere across
the continental U.S., improving weather can be expected for the
Northeast as the strong storm system moves out of the region. Deep
warming over the East into next weekend may be tempered from the
Northeast down into the Mid-Atlantic by frontal damming that may
prove slower to erode than shown in the models. Another round of
organized showers and storms are expected to develop across the
central U.S. and extending northward to the Great Lakes through
late week as Gulf moisture is advected northward ahead of the
organizing storm system over the central Plains. Additional
moderate to heavy snow is also expected for portions of the
northern Rockies for Friday and into the weekend, with an
increasing threat for heavy snow to spread and intensify in
particular across the northern High Plains and Dakotas/vicinity
next weekend.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 17 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Late season snow for the Upper Midwest through Monday and
interior Northeast on Tuesday...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley/Central Gulf Coast and Southeast through
Sunday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies and the Central High Plains...

Low pressure over the Northern Plains will slowly move eastward to
the Lower Great Lakes and merge with a second low moving
northeastward from the Southeast by Tuesday morning. The system
will produce coastal/lower elevation rain and higher elevation
snow and rain over parts of the Northern Plains and Upper/Middle
Mississippi Valley by Sunday evening. Overnight Sunday, snow
develops over parts of the Upper Great Lakes/Ohio Valley. On
Monday, the snow moves into the Lower Great Lakes and parts of the
Ohio Valley and Northern Appalachians. Overnight Monday, the snow
moves into Northern New England and Central Appalachians, with
coastal rain over Southern New England. For Tuesday, the snow and
rain continue over parts of the Northeast, northern Mid-Atlantic,
and Eastern Ohio Valley.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low moves out of the Northeast into
Southeastern Canada overnight Sunday. The energy will aid in
producing light snow over parts of Northern New England through
late Sunday night.

Additionally, a front lingers over the Gulf Coast States into the
Southern Plains through Monday morning. As a result, showers and
thunderstorms will develop along the boundary over parts of the
Southeast to the Lower Mississippi Valley. The front will also aid
in destabilizing the atmosphere over the Southern Plains to the
Southeast. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi Valley/Central
Gulf Coast and a Slight Risk over parts of southeast Texas through
Monday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. There will also be a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall with these thunderstorms over the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Central Gulf Coast.

In addition, the excessive rainfall threat develops over the
Southeast on Sunday during the showers and thunderstorms over the
region. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall over the Southeast through Monday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the most
vulnerable. The excessive rainfall threat ends on Monday, and the
severe thunderstorms threat is reduced to a Marginal Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast. Rain with
embedded thunderstorms will continue over parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast on Monday, with the rain dwindling to New
England Coast by Tuesday morning.

Furthermore, overnight Sunday, a front over the Pacific will begin
to move onshore over the Pacific Northwest and move inland to the
Rockies by Tuesday. The system will produce coastal rain and
higher elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California early Monday morning into Tuesday evening. The light
snow expands into the Northern Intermountain Region by Tuesday
morning and parts of the Northern Rockies by Tuesday evening.

Moreover, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
the Southern Rockies into the Central High Plains through Monday
morning. The fire weather hazard is due to gusty winds, dry fuels,
and low humidity. However, the fire weather risk lowers on Monday
to an Elevated Risk over parts of the Southwest to the Southern
Rockies. A second Elevated Risk area is over far eastern Nebraska
and western Iowa. Additionally, upper-level energy over the
Southern Rockies/Southern Plains and moist flow off the Western
Gulf of Mexico will produce showers and thunderstorms over parts
of Southern Plains on Tuesday into Tuesday evening.

***Additional snow and cold weather likely for portions of the
Northern Plains this weekend, and heavy snow in the Sierra on
Thursday***


...Weather Pattern Overview...

A quasi-zonal flow pattern aloft will initially be in place across
much of the central and southern U.S. on Thursday, with a northern
stream shortwave and surface low crossing north of the Great
Lakes.  The pattern becomes more amplified by Friday and into the
weekend as a large synoptic scale trough from the Pacific moves
inland across the Intermountain West, and this will spur surface
cyclogenesis across the Plains by Friday night with showers and
storms developing ahead of the trailing front.  Meanwhile, a
downstream ridge axis builds across the eastern U.S. and results
in a considerable warming trend for the weekend.

...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The 00Z model guidance suite appears to have above average
agreement on the main synoptic scale features through Thursday
night, with just some minor differences in cold front timing
across the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Similar to yesterday, the
the GFS remains more progressive with the axis of the main trough
axis across the central/northern Plains, and definitely stronger
by 12Z Saturday compared to the model consensus.  Meanwhile, the
00Z CMC/ECMWF are in closer agreement and depict a closed low
evolving over the Dakotas by early Sunday, and this also has
support from the 00Z UKMET.  The GFS/GEFS is also farther east
with the downstream upper ridge axis over the Eastern U.S., which
would have implications for the temperature forecasts.  By early
next week, the models are in good agreement on the depiction of
another storm system over the northeast Pacific Ocean, but
considerable model spread is apparent across the Rockies and
western High Plains in the wake of the departing surface low over
the north-central U.S.  A nearly multi-deterministic model blend
was incorporated as a starting point for Thursday, and then more
of the ECMWF/ECENS was used going forward into the weekend along
with some of the CMC and GEFS mean.

...Sensible Weather/Threats...

In the precipitation department, moderate to heavy rain along with
heavy snow in the Sierra will likely be ongoing on Thursday as the
deep upper trough moves inland. This spring event will deliver
some highly beneficial precipitation to drought-stricken areas of
California, with the potential for 1-2+ inches of rain in some
areas of central and northern California, and 1-3 feet of snow for
the higher elevations of the Sierra.

Another round of organized showers and storms are expected to
develop across the central U.S. and extending northward to the
Great Lakes for the end of the week as Gulf moisture is advected
northward ahead of the organizing storm system over the central
Plains.  Additional moderate to heavy snow is also expected for
portions of the northern Rockies for Friday and into the weekend,
with an increasing threat for accumulating snow across the Dakotas
and eastern Montana/Wyoming next weekend, potentially affecting
the same areas that were hammered by the recent blizzard.

In terms of temperatures, a major warming trend is forecast for
much of the eastern half of the nation going into the weekend,
along with increasing humidity levels, in response to deep
southerly flow ahead of the central U.S. storm system.  One of the
caveats in the temperature forecast will be the presence of a back
door cold front near the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast U.S. this
weekend, with potentially a big contrast over a relatively short
distance, so future changes in the forecast are likely.  It will
likely remain uncomfortably cold from Montana to North Dakota and
northern Minnesota with highs running 15-25 degrees below normal.

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge will be situated over the western CONUS, while a
midlevel trough moves eastward across the Upper MS Valley and Great
Lakes region. At the surface, high pressure will encompass most of
the Great Plains, with a tight surface pressure gradient along its
eastern and western peripheries.

...Southwest into the south-central Rockies and High Plains...
Over the Southwest, diurnal heating/mixing will yield 5-15 percent
RH by the afternoon. At the same time, enhanced midlevel flow will
mix down to the surface, resulting in 15-20 mph sustained westerly
surface winds. For the south-central Rockies and adjacent High
Plains, downslope warming/drying and diurnal heating will allow for
15-20 percent RH by peak heating. Here, sustained southerly surface
winds of 15-20 mph will develop in response to the tightening
surface pressure gradient. These meteorological conditions combined
with modestly receptive fuels will support elevated to spotty
critical conditions.

...Middle MO Valley...
Deep/strong northwesterly flow on the backside of the
eastward-advancing midlevel trough will overspread the MO Valley --
where a tight surface pressure gradient will be in place. This will
result in 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid 25-30
percent RH. While the marginal RH reductions cast uncertainty on the
overall fire-weather risk, the strong/gusty winds atop very dry
fuels (ERCs exceeding the 90th percentile) should generally
compensate for this.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF FAR EASTERN ARIZONA...NEW
MEXICO...AND SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO...

...Synopsis...
Enhanced midlevel westerly flow will impinge on the central and
southern Rockies on Tuesday, resulting in a deepening lee trough
over the High Plains.

...Southwest into the south-central Rockies and High Plains...
Downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal heating will result
in widespread 10-15 percent RH across the Southwest into the
south-central Rockies and High Plains. Here, a tight surface
pressure gradient along the southern periphery of the lee troughing
will favor widespread 20-30 mph sustained westerly surface winds.
These conditions, combined with increasingly dry fuels, will support
enhanced fire-weather conditions. While critical meteorological
conditions will be possible into Arizona, fuels are generally not as
receptive to wildfire spread.

...Southern Florida...
Diurnal heating of a dry post-frontal airmass could result in
minimum RH of 20-30 percent over inland areas. However, recent
rainfall and generally light surface winds should mitigate the
fire-weather threat.

A wave of low pressure in the Southeast this morning will track up
the Carolina coast this afternoon and strengthen off the
Mid-Atlantic coast Monday evening. It will strengthen thanks to an
upper trough approaching from the Great Lakes, which is also
responsible for producing light snow accumulations from the Upper
Midwest to the eastern Great Lakes. In the storm's warm sector,
strong-to-severe thunderstorms are possible in the Southeast, most
notably along the Carolina coast and southeast Florida where a
pair of Marginal Risks have been issued by the Storm Prediction
Center. Farther north and west, temperatures are well below normal
throughout the Northeast and on west into the Nation's Heartland,
as evident from the Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories in parts
of the Mid-Atlantic and Central Plains. As the storm tracks up the
Eastern Seaboard this evening, precipitation looks to fall as snow
in the northern Appalachians and will fall heavily at times.
Winter Storm Watches have been posted for parts of Upstate New
York and far northeast Pennsylvania from Monday evening through
Tuesday afternoon with the potential for 5 to 10 inches of snow in
these locations. Treacherous travel conditions are likely in these
areas along with the potential for isolated areas of tree damage
and power outages. Lake effect snow showers will persist on the
backside of the storm as it tracks through northern New England on
Tuesday and temperatures will be cold enough to make it seem as
though the calendar reads "February" and not "April". The same can
be said in the Midwest where daytime temperature anomalies of 15
to 20 degrees below normal are expected on Tuesday.

The other region of the Lower 48 forecast to witness unsettled
weather is the Pacific Northwest as a frontal system passes
overhead today and into Monday night. Heavy mountain snow is
forecast in parts of the Cascades and Sierra Nevada where over a
foot of snow is possible. Along the coasts and in the valleys,
rainfall totals over the next two days look to range between 1-2
inches. In wake of the storm system, cooler than normal
temperatures will spread out across the Northwest while
hit-or-miss rain and snow showers pass overhead. There could be
strong winds in parts of the northern Rockies on Tuesday, which
has led to the issuance of High Wind Watches in parts of northwest
Montana.

Elsewhere, more summer-like temperatures look to engulf much of
the Southwest where high temps in the mid-upper 90s will be
possible in parts of southern California and the Lower Colorado
River Valley. High temperature anomalies will range between 10 to
15 degrees above normal in the Southwest and into the central
Rockies. Temperatures will also warm up dramatically in the
central High Plains with highs soaring into the low 80s by
Tuesday. Meanwhile, favorable fire weather conditions will stick
around in the Southwest, highlighted by a Critical Risk centered
over northern New Mexico and southeast Colorado.

...Tropical Depression Nicholas to supply copious amounts of
rainfall to the central Gulf Coast...

...Passing cold front to trigger showers and thunderstorms from
the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, some of which could be severe
and produce excessive rainfall rates...

...Mid-September heat wave to continue in parts of the Northeast
today, more widespread anomalous heat in the Heartland on
Thursday; Elevated fire weather conditions in the Rockies and High
Plains...

Topical Depression Nicholas is forecast to meander over Louisiana
today and into Thursday, directing plenty of tropical moisture at
the central Gulf Coast. A Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall is
positioned from south-central Louisiana on east to the Florida
Panhandle. Additional rainfall totals of 2-5 inches with localized
totals up to 10 inches possible where training thunderstorms set
up. Thursday features more rounds of heavy showers and
thunderstorms in the Deep South, prompting the issuance of a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall once again along the central
Gulf Coast. As Nicholas continues to weaken, so will rainfall
rates across the Deep South, but lingering areas of showers and
thunderstorms look to stick around the Deep South through the end
of the work-week.

Farther north, a passing cold front is responsible for the
development of showers and thunderstorms from the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys on north into the Northeast today. The areas
most at risk are the Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic where
Slight Risks for both severe weather and Excessive Rainfall have
been issued. Thunderstorms producing Excessive Rainfall rates may
lead to areas of localized flash flooding while severe storms
could contain tornadoes, damaging wind gusts, and hail. As this
front tracks east and weakens on Thursday, a new frontal system
tracking across the North-Central U.S. looks to spawn
thunderstorms across the Upper Midwest, some of which could be
severe. Lastly, the Pacific Northwest may see an uptick in showers
as a Pacific storm system ushers in Pacific moisture late Thursday
into early Friday.

Elsewhere, anomalous mid-September heat maintains a firm grip
throughout much of the Lower 48. Much of the Plains and major
Northeast cities can expect high temps on the order of 10 to 15
degrees above normal. The Northeast cools down to an extent on
Thursday thanks to a cold frontal passage, but daily average
temperature anomalies look to remain above normal. Meanwhile, the
heat only continues to build in the Heartland with high temps
soaring into the low-mid 90s in the central High Plains. In the
West, fire weather remains a concern with Red Flag Warnings posted
for parts of the northern Rockies and High Plains today. Favorable
fire weather conditions look to linger into Thursday with Elevated
Risks posted from the Great Basin and central Rockies to the
northern High Plains.

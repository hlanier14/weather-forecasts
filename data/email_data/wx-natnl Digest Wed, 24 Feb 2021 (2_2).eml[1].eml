...Relative quiet across lower 48 to proceed an active end of the
week for the Deep South...

...A mild Wednesday in the East as colder temperatures return to
the Rockies and Central/Southern Plains...

...Avalanche Warnings in the Northern Rockies...

A low pressure system will glide across the Northeast today before
departing into the Canadian Maritime on Thursday. As a result, a
swath of light snow is expected to stretch from parts of the Upper
Great lakes to the Northern Appalachians. The southern portion of
this frontal system will eventually settle across the southern
tier of the CONUS by Thursday. Areas of moderate snow may develop
over parts of central Colorado Wednesday night as the tail end of
the aforementioned frontal boundary descends through the area. An
area of low pressure will develop along this stationary front and
contribute to the potential for moderate rainfall and
thunderstorms across an aerial swath extending from eastern Texas
to northern Mississippi Thursday night into Friday.

Meanwhile, another low pressure system will bring heavy snow to
the mountains of the Northwest on Thursday and Friday. Parts of
the Cascades (particularly northern portions) will see multiple
feet of new snow, while the Northern Rockies will see up to a foot
of snow with locally higher amounts possible, especially over the
highest peaks. Avalanche Warnings are in effect for parts of the
Northern Rockies (northern Idaho/Montana) where prolonged snowfall
is especially likely.

The eastern U.S. will experience a warm up today before the cold
front sweeps through the region tomorrow. Highs maybe between
15-20 degrees above average for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Tennessee Valley. Meanwhile, temperatures are expected to drop
across the Rockies and the Central/Southern Plains as the tail end
of the east coast system sweeps through Texas and the Southwest
today. The arrival of high pressure over the Rockies on Thursday
will contribute to the anomalously cold air mass that will settle
over parts of eastern New Mexico, southeastern Colorado and the
Texas Panhandle, where highs maybe between 20-30 degrees below
average.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1201 PM CST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. With weak surface troughing
still expected, dry and breezy downslope flow may occur along the
immediate lee of the Sacramento Mountains in New Mexico southward to
the Davis Mountains and higher-terrain areas of the Texas Big Bend
by afternoon peak heating. While Elevated-criteria winds/RH are
likely, the very localized coverage continues to suggest that
Elevated highlights are not currently warranted.

..Squitieri.. 01/15/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CST Sat Jan 15 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of a strong upper trough moving through the Gulf Coast
states, another upstream trough will move through the northern
Rockies and adjacent Plains on Sunday. Weak surface troughing in the
southern High Plains will lead to a fairly quick turn-around to
westerly/southwesterly winds. While the airmass will remain quite
dry, only locally elevated conditions are expected as most areas
will see light winds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
111 PM EST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 18 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022

...Pattern Overview...

A winter storm will be exiting the Northeast as the period begins
while a mean upper ridge works to amplify along/off the West Coast
by mid to later next week. This should force an increasingly
dominant series of northern stream impulses into the north-central
U.S. through the period. The first of which should slide over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the
next quickly on its heels digging farther into the mid-South on
Friday and off the Mid-Atlantic coast on Saturday. These systems
will help carve out and reinforce large mean troughing which
should maintain over the Midwest and East late next week and into
the weekend.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z guidance for today continues to show good
agreement on the overall synoptic set-up through much of the
extended range. There remains some smaller scale detail
uncertainties needing resolving, including timing and amplitude of
the couple of shortwaves reinforcing mean troughing centered
across the Midwest. The late period shortwave into the mid-South
and off the East coast continues to show variability in the models
and has potential for a surface low moving through the Southeast
and off the East Coast. Most of the guidance right now shows a
fairly weak/progressive surface low which should quickly shift
well off into the Atlantic. This system is worth monitoring though
as we get closer in time because it could have wintry weather
impacts for parts of the East Coast, depending on the exact track
and overall strength. Out West, models agree that upper ridging
should amplify through the period. The GFS has been fairly
consistent showing a closed low developing off the southern
California coast around Thursday-Friday next week, but it doesn't
have much support from other pieces of guidance, most of which are
much more progressive with the shortwave into the southern Plains.
The ECMWF also shows a compact upper low breaking off troughing
across the northeast Pacific which may try to weaken the ridge a
bit. Given these small scale details, which don't have a whole lot
of run to run continuity, it seems prudent to lean more on the
ensemble means later in the period.

The WPC forecast for today used a blend of majority deterministic
solutions days 3-5. After that, eliminated the GFS due to its
outlying southern California low, and replaced it with increasing
parts of the ensemble means. This approach afforded a forecast
very close to previous WPC continuity as well.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A significant winter storm is slated to exit New England into to
the Canadian Maritimes by Tuesday, although gusty winds may
continue through the day. Another organized low pressure system
digs into the north-central U.S. behind this with low development
and subsequent track moving eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border into Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the Upper
Midwest, Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally
higher totals expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold
high pressure sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in
the wake of the low. Guidance varies with potential focus, but
suspect the wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain at least modest moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel an emerging area of precipitation over the
Southeast that offers some later next week potential for
overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. There
are some ensemble members which are more robust with
frontal/coastal wave amplitude and precipitation extent across the
region and over the East Coast at these longer time periods. The
main upper trough position is far enough West to not discount this
possibility. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

A warm day on Tuesday across the central part of the nation will
quickly change as a very cold Canadian high pressure digs
southward into the region and eventually the East. Much below
normal temperatures (-15 to -20F) will slide east from the
northern Plains/upper Midwest on Wednesday-Thursday reach the
South and East by next Friday. West of the Rockies should
generally stay near or slightly above normal throughout the week
as upper level ridging becomes anchored over the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
111 PM EST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 18 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022

...Pattern Overview...

A winter storm will be exiting the Northeast as the period begins
while a mean upper ridge works to amplify along/off the West Coast
by mid to later next week. This should force an increasingly
dominant series of northern stream impulses into the north-central
U.S. through the period. The first of which should slide over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast Wednesday and Thursday, with the
next quickly on its heels digging farther into the mid-South on
Friday and off the Mid-Atlantic coast on Saturday. These systems
will help carve out and reinforce large mean troughing which
should maintain over the Midwest and East late next week and into
the weekend.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The latest 00z/06z guidance for today continues to show good
agreement on the overall synoptic set-up through much of the
extended range. There remains some smaller scale detail
uncertainties needing resolving, including timing and amplitude of
the couple of shortwaves reinforcing mean troughing centered
across the Midwest. The late period shortwave into the mid-South
and off the East coast continues to show variability in the models
and has potential for a surface low moving through the Southeast
and off the East Coast. Most of the guidance right now shows a
fairly weak/progressive surface low which should quickly shift
well off into the Atlantic. This system is worth monitoring though
as we get closer in time because it could have wintry weather
impacts for parts of the East Coast, depending on the exact track
and overall strength. Out West, models agree that upper ridging
should amplify through the period. The GFS has been fairly
consistent showing a closed low developing off the southern
California coast around Thursday-Friday next week, but it doesn't
have much support from other pieces of guidance, most of which are
much more progressive with the shortwave into the southern Plains.
The ECMWF also shows a compact upper low breaking off troughing
across the northeast Pacific which may try to weaken the ridge a
bit. Given these small scale details, which don't have a whole lot
of run to run continuity, it seems prudent to lean more on the
ensemble means later in the period.

The WPC forecast for today used a blend of majority deterministic
solutions days 3-5. After that, eliminated the GFS due to its
outlying southern California low, and replaced it with increasing
parts of the ensemble means. This approach afforded a forecast
very close to previous WPC continuity as well.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A significant winter storm is slated to exit New England into to
the Canadian Maritimes by Tuesday, although gusty winds may
continue through the day. Another organized low pressure system
digs into the north-central U.S. behind this with low development
and subsequent track moving eastward along the U.S./Canadian
border into Wed/Thu. This should bring some snow to the Upper
Midwest, Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally
higher totals expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold
high pressure sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in
the wake of the low. Guidance varies with potential focus, but
suspect the wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain at least modest moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel an emerging area of precipitation over the
Southeast that offers some later next week potential for
overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. There
are some ensemble members which are more robust with
frontal/coastal wave amplitude and precipitation extent across the
region and over the East Coast at these longer time periods. The
main upper trough position is far enough West to not discount this
possibility. Meanwhile, The West could see some light
precipitation through the period, particularly over the Pacific
Northwest and into the Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross
the region, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

A warm day on Tuesday across the central part of the nation will
quickly change as a very cold Canadian high pressure digs
southward into the region and eventually the East. Much below
normal temperatures (-15 to -20F) will slide east from the
northern Plains/upper Midwest on Wednesday-Thursday reach the
South and East by next Friday. West of the Rockies should
generally stay near or slightly above normal throughout the week
as upper level ridging becomes anchored over the region.

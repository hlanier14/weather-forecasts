...Coastal winter storm to track away from New England on Sunday...


...Overview...

By the start of the medium range period early Sunday, the deep
system tracking just off the East Coast late this week into the
weekend should reach a position east or northeast of Maine, still
supporting some strong winds even if precipitation tapers off.
This storm will continue moving rapidly away from New England
during the day Sunday. For information on the storm's effects
before early Sunday consult the WPC website for updated Key
Messages and check your local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:=
//weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PM=
Gc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ . Through the
rest of the period the dominant theme will be a significant
pattern change as an upper trough strongly amplifies from the
northeastern Pacific into the western/central U.S. while a strong
ridge builds and then persists over the eastern Pacific while
another ridge crossing the East Coast Tuesday settles over the
western Atlantic thereafter. This evolution will initially spread
precipitation across the West and then likely produce significant
precipitation farther eastward as a leading wavy front interacts
with a strong flow of Gulf moisture. Ahead of the trough, a
southern stream shortwave/upper low may generate some enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

An operational model blend early in the period followed by a
transition toward slightly less than half total weight of 18Z
GEFS/12Z ECMWF means continued to provide a good representation of
consensus ideas with mainly just typical run-to-run detail changes
versus previous cycle. For the storm producing lingering effects
over New England, there are still meaningful differences in the
short range due in part to fine-scale issues with the supporting
upper low so there is still a fair amount of uncertainty over the
exact location/structure of the storm as of early Sunday. Overall
the latest GFS/GEFS mean are on the faster side and the 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean are slowest, conforming to long-historical
tendencies. Meanwhile guidance continues to consolidate for the
handling of the southern stream shortwave/upper low emerging from
the Southwest, with the 00Z UKMET straying faster than most other
solutions. This feature should rapidly shear out beyond the
Plains. Farther west, there are still differences in how some
energy pulls off from the southwestern part of the shortwave
approaching the West Coast Sunday but now with less pronounced
spread than in the past couple cycles. As the larger scale upper
trough digs into the western/central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the
ensemble means and a multi-run average of operational runs suggest
above average predictability for the large-scale feature while
individual members/model runs show embedded detail uncertainties.
Examples of the latter include to what degree flow may separate
near the Four Corners region around Wednesday and the character of
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough by Thursday. The 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF/12Z CMC provided the most appealing operational
components for this trough to go along with the ensemble mean
input. The new 00Z CMC has come in lagging consensus a bit
relative to the better fitting 12Z runs from the past couple days,
though the new 00Z ECMWF has slowed a bit as well.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect strong winds over New England at the start of Sunday to
moderate over the course of the day as strong low pressure tracks
rapidly away from the region. Otherwise the effects of this storm
will be in the short range. See the WPC website for latest Key
Messages on the system and additional information in the
Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion, plus check your
local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA=
!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

The upper trough/low reaching the Southwest by early Sunday should
produce little if any precipitation over that region. However as
the feature continues eastward, there will be some potential for
locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas across parts
of the Gulf Coast region during the first half of the week. Best
potential at this time appears to be over eastern Texas with lower
confidence in details farther east. Some aspects of this event may
hinge on small-scale details not easily resolved very far in
advance. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Sunday-Tuesday will spread moderate amounts of rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward and
southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest totals are likely
to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be too extreme. In
general the forecast remains on track for a significant increase
of coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central
U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading wavy front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best potential for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Wintry weather
will be possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield,
with at least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details in the colder air may be more dependent on
lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave energy and frontal
waves.

Cold conditions near the East Coast will extend through Sunday
with many areas 10-20F below normal. Subfreezing lows should
extend into portions of Florida and parts of the Florida Peninsula
may challenge daily records for both morning lows and daytime
highs. Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures
Sunday into the first part of next work week, with some
northern/central areas possibly seeing plus 20F or greater
anomalies on one or two days. This warm air will progress into the
eastern half of the country Tuesday-Thursday, bringing a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal and perhaps greater
anomalies for lows over the Northeast by Thursday. Also during
Tuesday-Thursday much of the West and then into the Plains will
see an episode of chilly temperatures with the Rockies and Plains
seeing the best potential for readings 10-20F below normal.

...A reinforcing surge of arctic air will engulf the eastern half
of the nation during the next couple of days...

...An area of light snow is forecast to develop over the
Mid-Atlantic and central Appalachians as a large coastal storm
forms rapidly off the East Coast...

Under the influence of an arctic high pressure system, much of the
eastern U.S. will be much colder than normal today, with much of
the Northeast remaining well below freezing.  Cold conditions also
extend across the Deep South where a weakening upper-level trough
tracks across the region today.  Meanwhile, the next surge of
arctic air is poised to enter the northern U.S.  Scattered snow
showers are expected to accompany the arctic cold front as it
sweeps across the Great Lakes today and into tonight.  Blustery
northwesterly winds will once again usher sub-zero temperatures
into the upper Midwest by Friday morning.  will also be
responsible for  between Thursday and Thursday night across the
Great Lakes.

Meanwhile, a low pressure wave has become nearly stationary east
of southern Florida.  As the arctic air continues to surge toward
the East Coast on Friday, the stage will be set for the low
pressure wave to intensify rapidly off the southeastern U.S.
Friday night.  Light snow is forecast to develop across the
central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic by Friday afternoon, before
expanding toward the East Coast Friday night.  By Saturday
morning, winds are expected to strength quite a bit up and down
the East Coast as a large low pressure is forecast to intensify
further and tracks northeastward off the coast.

Elsewhere, rain is expected to dampen southern Texas on today as a
fast-moving cold front progresses into northern Mexico to end the
week.

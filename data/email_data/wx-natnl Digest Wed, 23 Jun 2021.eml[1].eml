Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Tue Jun 22 2021

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF SOUTHERN AND EASTERN
GREAT BASIN...

Some modification to the elevated area based on recent guidance. The
critical and dry thunderstorm areas remain unchanged. See the
previous discussion below for more details.

..Wendt.. 06/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Tue Jun 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid-level troughing will move onshore across California today, while
stronger mid-level flow and moisture spread inland over much of the
West. Ridging across the Southwest will move slowly to the east,
while a broad trough will envelop much of the northeastern CONUS.
Warm, dry, and windy surface conditions in the Southern Great Basin
and Southwest will support critical fire weather conditions today.
Thunderstorms over the West may also produce isolated dry lightning
over Oregon and Idaho.

...Southern Great Basin and Southwest...
A corridor of 30-40 kt 500-700 mb flow to the east of the upper low
will spread inland over southern Nevada and central Utah by early
afternoon. Deep mixing will transport stronger momentum aloft to the
surface, supporting winds of 25-30 mph. Widespread relative humidity
below 15% is forecast to develop with warm surface temperatures. Dry
fuels and recent lightning/fire activity suggest enhanced potential
for fire spread. Widespread critical fire weather conditions are
likely from Nevada, through northern Arizona and much of Utah, into
western Colorado.

...Northern Nevada and California...
Stronger flow aloft should be focused across portions of the
northern Great Basin and Intermountain West as the mid-level low
approaches. Gusty downslope flow across the Sierra and high terrain
of the Northwest will overlap with warm and dry surface conditions
across Nevada and northern California. Here, fuels are critically
dry, and recent lightning activity will increase the potential for
fire growth. Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
will be likely through much of the day.

...Northwest and Intermountain West Dry Thunder...
As broad ascent from the mid-level low spreads inland through the
morning, thunderstorms should develop along a gradient of deeper
mid-level moisture from southeast Oregon into central Idaho. Model
soundings show sufficient buoyancy for scattered storms and
subsequent lightning strikes. While storm coverage will be increased
from previous days, higher PWAT values (0.75-1.0 inches) may favor a
storm mode less favorable for efficient lightning starts. Isolated
dry strikes will remain possible over dry fuels through much of the
evening, before storm coverage decreases later tonight.

251 PM EDT Tue Jun 22 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Jun 25 2021 - 12Z Tue Jun 29 2021

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build record temperatures across the
Northwest/West...
...Elongated Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Plains to
Great Lakes...

19Z Update:  There has been a general westward shift in the heavy
rainfall axis from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region
with the 12Z guidance compared to the 00Z guidance.  This is in
response to a stronger western Atlantic upper ridge that will slow
the progress of the cold front and the shortwave impulses along
it.  The 12Z CMC was well to the east of the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means regarding the placement of both the
central U.S. upper trough and also with the Atlantic ridge, so it
was not incorporated in this forecast cycle.  Otherwise, there is
generally above average forecast confidence through Saturday on
the overall synoptic scale set-up.  The upcoming heat wave for
much of the Intermountain West and interior portions of the West
Coast states is also on track to make weather headlines, with the
13Z NBM appearing reasonable as a starting point in the forecast
process.  Numerous record high temperatures will likely be
established, and potentially some monthly June records could be
within reach, particularly across portions of Washington and
Oregon where afternoon highs could reach or exceed 110 degrees for
some lower elevation interior locations!  The previous discussion
is appended below. /Hamrick


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean
and 12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS mean Friday into Saturday in a
pattern with above average continuity and predictability.

The models exhibit considerable spread as well as run-to-run
variability over the weekend with and downstream from a Rex
blocking pattern on the West Coast. The ensemble means remain
compatible through early next week and were used in composite with
similarly consistent guidance from WPC continuity and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This composite develops and maintains
north-central U.S. upper troughing a bit on the amplified side of
the full envelope of guidance, seemingly consistent with upstream
blocking. Newer 00 UTC guidance overall continues these general
trends.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest by the weekend and the heat wave will expand for much of
the West into next week. Temperatures will climb to 15-25+ degrees
above normal from Washington/Oregon to the Northern Rockies, and
more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and west of the
Rockies. Records are likely from the Pacific Northwest to the
north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies, with temperatures
peaking over 100F to near 110F forecast for interior sections of
the West. Little to no rainfall is expected to ease this excessive
heat.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy, fortified and slow moving cold front to
stretch from the south-central to northeastern U.S. this weekend
and early next week, inviting deep moisture return and pooling.
Well organized showers and storms will significantly increase
rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the Southern Plains northeastward
across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the
Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely
across some of these areas.

Valid 12Z Fri Jun 25 2021 - 12Z Tue Jun 29 2021

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build record temperatures across the
Northwest/West...
...Elongated Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Plains to
Great Lakes...

19Z Update:  There has been a general westward shift in the heavy
rainfall axis from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region
with the 12Z guidance compared to the 00Z guidance.  This is in
response to a stronger western Atlantic upper ridge that will slow
the progress of the cold front and the shortwave impulses along
it.  The 12Z CMC was well to the east of the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means regarding the placement of both the
central U.S. upper trough and also with the Atlantic ridge, so it
was not incorporated in this forecast cycle.  Otherwise, there is
generally above average forecast confidence through Saturday on
the overall synoptic scale set-up.  The upcoming heat wave for
much of the Intermountain West and interior portions of the West
Coast states is also on track to make weather headlines, with the
13Z NBM appearing reasonable as a starting point in the forecast
process.  Numerous record high temperatures will likely be
established, and potentially some monthly June records could be
within reach, particularly across portions of Washington and
Oregon where afternoon highs could reach or exceed 110 degrees for
some lower elevation interior locations!  The previous discussion
is appended below. /Hamrick


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean
and 12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS mean Friday into Saturday in a
pattern with above average continuity and predictability.

The models exhibit considerable spread as well as run-to-run
variability over the weekend with and downstream from a Rex
blocking pattern on the West Coast. The ensemble means remain
compatible through early next week and were used in composite with
similarly consistent guidance from WPC continuity and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This composite develops and maintains
north-central U.S. upper troughing a bit on the amplified side of
the full envelope of guidance, seemingly consistent with upstream
blocking. Newer 00 UTC guidance overall continues these general
trends.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue June 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 28 - JUL 02, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast an amplified circulation
pattern with a trough over the North Pacific, centered over the Aleutians, and
a ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the eastern North Pacific
and western North America. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the
east-central CONUS, and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the Northeast.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored over much of western and
south-central Mainland Alaska, due to the predicted trough over the Aleutians
and associated potential storm system development and increased cloud cover.
Predicted southwesterly flow favors above normal temperatures for northeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. A predicted trough over the east-central
CONUS and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies favor enhanced probabilities of
below normal temperatures for eastern areas of the Southwest, the Central and
Southern Plains, the Central and Lower Mississippi Valley, and the Southeast.
Above normal temperatures are likely over the western CONUS, the Northern
Plains, and the Northeast, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies and
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Aleutians and anomalous southerly flow enhance
probabilities of above normal precipitation over the eastern Aleutians as well
as western and northern Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored
for eastern interior areas of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under
a
predicted ridge. A predicted ridge and anomalous northerly flow increase
probabilities of below normal precipitation from the Pacific Northwest, across
the Central and Northern Plains states into the Upper Mississippi Valley and
western Great Lakes region.  A predicted trough over the east-central CONUS
and
anomalous southerly surface flow around high pressure over the Atlantic favor
above normal precipitation from the Gulf Coast states across the Southeast
region and Eastern Seaboard, excluding the Florida Peninsula and Southeast
Atlantic coast, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. An
enhanced southwestern monsoon and associated above normal precipitation are
favored for much of the Southwest, supported by dynamical model forecasts and
the ERF consolidation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5,
due to good agreement among the model circulation, temperature, and
precipitation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 30 - JUL 06, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but somewhat deamplify, as ensemble spread and uncertainty
increase.
In particular the trough over the Aleutians deamplifies significantly during
the week 2 period, relative to the 6-10 day period.

Below normal temperatures are favored for southwestern Mainland Alaska,
associated with a mean trough over the Aleutians and potential development of
storm systems leading to increased cloud cover, while above normal
temperatures
are favored for parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, under
anomalous southerly flow. Above normal temperatures are likely over the West,
extending eastward across the Central and Northern Plains, and much of the
Great Lakes and Northeast regions, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies.
Below normal temperatures are favored over most of the remainder of the CONUS,
from eastern areas of the Southwest monsoon region across the Southern Plains
and Central and Lower Mississippi Valley into the Southeast region, under the
predicted trough and near zero 500-hPa height anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal precipitation are enhanced over southwestern
Mainland Alaska due to predicted troughing over the Aleutians. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased for the southern Alaska Panhandle
and
most of the northwestern CONUS and Northern and Central Plains, associated
with
the predicted ridge over the Gulf of Alaska and western CONUS. Near to above
normal precipitation is favored across the western and central Gulf Coast
region and much of the eastern CONUS, consistent with the ERF consolidation
tool and troughing over the east-central CONUS. An active monsoon and
associated above normal precipitation are favored in week 2 across most of the
Southwest, supported by dynamical model forecasts and the ERF consolidation
tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high (low) pressure is predicted to dominate the western
(eastern) half of the lower 48. This pattern is anticipated to start out as
amplified at the beginning of the period, deamplifying by the middle of
week-2.
Anomalous mid-level high pressure across the West is expected to support
increased risk of excessive heat across many parts of the region during the
period. Excessive heat is anticipated for parts of the West during week-1 and
expand to the North-Central contiguous U.S. by week-2. Excessive heat impacts
will likely be exacerbated by the ongoing severe to exceptional drought
conditions across these areas. Downstream, mid-level low pressure favors more
seasonable weather across the eastern contiguous U.S., with frontal activity
possibly enhancing precipitation early in the period. Mid-level low pressure
forecast over the North-Central Pacific favors increased precipitation chances
across western Alaska.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat across parts of the Great Basin and Northern
Rockies, Wed-Thu, Jun 30-Jul 1.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of California, interior Pacific
Northwest, the Great Basin, Northern and Central Rockies, and Northern Plains,
Wed-Fri, Jun 30-Jul 2.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the western CONUS, excluding the
Southern Plains and Southern Rockies, Wed-Tue, Jun 30-Jul 6.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, Wed-Fri, Jun 30-Jul 2.

Flooding possible for portions of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ohio
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 25 - TUESDAY JUNE 29:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!t0veUc7-Lgv_dDaBU2hwSpQlIfr7JCbcR0mHtvQN47UJRgrCfoToiCgw85y8EE0ETA6d3m2m$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 30 - TUESDAY JULY 06: Anomalous ridging is forecast to
amplify over the western CONUS towards the end of week-1, with 500-hPa
geopotential heights of 594-597 dam indicated over parts of the northwestern
CONUS in the latest deterministic runs of the ECMWF and GFS. By the start of
week-2, the mid-level heights are expected to decrease slightly, but the
ridging is forecast to become more expansive, with positive mid-level height
anomalies favored to build across the north-central CONUS. Similar to
yesterday's runs, the 0z ECMWF ensemble is more progressive in expanding the
ridge across the Great Plains compared to the 0z GEFS. This evolution is also
seen in the reforecast tools, where the ECMWF tool depicts at least a 60%
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile from the Great
Basin through portions of the Northern Plains early in week-2. The GEFS
reforecast tool, however, confines these higher probabilities to the Great
Basin and Northern Rockies, corresponding with the placement of a high risk
(>60% chance) for excessive heat for 6/30 and 7/1. The National Blend of
Models
(NBM) indicates the potential for daily record high temperatures across the
highlighted high risk area, with lower-elevation high temperatures likely
exceeding 100 deg F, and possibly reaching 105 deg F. The ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast tools also indicate the possibility of maximum temperatures
exceeding triple digits. With the forecast expansion of the ridge across the
North Central states, a moderate risk (>40% chance) of excessive heat is
highlighted from interior California and Great Basin to the Northern Plains
from June 30 to July 2. A broad slight risk (>20% chance) for excessive heat
is
maintained across many parts of the western CONUS, and through parts of the
Northern and Central Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley for the entire week-2
period, excluding the Southern Plains. The forecast excessive heat and
generally dry conditions will exacerbate the ongoing drought over the western
and North-Central CONUS, where many areas are classified as being in severe to
exceptional drought as of June 15. The National Interagency Fire Center
indicates moderate risk for wildfires across many parts of the West at the end
of week-1, with parts of the Southwest having potential for lightning
triggers.
Anticipated hot and dry conditions during week-2 would likely prolong the
increased risk for wildfire potential across these areas.



Downstream of the ridging, troughing is generally predicted across the
East-Central CONUS, favoring maximum temperatures closer to normal across many
areas of the East, or even on the cooler side. Weak anomalous positive
mid-level heights are predicted to linger at the beginning of the period from
the end of week-1, resulting in increased potential for anomalously warm
temperatures across the Northeast. The ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at
least
a 20% chance of heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile (GEFS
reforecast tool signal for heat is weaker). However, the ECMWF and GEFS
reforecast tools do not indicate probabilities exceeding 20% for temperatures
exceeding 90 deg F, precluding an excessive heat risk from being included for
this region for week-2. The 0Z deterministic GFS (and some runs prior to it)
had indicated possible tropical cyclone activity in the Gulf of Mexico, which
could further enhance rainfall in the Gulf Coast area. However, later runs
(today's 6Z and 12Z), did not show an organized disturbance. Regardless of the
potential formation of a tropical cyclone in the Gulf of Mexico, possible
frontal activity ahead of the trough axis combined with southerly moist flow
from the Gulf of Mexico due to sub-tropical surface high pressure across the
Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico favors wet weather for parts of the East. A slight
risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, and Southeast, June 30 to July 2 where
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least 20% chance of 3-day
rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch.



Antecedent rainfall from Tropical Storm Claudette in addition to elevated soil
moisture and expected heavy rainfall during week-2 is likely to prolong the
threat of river flooding across the Lower Mississippi Valley into the period.
River flooding is also ongoing along the White River in Indiana, where
additional rainfall is forecast during week-1 and both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools indicate increased potential for heavy rainfall during
week-2.
As a result, the possible flood hazard across southern Indiana and adjacent
areas is maintained for week-2.



Multiple week-2 model tools indicate possible enhancement of the southwest
monsoon during the period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, however,
limits
the potential for 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and half
an inch to the southernmost portions of the Four Corners region, precluding a
related heavy precipitation hazard from being included on today's outlook.



Mid-level low pressure is forecast to dominate the central North Pacific
including most of mainland Alaska during the period. With periods of surface
low pressure also forecast across the Bering Sea and mainland Alaska, enhanced
precipitation and increased wind speeds are likely across southwestern and
South-Central mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. However, the reforecast tools
remain unsupportive of precipitation amounts and sustained wind speeds
reaching
pre-determined hazard thresholds. The 0z ECMWF, 0z GEFS, and 0Z Canadian
ensemble means show the troughing over the Bering Sea weakening toward the end
of the period favoring a trend toward more tranquil weather.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0259 PM CDT Tue Jun 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

There has been a notable surge of mid-level moisture farther north
in guidance over the past day of model runs. Current water vapor
imagery shows a plume of moisture moving northward out of western
Mexico. This does suggest that models are picking up a real trend.
That being said, coverage of thunderstorms across a broad swath of
the West will be greater than anticipated. As such, the dry
thunderstorm area has been adjusted. On the front end of this
moisture surge, storm motions are expected to be faster and PWAT
slightly lower than on subsequent days in the Great Basin. A
categorical upgrade to scattered dry thunderstorms was considered,
though enough uncertainty exists that confidence remains too low.
Given that the moisture is a tropical system remnant, a greater
amount of mid/high clouds are expected, which is also borne out in
current visible satellite. The impact this would have on surface
heating and storm initiation are enough to defer an upgrade to next
outlook. However, greater storm coverage is still expected in parts
of southern/central Utah.

..Wendt.. 06/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Tue Jun 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level flow pattern over the CONUS will transition to more
zonal flow, as mid-level heights increase across the southern third
of the country. The upper low along the West Coast will stall,
keeping southwesterly flow aloft above much of the West. Deep
moisture will spread northward supporting thunderstorms across the
southern Rockies and Great Basin.

...Great Basin...
Southerly flow along the eastern periphery of the stalled upper low
will transport Gulf of California moisture northward across the Four
Corners and Southern Rockies. Model soundings show weak buoyancy
(MUCAPE 250-500 J/kg) developing across a broad swath of the
Southwest, from southern New Mexico northward, into southern Nevada.
CAM guidance suggests isolated storms will develop first along the
higher terrain before becoming more widespread with time. Despite
higher than average PWAT values around 1 inch, fast storm speeds and
relatively dry low-level profiles will favor high-based storms.
Fuels over much of the region are exceptionally dry, suggesting high
susceptibility to lightning ignitions. Isolated dry lightning
strikes appear likely, and isolated dry thunder probabilities will
be continued.

...Southern Wyoming...
Lee troughing across the High Plains will increase west-east
pressure gradients across the central Rockies and southern Wyoming
through Day2/Wednesday. Westerly downslope winds of 15-20 mph will
likely develop coincident with dry surface conditions during peak
heating. Surface RH of 15-20%, and sufficiently dry fuels will
support elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions through
the afternoon.

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build record temperatures across the
Northwest/West...
...Elongated Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Plains to
Great Lakes...

19Z Update:  There has been a general westward shift in the heavy
rainfall axis from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region
with the 12Z guidance compared to the 00Z guidance.  This is in
response to a stronger western Atlantic upper ridge that will slow
the progress of the cold front and the shortwave impulses along
it.  The 12Z CMC was well to the east of the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means regarding the placement of both the
central U.S. upper trough and also with the Atlantic ridge, so it
was not incorporated in this forecast cycle.  Otherwise, there is
generally above average forecast confidence through Saturday on
the overall synoptic scale set-up.  The upcoming heat wave for
much of the Intermountain West and interior portions of the West
Coast states is also on track to make weather headlines, with the
13Z NBM appearing reasonable as a starting point in the forecast
process.  Numerous record high temperatures will likely be
established, and potentially some monthly June records could be
within reach, particularly across portions of Washington and
Oregon where afternoon highs could reach or exceed 110 degrees for
some lower elevation interior locations!  The previous discussion
is appended below. /Hamrick


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean
and 12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF/ECENS mean Friday into Saturday in a
pattern with above average continuity and predictability.

The models exhibit considerable spread as well as run-to-run
variability over the weekend with and downstream from a Rex
blocking pattern on the West Coast. The ensemble means remain
compatible through early next week and were used in composite with
similarly consistent guidance from WPC continuity and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models. This composite develops and maintains
north-central U.S. upper troughing a bit on the amplified side of
the full envelope of guidance, seemingly consistent with upstream
blocking. Newer 00 UTC guidance overall continues these general
trends.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest by the weekend and the heat wave will expand for much of
the West into next week. Temperatures will climb to 15-25+ degrees
above normal from Washington/Oregon to the Northern Rockies, and
more generally 5-15 degrees above normal along and west of the
Rockies. Records are likely from the Pacific Northwest to the
north/central Great Basin and northern Rockies, with temperatures
peaking over 100F to near 110F forecast for interior sections of
the West. Little to no rainfall is expected to ease this excessive
heat.

Downstream, robust upper trough digging from south-central Canada
will solidify a wavy, fortified and slow moving cold front to
stretch from the south-central to northeastern U.S. this weekend
and early next week, inviting deep moisture return and pooling.
Well organized showers and storms will significantly increase
rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the front with an
elongated and focused zone from the Southern Plains northeastward
across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and Appalachians to the
Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding are likely
across some of these areas.

...A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall extending from the southern
Mid-Atlantic to the Central Gulf Coast will remain in effect
overnight...

...Severe thunderstorms will be possible this over the Central
Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley through Thursday...

...A Critical Risk of fire weather conditions has been issued for
portions of the Central Great Basin...

A long, slow moving frontal boundary traversing the coastline from
the Northeast to Gulf Coast and into the Southern Plains will be
the focal point for heavy rainfall for much of the short-range
period. High moisture values ahead of the front mixing with a
destabilized atmosphere will likely result in the development of
showers and thunderstorms with high rain rates that could produce
isolated to scattered flash flooding. At present, a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall has been issued by the Weather Prediction
Center from the Mid-Atlantic to the central Gulf Coast and will
remain in effect through Wednesday morning. While the northern
half of the frontal boundary is forecast to propagate offshore by
Wednesday morning, the southern portion over the Southeast and
Gulf Coast is expected to stall and linger. With the front sitting
in place convection will continue to focus over these regions,
extending the risk of isolated flash flooding for some areas
through Thursday morning.

Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms are forecast to develop along
a weak quasi-stationary front extending from the Central Plains to
the Middle Mississippi Valley. Due to the potential for some of
these storms to become severe and capable of producing large hail
and gusty winds, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms for portions of Iowa and eastern
Nebraska through Wednesday morning. Isolated flash flooding
associated with these storms will also be a concern.

By Wednesday evening, a cold front diving south through central
Canada will reach the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest,
triggering showers and thunderstorms throughout the regions.
Similarly to the previous day, damaging winds and large hail could
be produced by these thunderstorms if they were to become severe.
As such, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms for much of Nebraska, with Marginal Risks
issued for portions of the Central Plains and Upper Midwest. Heavy
rainfall associated with these storms will also create a risk for
scattered flash flooding.

Out West warm, dry, and windy surface conditions in the Central
Great Basin and Southwest will create favorable conditions for
fire weather, with a Critical Risk area encompassing much of
central/southern Utah, eastern Nevada, and northwestern Arizona.
Additionally, dry thunderstorms with isolated lightning strikes
will be possible over the Northern Great Basin where dry fuels are
present, creating another risk area for fire weather. With these
conditions in place, Red Flag Warnings are currently in effect for
portions of the Southwest, Great Basin, and Central Rockies. To
the south, a plume of moisture surging into the Southwest and
Southern California will interact with upper-level energy to
trigger showers and thunderstorms over the regions Wednesday
morning before spreading into parts of the Great Basin and the
Central/Southern Rockies overnight.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
138 AM EDT Wed Jun 23 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Jun 26 2021 - 12Z Wed Jun 30 2021

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build Daily to Monthly Record
Temperatures across the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF, 12 UTC NAEFS/ECENS means, the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models and WPC continuity in an overall pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Forecast spread and
run-to-run variability has improved compared to the last few days
and a composite seems to mitigate much of the lingering and less
predictable small-mid scale variances. Newer 00 UTC guidance so
far remains in line with the WPC composite. However, recent
Canadian runs are displaced east of most guidance with placement
of the central U.S. trough and western Atlantic ridge, so they
remain discounted.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little to no rainfall is
expected to ease this excessive heat this forecast period, growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

...Dangerous Heat Wave to build Daily to Monthly Record
Temperatures across the Northwest/West...
...Heavy Rain Threat to stretch from Southern Rockies/Plains to
Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio Valley and the Northeast...

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite of best clustered solutions of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean,
12 UTC UKMET/ECMWF, 12 UTC NAEFS/ECENS means, the 01 UTC National
Blend of Models and WPC continuity in an overall pattern with
above average continuity and predictability. Forecast spread and
run-to-run variability has improved compared to the last few days
and a composite seems to mitigate much of the lingering and less
predictable small-mid scale variances. Newer 00 UTC guidance so
far remains in line with the WPC composite. However, recent
Canadian runs are displaced east of most guidance with placement
of the central U.S. trough and western Atlantic ridge, so they
remain discounted.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A highly anomalous upper ridge will build inland over the
Northwest this weekend and the heat wave will expand over the West
into next week. Temperatures will soar to 20-30 degrees above
normal from Washington/Oregon to the northern Great Basin/Rockies.
Numerous daily to some monthly records are likely from the Pacific
Northwest and interior California to the north/central Great Basin
and Northern Rockies, with temperatures peaking over 100F to 110+F
for interior sections of the West. Little to no rainfall is
expected to ease this excessive heat this forecast period, growing
drought and fire threats.

Downstream, a robust upper trough will dig and settle into the
north-central U.S. to solidify and reinforce a wavy and slow
moving front to stretch from the south-central to northeastern
U.S. this period. This will invite deep moisture return and
pooling. Well organized showers and storms will significantly
increase rainfall and runoff potential along and ahead of the
front with an elongated and focused zone from the Southern
Rockies/Plains northeastward across the Midwest/Mid-South, Ohio
Valley and the Northeast. Episodes of cell training and flooding
are likely across some of these areas with overall progression
slowed as broadly sandwiched between the heat wave out West and a
strong western Atlantic ridge to the east. Also, there is also
some signal for tropical moisture to feed into southern Florida to
fuel convection early-mid next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper low along the West Coast will move little as mid-level
ridging lingers over the Rockies and High Plains. Mid-level
moisture, within deep southerly flow ahead of the low, will move
northward across the Four Corners and Great Basin. Dry thunderstorm
activity is expected across much of the Southwest, while elevated
fire weather conditions will develop across Wyoming.

...Great Basin and Southwest Dry Thunder...
Ahead of the stalled upper low, moisture will spread north into
portions of the Great Basin and Southwest. Forcing for ascent will
gradually increase through the morning, as a shortwave trough along
the eastern edge of the upper low moves into southern Arizona.
Thunderstorm activity will increase through the day, with initiation
expected first along the crests of the higher terrain, before
gradually expanding through much of the Four Corners and Great
Basin. Storm coverage should remain isolated, though local coverage
across Arizona and southern Utah may become scattered, given greater
upper-air support with the approaching shortwave trough.

Model soundings show deep and well-mixed boundary layers beneath the
plume of mid-level moisture supporting isolated dry lightning
strikes across much of Arizona, western Colorado, Nevada, and Utah.
Fuels in the region remain highly susceptible to lightning
ignitions, necessitating dry thunder probabilities. Uncertainty
increases with northward extent across portions of Oregon and Idaho.
Here, greater PWAT values and scattered storm coverage may reduce
ignition efficiency. However, the threat for lightning in volatile
fuels suggests enough concern exists for dry thunder probabilities.

...Southern Wyoming...
Lee troughing will strengthen through the day across the central
High Plains, as flow aloft increases over the Rockies. Surface
pressure gradients will drive westerly winds down the leeward slopes
through southern and central Wyoming. Adiabatic warming and drying
will allow relative humidity values to drop below 20% during the
afternoon. The combination of gusty winds near 15-20 mph and low RH
will support elevated to near critical fire weather conditions.

...Lee of the Cascades...
On the backside of a departing mid-level jet, westerly flow will
develop along the southern Cascades. Enhancement of the flow along
the lee slopes will increase surface winds to around 15-20 mph.
These gusty winds will overlap with a warm and dry airmass
containing surface RH below 30%. Locally elevated conditions may
occur for a few hours where fuels are fully cured.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CDT Wed Jun 23 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper low along the West Coast will become cutoff, as the
mid-level flow across the central and eastern CONUS becomes more
zonal. The slow-moving low will advect deep moisture into much of
the western CONUS, potentially supporting widespread thunderstorms
and precipitation. Lightning over dry fuels will become a concern
given the available moisture, but uncertainty on storm coverage
remains high.

...Dry Thunder...
With plentiful mid-level moisture in place ahead of the upper low,
thunderstorms are again expected across much of the Western US
day2/Thursday. Cloud debris and showers from Day1/Wednesday
convection will likely impact destabilization across portions of the
Great Basin early in the day. CAMs remain uncertain on the degree to
which diurnal heating will be reduced, offering two outcomes. Should
cloud cover be limited, scattered to numerous storms appear possible
with an increased risk for lightning over dry fuels. If widespread
cloud cover and showers persist, the potential for destabilization
and subsequent lightning may be seriously degraded. An additional
complicating factor will be the increasing PWAT values above 0.75
inches favoring wetter storms. With the uncertainty in mind, a broad
area of isolated dry thunder probabilities will be maintained with
the understanding that mesoscale details remain difficult to see for
now. Refinement in the area will be necessary, but the potential
threat for lightning over dry fuels across much of the West warrants
the dry thunder delineation.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Plains through Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley Thursday through
Friday morning...

...Fire weather conditions forecast across the Great Basin...

A front that extends from the Southeast westward to the
Southern/Central Plains will be quasi-stationary through Friday.
Ample moisture pooling along the boundary will help produce
showers and thunderstorms along and near the front through Friday
over the Southeast and the Gulf Coast States. A second front
moving southward out of South-Central Canada will move toward the
Great lakes and stall overnight Thursday.  The boundary will aid
in producing showers and thunderstorms over the Upper Midwest
through Friday.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Central Plains through Thursday
morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms are
frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, and hail.

The severe thunderstorm threat increases from Thursday into
Friday. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms
over parts of the Central Plains and the Middle Mississippi Valley
through Friday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  The excessive rainfall threat
increases on Thursday, too.  With the forecast of heavy rain, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley from
Thursday into Friday morning.  The associated heavy rain will
create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas,
roads, and small streams the most vulnerable through Wednesday
morning.

Meanwhile, a plume of moisture surges into the Southwest and
Southern California on Wednesday and waning by Thursday evening.
Impulses of upper-level energy moving around an upper-level high
over the U. S. and Mexican border will trigger showers and
thunderstorms over parts of Southern California and the Southwest
on Wednesday morning.  The showers and thunderstorms will expand
into parts of the Great Basin and the Central/Southern Rockies
through Thursday morning. Additional upper-level energy will come
over the top of the upper-level ridge producing showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Northern High Plains into the
Great Basin and Central Rockies.  The showers and thunderstorms
will expand into the Northern/Central Plains on Friday.

Elsewhere, warm, dry, and windy surface conditions in the Central
Great Basin and Southwest will create favorable conditions for
fire weather, with a Critical Risk area encompassing much of
southern Wyoming. Additionally, dry thunderstorms with isolated
lightning strikes will be possible over the Northern Great Basin,
where dry fuels are present, creating another risk area for fire
weather. Red Flag Warnings are currently in effect for portions of
the Southwest, Great Basin, and Pacific Northwest with these
conditions in place.

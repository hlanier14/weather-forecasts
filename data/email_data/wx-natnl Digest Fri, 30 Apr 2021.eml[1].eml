Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1147 AM CDT Thu Apr 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

Locally elevated conditions remain possible in parts of northeast
New Mexico into the western combined panhandles. The stronger
pressure gradient and mid-level winds should shift southward today
making duration somewhat questionable. Sustained, elevated
meteorological conditions appear more likely in east-central New
Mexico, though more rainfall has fallen there in the past 24 hours.

Temperatures warming into the 60s to 70s F behind a weak cold front
in parts of North Dakota into eastern Montana could lead to pockets
of elevated conditions this afternoon. A better overlap of
low/mid-level winds exists in eastern North Dakota, increasing the
likelihood of a couple hours of elevated conditions.

..Wendt.. 04/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0105 AM CDT Thu Apr 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
A cold front currently draped over the Plains into northern Mexico
will continue to slowly push south and east through the day. In its
wake, dry and breezy northwesterly flow will overspread most of the
Plains. This may introduce a few localized fire weather concerns,
but recent rainfall will mitigate most concerns over the Southwest
and the central and southern Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Recent radar precipitation estimates suggest that portions of the
western OK/TX Panhandles and far northeast NM received little
rainfall over the past 24 hours. Only light and isolated rain is
expected through mid-day for this region, so antecedent dry fuels
may not be overly influenced by recent precipitation. North to
northeasterly winds are forecast to increase by late afternoon to
15-20 mph and may see occasional gusts upwards of 30-35 mph as
mid-level flow strengthens in response to an increasing pressure
gradient. Clearing skies will help drive boundary-layer mixing and
RH reductions into the 20-25% range. As such, elevated fire weather
conditions are expected where fuels remain dry (though elevated
wind/RH combinations may occur where fuels have received wetting
rains). Further refinements are possible as additional precipitation
reports come in through mid-morning and guidance comes into better
agreement regarding the spatial extent of the threat.

...Central Plains...
Breezy northwesterly winds at 15-20 mph are expected to overspread
the central Plains this afternoon. Wind gusts up to 25-30 mph are
possible, and mostly clear skies will help drive diurnal heating as
well as RH reductions down to 30% for most locations. A few more
aggressive solutions suggest RH values may fall to around 25% across
southeast NE and northeast KS where fuels have been drying after
several days of limited rainfall. This could lead to a few hours of
elevated fire weather conditions, though confidence in the duration
and coverage of the threat remains too low to introduce a risk area.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level high pressure is predicted to dominate the eastern
two-thirds of the lower 48 and eastern and central Alaska, with mid-level l=
ow
pressure favored elsewhere during week-2. A series of surface lows are
anticipated to form over the central and western contiguous U.S. The fairly
low
amplitude of the pattern combined with significant model uncertainty regard=
ing
the timing and strength of surface low pressure systems makes it difficult =
to
forecast specific hazards. However, parts of the Southwest and Gulf Coast a=
re
expected to be especially warm and there is increased potential for heavy
rainfall throughout parts of the eastern U.S. associated with convection.

HAZARDS

No hazards are depicted in today's outlook as probabilities are not
anticipated
to reach pre-defined criteria during the forecast period at this time.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 02 - THURSDAY MAY 06:

FOR FRIDAY MAY 07 - THURSDAY MAY 13: The majority of week-2 is anticipated =
to
be dominated by mid-level ridging across the eastern two-thirds of the CONU=
S,
with mid-level troughing across the western third. Above normal temperature=
s
are favored across the southern half of the CONUS, excluding western
California. Surface low development over the Plains toward the middle of th=
e
period could support enhanced moist southerly flow ahead of it, into parts =
of
South-Central and southeastern CONUS. This moisture combined with above nor=
mal
temperatures support increased chances for excessive heat across parts of t=
he
Southern Plains, Gulf Coast, and Florida. Some of the CPC heat tools indica=
te
at least a 30% chance of heat index values exceeding the 95th percentile an=
d
105 DegF across parts of Texas and Florida from the middle to end of week-2=
.
However, due to significant differences among the heat index tools and
reforecast tools showing maximum air temperatures remaining below hazardous
thresholds, a heat hazard is not posted at this time.



The 0Z ECMWF, GEFS, Canadian ensemble means favors the formation of surface
low
pressure centered somewhere over the Four Corners and western Texas at the
beginning of week-2. This low could support enhanced wind speeds across the
southwestern quadrant of the CONUS and the Lee of the Rockies. Both the ECM=
WF
and GEFS reforecast tools indicate this area of the country having at least=
 a
30% chance of exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph, with the ECMWF
reforecast tool having a stronger signal for a high wind potential compared=
 to
the GEFS. Significant model differences regarding the high wind risk potent=
ial
in addition to the expectation that the risk may be relatively localized,
precludes an associated hazard from being posted at this time. However,
localized enhanced wind speeds combined with above normal temperatures  wou=
ld
favor an increased the potential for wildfires in the Southwest eastward in=
to
parts of Texas, where severe drought prevails. Interested parties are advis=
ed
to follow their local NWS forecasts carefully.



The mid-level trough across the West is expected to progress slowly eastwar=
d,
which would support the formation of a series of surface lows and associate=
d
fronts across the central CONUS forming during the middle to end of the
period.
There continues to be significant model discrepancies regarding the timing =
and
amplitude of this anomalous troughing and associated surface features. The =
06Z
GEFS favors a higher amplitude trough over the eastern CONUS than the 00Z
ECMWF
during the middle of week-2. Either way, there are likely to be localized
pockets of heavy rainfall along the front that accompanies the shortwave.
However, there isn't enough confidence of rainfall exceeding 1 inch per 24
hour
period to warrant an associated hazard on the map at this time.



Mid-level height anomalies are anticipated to be fairly weak across Alaska
during week-2. A series of surface lows are anticipated to form over the Gu=
lf
of Alaska and Bering Sea, but are not anticipated to support any widespread
hazards at this time.

...Heavy rainfall possible from eastern Texas to the lower
Mississippi Valley on Sunday and then across the Deep South
Tuesday to Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue the theme of broad upper-level
troughing sliding across the northern tier states as the southern
stream directs a generally southwesterly flow across the
mid-section of the country toward the Northeast.  Models again
exhibits a trend for a faster/more progressive northern stream
flow, which helps sharpening a slow-moving front that extends from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley to New England.  In addition, models
continue to struggle with predicting the multiple wave
interactions along the northern stream, lending to the greatest
amount of forecast uncertainty across the northern tier states
into the Northeast for the longer range period.

Across the western Gulf Coast states, an upper-level trough/low
will lift northeastward across the southern Plains late this
weekend with a threat of heavy rain mainly from the lower
Mississippi Valley westward the eastern Texas.  Meanwhile, models
agree well regarding the next upper-level trough forecast to exit
the central Rockies early next week with a period of enhanced
rainfall for the High Plains with some significant wet snow
possible along the Front Range of Colorado.  This wave will likely
play a key role in setting up a possible heavy rain event across
the Deep South ahead of a cold front by Tuesday and into
Wednesday.  Remaining moisture will likely move into the East
Coast mid-week before a general drying trend sets in as the upper
trough is forecast to edge toward the coast.  Meanwhile, moisture
from the next Pacific cyclone is forecast to reach the Pacific
Northwest toward the latter part of next week.

The WPC product suite was derived from a composite blend of the 00
UTC ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS and some contribution from the 00Z
Canadian/CMC mean, with increasing usage of the ensemble means
toward Day 7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf of Mexico moisture and instability ahead of the initial
trough/closed low over the Southern Plains on Sunday will fuel
numerous showers and thunderstorms across parts of the central
Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley Sunday-Monday.
Confidence is increasing in heavy rainfall potential in this
region, some of which has already seen above normal precipitation
over the past few weeks. This would likely increase the flooding
threat as well. The system is expected to shear northeastward into
early/mid next week with a swath of enhanced rainfall possible
farther northern into the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

The next system into the Western U.S. should support mountain
snows across the Colorado Rockies and organized rain into the
central High Plains Sunday-Monday. As the troughing amplifies
across the Plains on Tuesday, moderate to heavy rainfall should
develop along and ahead of a cold front. Again, the threat seems
to be centered over much of the same region as the previous system
-- central Gulf Coast/Tennessee Valley/lower Ohio Valley Tuesday
into Wednesday.

The Eastern U.S. should stay above normal in terms of temperatures
much of the period ahead and south of a wavy frontal boundary. The
Western U.S. system will spread below to much below normal
temperatures from the Rockies into the Plains Monday and Tuesday,
moderating as the system moves eastward. Meanwhile, much of the
Western Coast to Desert Southwest will see a warming trend
Monday-Thursday as upper level ridging builds aloft.

...A Marginal risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect from parts
of the northern Mid-Atlantic to the Lower Mississippi
Valley/eastern Texas through Friday morning...

...There is a Slight risk of excessive rainfall over the ArkLaTex
region through Friday morning.

...There is a chance for record-breaking high minimum temperatures
over the East and below-average temperatures over the Southern
Rockies/Southern High Plains...

A frontal boundary spanning from southern New England, across the
Ohio and Mid-Mississippi Valleys and southwest to eastern
Oklahoma/Texas will continue on with its slow eastward progression
through the weekend. Scattered to widespread thunderstorms will
develop along and ahead of this boundary over the next few days.
Some of these storms will be quite strong, possibly severe, and
may usher in hail, damaging winds and possibly an isolated
tornado. The Storm Prediction Center has a Marginal Risk for
severe storms in effect from eastern Texas to western Connecticut
through Friday morning. These storms will also produce moderate to
heavy downpours across portions of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley and may lead to scattered areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the
most vulnerable. WPC has a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall in
effect from northeast Texas to extreme southwest Tennessee.

Rain will develop over the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic on Friday
morning, extending into parts of the Ohio Valley during the
afternoon on Friday. The rain will end over the Mid-Atlantic/Ohio
Valley by Friday evening, while wet snow will develop  over parts
of Upstate New York Friday night. The rain will taper off over New
England by Saturday morning as light snow moves into the higher
elevations of Northern New England. For areas south of this
sprawling frontal boundary, warmer temperatures are expected.
Several locations could tie or break high minimum temperature
records for Thursday morning- especially across the Ohio Valley
and Mid-Atlantic regions.

Meanwhile, an upper-level low over the Southern Rockies will move
into Northern Mexico on Thursday and will usher in cooler air to
the region. This will allow daily temperatures to be about 10 to
20 degrees below seasonal average for the Southern Rockies and the
adjacent High Plains. Elsewhere, a front moving onshore over the
Pacific Northwest on Friday afternoon will produce light rain over
parts of the Northwest overnight Friday.

0202 PM CDT Thu Apr 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST MONTANA AND FAR WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...

...Northern Plains...
The forecast for Montana into North Dakota remains on track. In
eastern North Dakota, ahead of the surface trough, southerly winds
of 15-20 mph are possible. There is a fair amount of variability in
forecast RH, however. Given the amount of cloud cover evident in
forecast soundings, more than local and/or brief elevated conditions
are not certain.

...Piedmont into the Coastal Plain...
The general trend in guidance has been for less precipitation east
of the Blue Ridge into the Piedmont. EACC continues to report ERCs
near or above the 90th percentile in much of the region. Given a
continued signal for 15-20 mph winds (higher gusts) and RH of
20-30%, an elevated area has been added. Confidence in stronger
winds declines as you move south, similar to confidence in low RH to
the north.

..Wendt.. 04/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0210 AM CDT Thu Apr 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge over the West Coast is forecast to shift
eastward over the next 24 hours, and should be over the Rockies by
Friday morning. Most guidance indicates a mid-level perturbation
will propagate from southwest Canada into the northern Rockies
within the mean northwesterly flow. This feature will augment low
and mid-level pressure gradients and yield strong winds across much
of Montana and into the western Dakotas. Elsewhere, recent rainfall
will limit additional fire weather concerns. A regional fire weather
threat may evolve over the Carolinas, but this will be conditional
on rainfall over the next 24 hours.

...Northeast Montana...
Limited precipitation over the past two weeks has allowed 1-hour and
10-hour fuels to cure across much of northeast MT and into the
western Dakotas. These fuels will support a fire weather threat as
west/northwest winds increase to near 20 mph across the northern
High Plains. Although high cloud cover may limit diurnal heating to
some degree, downslope warming and drying will support sufficient
boundary-layer mixing to allow frequent 30-40 mph wind gusts.
Relative-humidity reductions into the teens are likely, and may fall
into the single digits across northeast MT. These conditions should
support a considerable fire weather threat, and critical conditions
may extent further west to the lee of the Rockies (though improving
fuel conditions with westward extent will limit the fire weather
potential).

...Carolinas...
Many locations across eastern NC and SC remain very dry with ERC
values beginning to climb above seasonal normals. A cold front is
forecast to push through the region late Thursday into early Friday,
which should allow for breezy and dry northwesterly winds by the
afternoon hours.  Relative humidity values are expected to fall near
30%, but may fall into the 20s where sufficient daytime heating and
mixing can occur. While elevated fire weather conditions are
possible, rain chances associated with the frontal passage may
mitigate fuel readiness. A risk area may need to be introduced in
future updates if little to no rainfall occurs and fuels remain dry
by Friday morning.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 29 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 05 - 09 2021

Dynamical model solutions are in only fair agreement regarding a transient
500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain during the outlook period.
Troughing is centered over the Aleutians in most model solutions. There is
some
uncertainty among ensemble members and between different model solutions on
the
extent to which troughing extends to the northwestern CONUS. Both the ECMWF
and
Canadian ensembles depict ridging in the central Pacific, which favors more
amplified troughing downstream, compared to the GEFS. Ridging is predicted
over
the Southwest by most model solutions, while the ECMWF ensemble mean places
the
center of the ridge further east than the GEFS ensemble mean. Troughing is
centered over the Great Lakes region, and more amplified in todays ECMWF
ensemble mean compared to yesterdays solution. The GEFS ensemble mean
forecasts a slightly deeper trough over the eastern CONUS than the ECMWF
ensemble mean, while the Canadian ensemble mean is similar to the ECMWF
ensemble mean, while predicting weaker anomalies over the CONUS. The ECMWF
ensemble mean was given the greatest weight in the 500-hPa manual blend, du=
e
to
good agreement with the 0Z ECMWF high resolution run, slightly greater rece=
nt
skill, and to maintain consistency with yesterdays forecast.

Positive height anomalies forecast over much of the western CONUS favors
increased probabilities for near to above normal temperatures across most o=
f
the western CONUS, outside of parts of the Pacific Northwest. This is
consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. Probabilities for belo=
w
normal temperatures are increased across parts of southern Mainland Alaska,
the
Alaska Panhandle, and the Pacific Northwest, under the influence of troughi=
ng.
Below normal temperatures are favored for much of the east-central CONUS,
related to the increasing amplitude of troughing over the region. Increased
chances of above normal temperatures are forecast across parts of the
Southeast, due to less influence from the troughing, and supported by the
reforecast tools.

Probabilities of below normal precipitation are elevated for much of the
western CONUS and Great Plains due to weak mid-level flow. Troughing along =
the
West Coast in the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble mean forecasts leads to a
forecast of enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation for parts =
of
the Pacific Northwest and near normal precipitation for the northern tier i=
n
the west. Troughing over the east leads to a more active downstream pattern=
,
favoring near to above normal precipitation across much of the eastern CONU=
S.
Enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are predicted from the
Great Lakes region into the Northeast, where the GEFS and ECMWF precipitati=
on
forecasts agree, and over parts of the eastern Gulf Coast, due to northward
surface moisture flow. Across Alaska, enhanced westerly flow resulting from
troughing over the Aleutian Islands favors increased chances for above norm=
al
precipitation across the southern Mainland and the Panhandle, as depicted i=
n
the consolidation forecast tool. Near normal precipitation chances are favo=
red
for the remainder of the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fa=
ir
agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by some disagreeme=
nt
among the temperature and precipitation tools, and a transient circulation
pattern across much of the forecast domain.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 07 - 13 2021

Weak, transient mid-level flow is predicted across North America throughout
the
week-2 period resulting in a somewhat uncertain forecast. The ECMWF and
Canadian ensembles depict weakly positive height anomalies across much of t=
he
southern CONUS, while the GEFS predicts greater negative height anomalies o=
ver
the northeastern CONUS and greater positive anomalies over the northwest.
Ridging in the Central Pacific in the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means, le=
ads
to more troughing over the west coast of the CONUS. The manual height blend
for
the 8-14 day period depicts near normal heights for much of the CONUS and
Alaska, with a slight tilt towards positive height anomalies over the south=
ern
CONUS, and some negative height anomalies over the Great Lakes and Northeas=
t
regions. Near to below normal mid-level heights are indicated over the
Aleutians, near the southwest coast of Mainland Alaska.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are predicted for mos=
t
of
the southern CONUS from Southern California eastward across the Central and
Southern Plains to the mid-Atlantic and Southeast Atlantic Coast. Troughing=
 is
predicted to shift eastward into the Pacific Northwest compared to the 6-10
day
period, resulting in enhanced probabilities for below normal temperatures f=
or
the region, and extending into the Northern Plains. Continued troughing ove=

the Central and Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes region, and the
Northeast. Continued enhanced troughing across southwestern Alaska favors
increased probabilities for near to below normal temperatures across most o=
f
the Mainland and Panhandle. Above normal temperatures are likely over the
Aleutians due to the increasing influence from the ridging to the south, an=

across the northeastern Mainland, consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast
tools.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast indicates increased probabilities for n=
ear
to below normal precipitation across the southern half of the CONUS, and
enhanced chances for near to above normal precipitation across much of the
northern tier. Increased troughing in the West favors the development of on=

or
more surface low pressure systems to track across the northern CONUS, bring=
ing
enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities across portions of the
Northern Plains, Central and Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are elevated across
much of southern Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians, consistent with
continued westerly to southwesterly mid-level flow, while probabilities of
near
normal precipitation are enhanced over the Panhandle under rising near norm=
al
mid-level heights.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Heavy rainfall possible from eastern Texas to the lower
Mississippi Valley on Sunday and then across the Deep South
Tuesday to Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue the theme of broad upper-level
troughing sliding across the northern tier states as the southern
stream directs a generally southwesterly flow across the
mid-section of the country toward the Northeast.  Models again
exhibit a trend for a faster/more progressive northern stream
flow, which helps sharpening a slow-moving front that extends from
the Mid-Mississippi Valley to New England.  In addition, models
continue to struggle with predicting the multiple wave
interactions along the northern stream, lending to the greatest
amount of forecast uncertainty across the northern tier states
into the Northeast for the longer range period.

Across the western Gulf Coast states, an upper-level trough/low
will lift northeastward across the southern Plains late this
weekend with a threat of heavy rain mainly from the lower
Mississippi Valley westward to eastern Texas.  Meanwhile, models
agree well regarding the next upper-level trough forecast to exit
the central Rockies early next week with a period of enhanced
rainfall for the High Plains and some significant late-season wet
snow possible along the Front Range of Colorado.  This wave will
likely play a key role in setting up a possible heavy rain event
across the Deep South ahead of a cold front by Tuesday and into
Wednesday.  Remaining moisture will likely move into the East
Coast mid-week before a general drying trend sets in as the upper
trough is forecast to edge toward the coast.  Meanwhile, moisture
from the next Pacific cyclone is forecast to reach the Pacific
Northwest toward the latter part of next week.

The WPC product suite was derived from a composite blend of the 00
UTC ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS and some contribution from the 00Z
Canadian/CMC mean, with increasing usage of the ensemble means
toward Day 7.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf of Mexico moisture and instability ahead of the initial
trough/closed low over the Southern Plains on Sunday will fuel
numerous showers and thunderstorms across parts of the central
Gulf Coast states and into the Tennessee Valley Sunday-Monday.
Confidence is increasing in heavy rainfall potential in this
region, some of which has already seen above normal precipitation
over the past few weeks. This would likely increase the flooding
threat as well. The system is expected to shear northeastward into
early/mid next week with a swath of enhanced rainfall possible
farther north into the Ohio Valley and the Northeast.

The next system into the western U.S. should support mountain
snows across the Colorado Rockies and organized rainfall over the
central High Plains Sunday-Monday.  As the troughing amplifies
across the Plains on Tuesday, moderate to heavy rainfall should
develop along and ahead of a cold front.  Again, the threat seems
to be centered over much of the same region as the previous system
-- central Gulf Coast/Tennessee Valley/lower Ohio Valley Tuesday
into Wednesday.

The eastern U.S. should stay above normal in terms of temperatures
much of the period ahead and south of a wavy frontal boundary. The
western U.S. system will spread below to much below normal
temperatures from the Rockies into the Plains Monday and Tuesday,
moderating as the system moves eastward.  Meanwhile, much of the
Western Coast to Desert Southwest will see a warming trend
Monday-Thursday as upper level ridging builds aloft.

0148 AM CDT Fri Apr 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN MONTANA AND WESTERN NORTH
DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
Amplified mid-level ridging centered over the Four Corners will
drive strong northwesterly flow with an embedded shortwave trough
across the northern Rockies/Plains while multi-episodic troughing
develops across the East Coast. At the surface, high pressure across
the central Plains will shift southeastward into the Ohio Valley,
while a clipper-like low and surface trough are forecast to move
into northern Minnesota by 06z Saturday.

...Northern Plains...
The mid-level shortwave trough across the western Canadian provinces
will augment low and mid-level pressure gradients across much of
Montana and into the western Dakotas through the day. Surface
pressure falls ahead of the clipper low and surface trough will
enhance northwesterly surface winds to 20-30 mph by early afternoon.
Dry continental trajectories and the downslope nature of the flow
will support widespread critical humidity values of 13-15% atop very
dry fuels. Thus, critical fire weather conditions are expected
across eastern Montana and western North Dakota through this
evening.

...Virginia and the Carolinas...
Post-frontal high pressure shifting into the Ohio Valley will drive
northwesterly flow across the Appalachians and offshore across the
eastern coast of the Carolinas. The dry continental trajectories and
diurnal heating under mostly clear skies will support minimum
surface humidity values in the 25-35% range atop near record dry
fuels. Vertical mixing in the lowest several km of the column will
support momentum transfer from a 60-70 kt northwesterly jet aloft.
Sustained surface winds of 10-20 mph and higher gusts will likely
support elevated fire weather conditions through the afternoon. A
second weaker cold front later in the evening should effectively end
the threat as cooler temperatures and higher humidity recoveries
develop overnight.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CDT Fri Apr 30 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level ridge across the center of the CONUS will flatten
significantly through the first half of the forecast period as
increasing southwesterly flow aloft develops over the West ahead of
a Pacific trough. A closed low over northern Mexico will open and
drift northeast across Texas as East Coast troughing continues. At
the surface, a low over the upper Midwest will gradually fill as a
lee low is forecast to develop across the central Plains and Gulf
moisture begins to return across the eastern half of the CONUS.
Gusty winds across the Great Basin and the northern Plains will
likely support elevated fire weather conditions through the period.

...Southern Great Basin...
Warm and dry surface conditions are expected through the afternoon
hours with temperatures in the 80s to 90s F and humidity of 10-15%.
Model soundings across the area show modest southwesterly flow aloft
of 20-30 kt developing through the day. Deep mixing from the warm
surface temperatures should result in momentum transport to the
surface bolstering winds to around 10-20 mph. The overlap of winds,
humidity, and dry fuels will be more than sufficient for widespread
elevated fire weather conditions to develop. Locally critical fire
weather conditions also appear possible given the favorable
parameter space. However, some uncertainty on the strength of the
mid-level flow and resulting surface winds casts doubt on how
widespread any critical fire weather conditions will be.

...Northern Plains...
Lingering gusty winds behind a weakening low across the upper
Midwest will be sufficient to support elevated fire weather
potential through the afternoon hours across eastern Montana and the
western Dakotas. Model soundings show a deeply mixed boundary layer
with temperatures in the 60s and 70s F. Humidity values will likely
be higher than Day1/Friday around 25-35%, but the combination of
very dry fuels and modest surface flow will support elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon hours.

...Central Plains...
Increasing southerly flow ahead of the developing lee low is
expected through the afternoon Day2/Saturday across portions of
western Kansas and eastern Colorado. South winds of 10-20 mph along
with warm temperatures and dry air ahead of the return of Gulf
moisture should support surface RH of 15-20% through peak heating. A
relative minimum in precipitation across the region over the last
several days suggests some potential for brief locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon hours, before a much more
humid airmass arrives after sunset.

...Heavy rainfall becoming more likely across the Deep South
Tuesday into Wednesday...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

An active weather pattern is forecast to continue going into the
medium range period next week as two significant troughs cross the
southern tier states and result in heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms.  Meanwhile, an upper level ridge becomes
established over the Intermountain West towards the end of the
week ahead of the next Pacific storm system that will likely reach
the West Coast by next Friday.

The 00Z model suite is in above average agreement through Tuesday
across the continental U.S., and for this time period a general
blend of the UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/CMC sufficed as a starting point in
the forecast process.  By Wednesday, the guidance diverges more on
timing of smaller individual shortwaves in the northern stream
flow, and thus precipitation coverage and placement across the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest later in the forecast period is
less certain.  By Friday, there is good agreement that an
organized Pacific storm system will affect the West Coast, with
the GFS a bit more progressive than the slower ECMWF/CMC
solutions, so leaning towards the slower timing seems prudent for
now.  There is also some indication of a potential coastal low
near the Mid-Atlantic region to close out the week, although
details remain uncertain.  More of the NAEFS/EC means were
incorporated for the Thursday through Friday time period.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Multiple rounds of moderate to heavy rainfall are likely across
portions of the central and southern tier states next week as
multiple disturbances cross the region.  The region that appears
most favored for excessive rainfall is the Deep South, mainly from
northern Louisiana to the southern Appalachians, where 3 to 5
inches of rain may be realized in some areas.  Most of this should
fall during the Tuesday-Wednesday time period ahead of the slow
moving cold front.  This may be enough to cause some flooding,
particularly where convective training develops or across areas
that will have already received noteworthy rain prior to Monday.
Across the Wyoming and Colorado Rockies, a late season snow event
is likely for the higher elevations west of Denver and Cheyenne,
with several inches of accumulation possible.

In terms of temperatures, highs are expected to be about 5-15
degrees above average for much of the eastern U.S. ahead of the
front for early next week, with some 90 degree readings likely
across portions of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont on
Tuesday.  This will be followed by a return to more seasonal
temperatures to close out the week behind the cold front, and
perhaps slightly below normal.  Across the western U.S., heat is
expected to build in response to the upper level ridge, with highs
10-20 degrees above normal possible for the middle to end of the
week for portions of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest.  This will equate to some 100+ degree high temperatures
for the lower elevations of eastern California and southern
Arizona.

...Heavy rain and flash flooding likely across portions of
southern Texas through Saturday...

...Gusty and potentially damaging winds found along the
southern/central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast today...

...Record-breaking heat forecast throughout Southern California,
the Intermountain West, and into the Northern High Plains to end
the workweek...

The sole weather hazard associated with precipitation over the
next few days will be found throughout southern Texas. A stalled
frontal boundary draped across the region and a closed upper-level
low located over northern Mexico will help funnel moisture from
the western Gulf of Mexico into the Lone Star State. Showers and
thunderstorms are already impacting parts of southern Texas, with
more on the way for the first half of the weekend. The heaviest
rainfall amounts today are forecast to occur along and just inland
from the southern/middle Texas Coast. When all is said and done,
upwards of 7 additional inches of rain could fall. This amount of
rain will likely lead to flash flooding where the most intense
downpours occur. Therefore, WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
Excessive Rainfall across the aforementioned region, including
Corpus Christi, Texas. Rainfall on Saturday will gradually spread
further north across central Texas as the frontal boundary slowly
lifts in that direction. A few thunderstorms may produce damaging
winds and isolated tornadoes today and Saturday across southern
Texas as well.

Meanwhile, a rapidly deepening low pressure system is exiting off
the the New England coastline this morning and will produce high
winds from the southern Appalachians to the Northeast. Winds could
gust as high as 60 mph between northern Virginia and New Jersey.
This will likely lead to downed trees and power lines this
afternoon and evening. High Wind Warnings and Wind Advisories have
been issued to highlight the hazard. Along with the howling
northwesterly winds, below average temperatures will bring the
chance for late-April snow showers throughout the Northeast and
New England.

Elsewhere across the Lower 48, well above normal temperatures will
stretch from California to the northern/central Plains today,
extending into the Upper Great Lakes on Saturday. High
temperatures are forecast to break several daily record highs to
end the week from Southern California to Montana, with 80s found
as far north as the U.S.-Canada border. Fire weather is a concern
across the northern Plains as low relative humidity and gusty
winds could produce conditions ripe for fires to spread
uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings have been issued across eastern
Montana, western North Dakota, and northwestern South Dakota.

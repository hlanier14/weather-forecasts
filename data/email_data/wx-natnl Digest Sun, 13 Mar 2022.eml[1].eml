Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1007 AM CST Sat Mar 12 2022

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

An Elevated fire weather risk area is introduced for portions of
northwest Texas. Mid-morning surface observations show RH values
already falling into the 25-35% range across portions of
west-central and northwest TX, and gradient winds are beginning to
increase with sustained winds between 15-20 mph. Poor boundary-layer
moisture is noted in the 12Z MAF sounding, which should support
additional drying as boundary-layer mixing deepens through the day.
As a result, widespread RH reductions to 15-25% appear likely and
should be coincident with 15-20 mph winds across northwest TX.
Despite the light snowfall yesterday, CoCoRaHs reports and MRMS
estimates were generally less than 0.05 inches, which is most likely
not sufficient to prevent quick drying of fine grasses after several
hours of dry/windy conditions this afternoon.

..Moore.. 03/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1237 AM CST Sat Mar 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will exit the eastern coast early in the
day today. In the West, upper-level ridging will shift across the
Great Basin into the High Plains. Surface high pressure and cold air
will continue to filter southward into the Gulf basin. A shortwave
trough within northwesterly flow across the Divide will promote lee
troughing in parts of the High Plains.

A dry low-level airmass will be situated across the Southwest into
the southern Plains. Surface winds in the southern Plains will shift
back to southwesterly along the western flank of the surface high.
With modest lee troughing to the west, a few hours of around 15 mph
winds and 15-20% RH are possible. Due to recent precipitation and
cold temperatures, fire weather concerns are expected to remain low
as fine-fuel moisture will remain elevated.

...Overview...
A few waves cross the lower 48 in a progressive pattern that is
active for the Pacific Northwest. A leading southern stream system
will shift east across the Deep South/Gulf Coast Tuesday into
Wednesday before lifting northeast over the Carolinas and off the
southern Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday. The next upper trough will
push inland over the Pacific Northwest Tuesday and dig a bit as it
shifts east over the southern Intermountain West Wednesday and the
southern Rockies Wednesday night before turning east-northeast and
to the Midwest/Great Lakes through Friday. This should make for a
return to wet weather for the south-central at the end of the work
week and the Midwest/Northeast next weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
The 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS are in excellent agreement
with the strength and timing of the leading southern stream system
through Wednesday before the 06Z GFS (and now the 12Z GFS) becomes
more progressive with the exit off Cape Hatteras Wednesday night.
The GFS remains farther north with the next wave over the southern
Rockies Wednesday night and then is more unified with the northern
and southern stream troughs as that wave shifts to the Midwest
while the 00Z ECMWF/CMC have notable separation. Therefore, a
blend of the four main global models for Days 3 and 4 becomes more
reliant on ensemble means on Day 5 and are majority ensemble means
for 6/7.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
Ample Gulf moisture will be drawn ahead of the Deep South system
Tuesday into Wednesday, which should combine with sufficient
instability to bring widespread thunderstorms capable of producing
heavy rainfall and locally excessive rain, especially over north
Florida which is an area that received heavy rain over the past
day. Precipitation over the Intermountain West Tuesday
night/Wednesday will weaken as Pacific Moisture is cut off from
the wave. However, as the wave amplifies over the southern Rockies
a moderate return of moisture can be expected from the Gulf of
Mexico which will an emerging and expanding area of rain and
thunderstorms from the south-central to east-central U.S. Thursday
through Saturday, albeit in a pattern with increasing forecast
spread with the progression and strength determined by the
aforementioned interaction of the northern and southern stream
components.

Ridging between the Southeast and West systems will bring
temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above normal to the central/northern
Plains Tuesday. This warm airmass shifts east, reaching the
interior Northeast by Friday.

...Overview...
A few waves cross the lower 48 in a progressive pattern that is
active for the Pacific Northwest. A leading southern stream system
will shift east across the Deep South/Gulf Coast Tuesday into
Wednesday before lifting northeast over the Carolinas and off the
southern Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday. The next upper trough will
push inland over the Pacific Northwest Tuesday and dig a bit as it
shifts east over the southern Intermountain West Wednesday and the
southern Rockies Wednesday night before turning east-northeast and
to the Midwest/Great Lakes through Friday. This should make for a
return to wet weather for the south-central at the end of the work
week and the Midwest/Northeast next weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
The 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS are in excellent agreement
with the strength and timing of the leading southern stream system
through Wednesday before the 06Z GFS (and now the 12Z GFS) becomes

...Record breaking cold throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee
Valley, and Southeast on Sunday morning...

...Locally heavy rain and mountain snow to affect the Pacific
Northwest beginning tonight...

...Swath of light-to-moderate snow possible across the Upper
Midwest on Monday...


A powerful and strengthening low pressure system will race
northeastward away from New England this evening and into the
Canadian Maritimes. As it does so, an associated cold front will
continue to surge into the western Atlantic and leave behind a
bitterly cold airmass throughout much of the eastern United States
and gusty winds over parts of the Northeast. Areas that received
snow today from the Tennessee Valley to the Northeast will likely
experience temperatures bottoming out into the teens on Sunday
morning. Meanwhile, lows in the 20s and 30s will extend all the
way to the Gulf Coast and Southeast coastline. Much of northern
Florida will also contend with subfreezing temperatures to start
off the day. These cold and potentially record breaking
temperatures could pose a threat to sensitive vegetation and
unprotected outdoor plumbing in the Southeast. Freeze Warnings
extend from far southeast Texas to South Carolina and central
Florida. Fortunately, temperatures are expected to quickly rebound
to near normal by Tuesday as high pressure slips off the East
Coast and ushers in warmer southerly winds.

For the Pacific Northwest, a potent low pressure system is
forecast to move inland near the Washington-Oregon border on
Sunday. Locally heavy rain will remain a possibility across
coastal regions and the low elevation, with heavy mountain snow
throughout the Cascades (mainly above 3000 feet). As the
associated upper-level trough races into the Central Plains on
Monday, a strong upper-level jet streak will create a ripe
environment for a narrow swath of moderate snow throughout the
Upper Midwest on Monday. Snowfall amounts of 2 to 4 inches are
possible in northern Wisconsin and the southern U.P. of Michigan.

Elsewhere, a cold front is forecast to race southward and into the
Southern Plains by Monday. Gusty winds and low relative humidity
will make for critical fire weather conditions from eastern New
Mexico across the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma.
Additionally, on the warm side of this system return flow out of
the western Gulf of Mexico is anticipated to collide with the
approaching cold front near the Arklatex region. As a result,
numerous showers and scattered thunderstorms are likely to develop
by Monday evening. A few storms could turn severe, which has
prompted SPC to issue a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms for East Texas and the Arklatex between Monday
afternoon and evening.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat March 12 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

1132 PM CST Sat Mar 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will approach the Southwest during this
afternoon. This feature will help deepen an eastern Colorado surface
low. With an already dry airmass across the southern Plains, dry and
windy conditions during the afternoon will bring about elevated to
critical fire weather.

...Southern Plains...
Saturday evening's observed regional soundings show widespread
low-level dry air. Though winds have already turned to southerly
along the western flank of the surface ridge, trajectories will
remain mostly continental or have very limited modification from the
Gulf. While the stronger winds aloft will lag to the west, flow
within the lowest 3 km will be strong. Sustained winds of 20-25 mph
are possible along with higher gusts. RH in parts of western Texas
could fall near 10%. Farther east and north, 15-25% is more
probable. The greatest confidence in critical fire weather is within
the Texas Panhandle into western Oklahoma and western North Texas.
Uncertainty is greatest into southern Kansas and eastern Oklahoma
due to potentially higher RH and non-zero impact from recent
snowfall. In considering Saturday's observed minimum RH values, some
expansion of the elevated was made north and east as it seems
reasonable to give some deference to the more aggressively dry
solutions for Sunday.

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TRANS-PECOS AND BIG BEND REGIONS
OF TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough across the Southwest will continue to the
southeast on Monday. The surface low will move along with the
trough. As the trough and low pass through the southern High Plains,
a cold front will then move southward into the region, reaching the
Gulf Coast by Tuesday morning.

...Trans-Pecos/Big Bend Vicinity...
With the mid-level jet losing some potency and becoming more compact
with time, the low-level response to it will not be overly strong.
While surface winds may reach 20-25 mph in some places, more
widespread values near 30 mph are not expected except on a localized
basis. Higher gusts will be possible, particularly in higher
terrain, as the mid-level jet will move over the region during the
afternoon. RH near 10% is possible. Values closer to 15-20% are more
likely into southern New Mexico and the Permian Basin. Critical fire
weather is likely during the afternoon. Gusty winds are possible
behind the cold front by late afternoon. RH recovery seems likely to
occur, but winds will shift to northerly.

...Eastern New Mexico...Texas Panhandle/South Plains...
Some guidance shows RH falling to near 20% after the front passes.
However, this is fairly uncertain as modest cooling and some clouds
are expected. Elevated conditions that may develop are not expected
to be widespread or long lasting.

140 AM EST Sun Mar 13 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 16 2022 - 12Z Sun Mar 20 2022

...Overview...
A relatively progressive and gradually more amplified flow pattern
across the Lower 48 during the period will allow several storm
systems to move quickly through the CONUS. To start, a Southeast
coastal system will track up the Carolina coast mid-week before
tracking offshore. Low pressure organizing in the southern Plains
Thursday is likely to lift through the Central U.S. Friday into
Saturday bringing active weather to central/eastern U.S. while the
Pacific Northwest remains unsettled with widespread precipitation
likely returning next weekend. No significant cold air outbreaks
are anticipated and temperatures will oscillate between normal and
much above normal ahead of the various waves of low pressure.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Through day 5, the deterministic guidance offered very good
agreement and predictability with the main synoptic features over
the CONUS. For the Southeast system early on, the GFS is a
slightly faster/progressive solution with a more northerly low
track, which seems to be where guidance has trended over the last
several cycles. The shortwave trough coming out into the Plains
Day 4/5 looks to have the typical timing biases, where the GFS is
on the faster side but otherwise the deterministic models show
fairly agreeable amplitude. By day 6/7, the flow pattern is
trending more amplified over the CONUS, with deep troughing
becoming more favored over the western U.S. and also over the
eastern U.S.. By this point, the deterministic guidance varies a
lot, with the CMC vs. GFS/ECMWF nearly out of phase. For now, the
deterministic GFS/ECMWF and its ensemble means have good support
so the WPC blend days 5-7 was comprised of the deterministic
GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECENS, removing the CMC/CMCE with the majority
of the blended weights toward the ensemble means.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...
The slow moving southern stream system tracking along the Gulf
Coast and Southeast will draw up plenty of moisture and combined
with sufficient instability and forcing should bring widespread
thunderstorms Wednesday-Thursday. Some threat of locally heavy
rainfall exists along the coast where better ingredients look to
exist. The next wave of low pressure lifting through the central
U.S. into the Great Lakes late Thursday into Saturday will work
with increasing Gulf moisture and large scale lift. This should
result in an expanding area of showers and thunderstorms with some
potential of winter weather on the cold/northwest side of the
system, though details on any significant accumulations are too
uncertain at this time. Finally, by next weekend, another large
scale and potentially strong system will move into the western
U.S. bringing beneficial rainfall to the Pacific Northwest and
perhaps as far south as central California. No major Arctic air
intrusions are expected through the period and temperatures will
generally trend normal to above normal with the greatest
departures from normal expected along/ahead of the various waves
of low pressure moving through the flow.

...Record breaking cold throughout the Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee
Valley, and Southeast on Sunday morning; swath of
light-to-moderate snow possible across the Upper Midwest on
Monday...

...A pair of storm systems to produce locally heavy rain and
mountain snow throughout the Pacific Northwest...

...Critical fire weather conditions in the Southern High Plains
today and Monday; severe weather possible in the ArkLaTex late
Monday and early Tuesday...

A frigid Canadian air-mass has infiltrated much of the eastern
U.S. this morning in wake of yesterday's significant winter storm.
Record low temperatures are forecast from the Mid-Atlantic and
Tennessee Valley on south into northern and central Florida. In
addition to the record lows, Freeze Warnings have been posted due
to subfreezing temperatures from the central Gulf Coast to
northern Florida and South Carolina. There are also Wind Chill
Advisories in place for parts of the Southeast and the southern
and central Appalachians. Temperatures will feel more like
February as daytime high temperature anomalies throughout the Deep
South and up the East Coast range between 10 to 20 degrees below
normal. Temperatures will gradually moderate throughout the East
on Monday with the Northeast expected to see the return of more
seasonal conditions. The Deep South can expect seasonally cool
temps to stick around into the first half of the week. While
winter's chill wains in the East, a swath of snow is forecast to
set up over the Upper Midwest as an upper level disturbance
approaches from the northern Rockies. Several inches are possible
in northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and northern Michigan
late Sunday night into Monday.

In the Pacific Northwest, a potent frontal system is moving inland
today bringing heavy precipitation and gusty winds Sunday morning.
Locally heavy rain will remain a possibility across coastal
regions and the low elevation, with heavy mountain snow throughout
the Cascades (mainly above 3000 feet). Wind gusts exceeding 60 mph
are also possible in southern Oregon the first half of Sunday,
resulting in the issuance of High Wind Warnings. A brief lull in
the action arrives Sunday afternoon and evening before the next
surge of Pacific moisture associated with another approaching
storm system arrives late Monday. Periods of coastal/valley rain
will fall heavily at times Monday night while snow falls in the
Washington and Oregon Cascades. Welcomed rainfall and mountains
snow eventually tracks into northern California by Tuesday
morning.

Elsewhere, gusty winds and low relative humidity levels are a
recipe for critical fire weather conditions from eastern New
Mexico across the Texas Panhandle and into western Oklahoma today.
As a cold front races south on Monday, the critical fire weather
threat shifts to West Texas where the combination of strong wind
gusts and low relative humidity levels are expected to take shape.
Additionally, a strengthening area of low pressure in the Southern
Plains Monday evening will tap into rich Gulf of Mexico moisture
that is forecast to collide with the approaching cold front near
the Arklatex region. As a result, numerous showers and scattered
thunderstorms are likely to develop by Monday evening and continue
into early morning Tuesday. A few storms could become severe,
which has prompted SPC to issue a Slight Risk (level 2/5) for
severe thunderstorms for East Texas and the Arklatex between
Monday evening and into early Tuesday morning.

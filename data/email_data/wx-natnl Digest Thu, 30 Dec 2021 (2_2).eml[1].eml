...More heavy mountain snow to overtake much of the Intermountain
West to close out 2021; bitterly cold wind chills to stick around
in the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains; Slight Risk for
Excessive Rainfall in Southern California today..

...Record breaking Spring-like temperatures in the South to reach
the portions of the East Coast; Slight Risks for severe storms and
Excessive Rainfall on Friday...

...Both winter weather and severe weather possible to kick off the
new year this weekend...

The continental U.S. remains under the influence of prolonged
troughing in the Intermountain West and ridging in the Southeast.
The next upper level disturbance to round the base of this trough
is set to enter the Northwestern U.S. this morning, providing
another round of moderate-to-heavy snow throughout much of the
Intermountain West. Meanwhile, a developing storm system in the
East Pacific ushers Pacific moisture into Southern California and
the Southwest both today and Friday. Locally heavy rainfall rates
could cause flash flooding in Southern California (Slight Risk
today in the Los Angeles metro area) and south-central Arizona
(Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall on Friday) but it also
supplies another round of moisture into the southern Rockies. This
combined with the arrival of another Arctic air-mass makes for
another period of heavy mountain snow Friday night. By Saturday
morning, mountain ranges such as the Cascades, Sawtooth, Wasatch,
and both the central and southern Rockies can expect 1 to 2 feet
of snow with totals exceeding 3 feet in the highest elevations of
Utah and Colorado. A myriad of winter weather alerts; from
Warnings and Watches to Advisories, have been issued in these
areas. As previously mentioned, another injection of frigid Arctic
air causes temperatures to plummet throughout the West on Friday
and into Saturday morning with sub-zero temperatures expected from
the Upper Mississippi Valley to the Northern Rockies. Wind Chill
Warnings and Advisories remain in effect for the far North Central
U.S. today for the present frigid air-mass, but expect more
bitterly cold wind chills Friday and into Saturday.

Farther east, the atmosphere continues to believe the calendar has
skipped winter all together and entered spring. Abnormally warm
and humid conditions will stick around in the Southeast with
considerably milder conditions spreading as far north as the
Northeast by New Year's Day. Numerous record warm lows and highs
are expected from the Gulf Coast to the northern Mid-Atlantic
through Saturday morning. The troughing in the West and the strong
ridge of high pressure over the Southeast are working together to
funnel rich Gulf of Mexico moisture into the Mid-South late
Friday. There is a Marginal Risk for both severe weather and
Excessive Rainfall in parts of the Southeast today, but the next
developing storm system in the Plains will set the stage for
another active day of severe weather from North Texas to the
southern Appalachians on Friday. Ample moisture and instability is
also present to support Excessive Rainfall rates, making flash
flooding a concern in the Middle Mississippi and Ohio/Tennessee
River Valleys. As a result, Slight Risks have been issued for both
severe storms and flash flooding in these regions with concerns
for nocturnal severe weather and localized flooding.

As the storm system responsible for Friday's potential severe
weather and flash flooding event emerges into the South Central
U.S. Saturday morning, the New Year is forecast to start off in
wintry fashion as measurable snowfall and an icy wintry mix are
expected to paint a swath of hazardous travel conditions New
Year's Day from the front range of the Rockies to the Midwest and
Great Lakes. Meanwhile, within the storm's warm sector, another
busy day of severe weather and Excessive Rainfall is likely in the
Mid-South. Residents in these regions are encouraged check for the
latest forecasts from their local NWS offices and National Centers
as a plethora of weather hazards; from bitterly cold wind chills
and travel-disruptive snowfall totals to severe storms and flash
flooding will make for a treacherous start to 2022.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Lower Mississippi Valley through Thursday morning...

...Light snow from parts of the Middle Mississippi, Southern Ohio
Valleys, and the Mid-Atlantic; light to moderate snow over parts
of the Northeast on Wednesday...

...There is a Risk of rain/freezing rain over parts of the
Southern Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley on Wednesday...

...There is a Risk of scattered rain/freezing rain over parts of
the Western Gulf Coast to the southern Mid-Atlantic on Thursday...

Low pressure over Ontario, Canada, will move into the Canadian
Maritimes by Thursday morning. The associated front will move off
most of the East Coast and the Gulf Coast by Thursday evening. A
wave of low pressure along the boundary will linger over parts of
the Southeast through Friday. Moisture from the Western Gulf of
Mexico will start to pool along the boundary over the eastern
portion of the front, developing rain over parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley,
starting around noon on Wednesday. Showers and thunderstorms will
develop over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and adjacent
areas, with these storms becoming severe. Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Lower Mississippi Valley through Thursday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

Incidentally, light snow will develop over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley into parts of the Ohio Valley starting late
Wednesday afternoon. Along the rain/snow line, areas of light
rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of the Southern
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday afternoon into Thursday morning. In the meantime, light
snow will develop over parts of Northern New England and expand
into other parts of the Northeast by Wednesday evening. Overnight
Wednesday, the snow will expand into eastern parts of the Ohio
Valley, Central Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic. Furthermore, the
rain over the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys moves into
parts of the Southern Appalachians and parts of the Mid-Atlantic
by Thursday morning. In the wake of the system, lake effect snow
will develop downwind from the Great Lakes through Friday.
Moreover, the light snow will end over most of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic by Thursday evening.However, along the rain/snow
line, scattered areas of rain/freezing rain will develop over
parts of the Western Gulf Coast to the southern Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday. Furthermore, the rain will continue over parts of the
Southeast through Friday morning.

Meanwhile, on Wednesday, the western portion of the front will
produce light snow over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies
through Thursday morning. In addition, energy moving across the
Southwest into the Southern Plains will produce light snow over
parts of the Southern High Plains overnight Wednesday evening into
Thursday afternoon. Elsewhere, weak onshore flow will produce
light rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest and some snow at
the higher elevations on Wednesday. Additionally, overnight
Wednesday, upper-level energy will move onshore over the Northwest
and move to the Northern Intermountain Region come Friday. The
energy will continue the rain over the Pacific Northwest coming to
an end overnight Thursday. Also, on Thursday, snow will increase
over the Northern Intermountain Region and expand into parts of
the Northern Rockies/Northern High Plains Thursday evening into
Friday.

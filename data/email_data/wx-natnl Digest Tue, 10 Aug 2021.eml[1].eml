1046 AM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Morning fuel guidance continues to show ERC values at or just below
seasonal normal for southern to southwest WY. Elevated to critical
wind/RH conditions remain likely across this region, and an isolated
dry thunderstorm or two is possible along the WY/CO border this
afternoon. However, modest fuel status/availability will limit the
overall fire weather threat. See the previous discussion below for
more details.

..Moore.. 08/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0145 AM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low will traverse the northern Rockies as it moves
east throughout the day. At the surface, a cold front will intensify
as it moves through Montana and Wyoming in the morning. Strong
westerly winds will accompany the front before gradually weakening
through the day. In the wake of the front, a cooler and drier
airmass is forecast to become established over the Intermountain
west. Surface humidity values will remain low, around 20%. While
winds will be strong initially, as they decrease through the day
favorable overlap with dry surface conditions and receptive fuels
conditions is expected to be negligible. No areas will be maintained
as fire weather threats will be limited to sparsely vegetated areas
of southern Wyoming.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: The mid-level height pattern is predicted to be weakly amplified
over
North America during week-2 with mid-level high pressure favored over the East
Pacific and Northeast, and weak mid-level low pressure more likely across the
western lower-48 states. This orientation is forecast to limit the chances for
hazardous weather across much of the country, although anomalously warm
temperatures are possible over parts of the north-central and northeastern
U.S.
A tropical disturbance currently over the central Atlantic has the potential
to
track toward the southeastern U.S. by the beginning of week-2, which may
enhance rainfall across portions of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic early in
the
period. However, there is considerable model spread regarding the track of
this
system, keeping probabilities on the lower side.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Mid-Atlantic, Appalachians,
and Southeast, Tue-Thu, Aug 17-19.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 12 - MONDAY AUGUST 16:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!voZaZE3n--M0dW4Dm5qSjyJ5BWjH_dgepdDeo6e0lC7RQ2vL6YiLyO-NpyvwXA404DJUp6Yd$

FOR TUESDAY AUGUST 17 - MONDAY AUGUST 23: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa height pattern over
North America. Mid-level ridging is forecast over the eastern Pacifc with weak
troughing downstream over the western CONUS. This favors some relief from the
heat over the West that is forecast during week-1. Additional mid-level
ridging
is favored across the Northeast, with the GEFS being more amplified with this
feature compared to the ECMWF and Canadian ensembles. Anomalously warm daytime
temperatures are predicted for the north-central CONUS, and extending through
the Great Lakes and into parts of the Northeast. Probabilities for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile in the GEFS reforecast tool are
notably high (>60%) over portions of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley early in the period. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates these
probabilities in the 20%-40% range, with probabilities for maximum
temperatures
exceeding 90 deg F remaining under 20% over the Upper Mississippi Valley and
the eastern Dakotas. Further to the west, where probabilities are higher, it
is
more aligned with climatology. Caution is given to the GEFS given its
persistent depiction of overly hot temperatures over the region, with the
relatively cooler ECMWF guidance preferred. Therefore, no related temperature
hazards are posted for the north-central CONUS. The same reasoning is also
applied for New England, where although the GEFS indicates greater potential
for hazardous heat, the ECMWF reforecast tool depicts probabilities of less
than 20% for maximum temperature exceeding 85 deg F, precluding a related
hazard. Additionally, heat risk guidance does not indicate elevated potential
for heat indices exceeding 100 deg F over much of the Northeast during the
period.



Increased tropical activity is favored across the Atlantic Basin during the
next two weeks as a result of the enhanced phase of the Madden Julian
Oscillation (MJO). The National Hurricane Center is monitoring a disturbance
over the central Atlantic (Invest 94L), which has a 80% chance for development
into a tropical cyclone over the next 5-days. Models generally agree on a
track
near or over the Greater Antilles, and favor a weaker storm due to enhanced
land interaction and an unfavorable shearing environment in the guidance.
Track
uncertainty increases afterwards, with the deterministic ECMWF and its
ensembles turning the system northward across Florida and bringing it into the
mid-Atlantic. The GEFS maintains a more westerly track with a later and slower
turn to the north. Surface high pressure forecast over the Northeast may also
limit the northward progression. A slight risk for heavy rain is highlighted
over portions of the Mid-Atlantic, Appalachians, and Southeast for Aug 17-19
as
a result of this potential system. The uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble depicts at
least a 20% chance rainfall exceeds an inch over the period across much of the
highlighted area. Interests are advised to refer to the National Hurricane
Center for the latest information on this disturbance and any others that may
also develop, and the Weather Prediction Center for updated precipitation
forecasts throughout the week-1 period.



A zonal mid-level flow pattern is forecast across Alaska during week-2 due to
the placement of ridging over the Eastern Pacific. As a result, intermittent
surface low pressure systems are predicted to move across the state, generally
favoring below normal temperatures and slightly above normal precipitation
across most of the state. Pre-defined hazards criteria are not expected to be
reached and the cool, wet pattern should help reduce fuels for wildfires.

...Major Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high temperature
records into the weekend...

...Tropical moisture brings a heavy rain threats to the Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Overview...

Deterministic guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for
the overall pattern of a rather amplified ridge drifting east
across the West Coast and a deep low over lifting north from
Hudson Bay Thursday through Saturday. There are then some timing
and strength differences for the next through entering the Pacific
Northwest/BC on Sunday into Monday. A tropical wave approaches
Florida or the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend with preceding
tropical moisture reaching into the Mid-Atlantic. The strong
ridging over the West will support an extreme heat wave that
affects the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin/California into
or through the weekend with temperatures over some areas expected
to reach or exceed daily records for both highs and especially
warm lows. Across the eastern third of the country, associated
fronts and leading warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and
thunderstorms, some locally heavy at times, particularly ahead of
an approaching cold front and any tropical low center that
develops.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Acceptable agreement with the 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS was
sufficient to allow a simple blend of these through Day 5. The GFS
continues to be much more amplified with the next wave into BC
Saturday into Sunday which draws a low off the Pacific Northwest
inland while the ECMWF/CMC leave a low offshore. Based on this
difference and related downstream differences, went heavier toward
a GEFS/ECENS mean blend for Days 6 and 7. Regarding a tropical
wave approaching the CONUS from the Antilles this weekend, there
is decent agreement to having a cyclone develop and track toward
FL or the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The Northwest heat wave should produce several days with max/min
temperatures of 10-20F above normal across the Pacific Northwest
through Saturday night. Anomalies for daytime highs should be the
greatest around Thursday/Friday when a few locations, perhaps
centered over Portland, OR could reach 20-25F above normal. Dozens
of locations across the Northwest and into northern CA/NV should
see readings reach/exceed daily records for high max and mins. By
Sunday and Monday the highs may moderate somewhat as the ridge
gets eroded by incoming shortwave energy, but morning lows should
remain quite warm. Currently expect this heat wave to be less
extreme than the all-time record event in late June but still be
of major significance for the Portland-Seattle corridor.

As the upper ridge axis shifts east, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase again which brings a localized
flash flood risk. The current guidance consensus indicates Arizona
as the main threat area.

A cold front pushes southeast from the northern Plains/Great Lakes
Thursday night, reaching the East Coast and Southeast this
weekend, will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period. Some
areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely, particularly
Saturday as tropical moisture meets the front from the central
Appalachians to the TN Valley and then east to the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast on Sunday. Farther ahead of the front, daily
scattered storm chances will also exist over the East and Deep
South within a warm and moist environment. Florida sees rainfall
increase Friday into the weekend due to a tropical wave/surface
low and some upper level energy moving into the area from the
Bahamas/Cuba. The National Hurricane Center continues to monitor
this system for further tropical development in the next few days.

Very warm to hot conditions prevail to the east and south of the
cold front through Friday. The highest anomalies of plus 10-15F
are most likely for morning lows from the Great Lakes into the
Northeast Thursday night-Friday night with several more daily
records possible Friday morning. The combined heat and humidity
should support heat index values into at least the low 100s for
many lower elevations on Friday from the Mid-Atlantic to eastern
TX. High heat index values are suppressed by the cold front
Saturday and Sunday to over the lower Mississippi Valley along
with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast.

...Major Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high temperature
records into the weekend...

...Tropical moisture brings a heavy rain threats to the Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Overview...

Deterministic guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for
the overall pattern of a rather amplified ridge drifting east
across the West Coast and a deep low over lifting north from
Hudson Bay Thursday through Saturday. There are then some timing
and strength differences for the next through entering the Pacific
Northwest/BC on Sunday into Monday. A tropical wave approaches
Florida or the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend with preceding
tropical moisture reaching into the Mid-Atlantic. The strong
ridging over the West will support an extreme heat wave that
affects the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin/California into
or through the weekend with temperatures over some areas expected
to reach or exceed daily records for both highs and especially
warm lows. Across the eastern third of the country, associated
fronts and leading warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and
thunderstorms, some locally heavy at times, particularly ahead of
an approaching cold front and any tropical low center that
develops.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Acceptable agreement with the 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS was
sufficient to allow a simple blend of these through Day 5. The GFS
continues to be much more amplified with the next wave into BC
Saturday into Sunday which draws a low off the Pacific Northwest
inland while the ECMWF/CMC leave a low offshore. Based on this
difference and related downstream differences, went heavier toward
a GEFS/ECENS mean blend for Days 6 and 7. Regarding a tropical
wave approaching the CONUS from the Antilles this weekend, there
is decent agreement to having a cyclone develop and track toward
FL or the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

temperatures of 10-20F above normal across the Pacific Northwest

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 PM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on recent guidance (see discussion below for details).
Monsoonal moisture over southern AZ will gradually spread
northwestward along the Sierra tomorrow and may support a
thunderstorm or two. While dry lightning strikes are possible,
confidence in the coverage of storms is too low to warrant
highlights at this time.

..Moore.. 08/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CDT Mon Aug 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime will remain in places across the
northern Rockies/Plains through the forecast period as an upper low
moves slowly to the east. A second trough/low over central Canada
will move to the south and east slowing as it approaches the
international border. In response to the secondary low, a cold front
across the Plains will stall. Gusty northwest winds behind the front
are expected to support elevated fire weather conditions across
southern Montana and portions of western south Dakota.

...Southern Montana and western South Dakota...
Along the southern portion of the slow moving upper low, mid-level
westerly flow in excess of 40 kts will overspread much of Montana
and the Dakotas. Westerly surface winds of 15-20 mph will likely
develop through the afternoon. The dry downslope winds and deep
mixing will favor low surface humidity values of 25-30%. The
resulting overlap of dry and windy conditions will support elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions where fuels are dry.

Farther south across Wyoming, the stronger upper level winds will be
displaced farther to the north and east. This should result in
weaker surface winds across much of the state. However, periodic
winds of 15-20 mph may occur through the day supporting locally
elevated condition within the dry airmass across southern portions
of the state. The greatest overlap of dry and breezy conditions
should develop within regions of sparse vegetation negating any
large fire weather risk.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon August 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 15 - 19 2021

GEFS, ECMWF, and CMC ensemble model solutions are in good agreement with
respect to the 500-hPa height pattern over North America during the 6-10 day
period. Near to below-normal mid-level heights are predicted over much of
Alaska, associated with a mean trough over the Bering Strait. Near to
above-normal heights are favored along the southern coast of the Alaska
Mainland, eastern Aleutians, and the Southeast Panhandle, influenced by a
strong Northeast Pacific ridge to the south. A strong mean mid-level ridge
over
the Northeast Pacific favors positive 500-hPa height anomalies across much of
the western CONUS, with the highest anomalies along the West Coast. A mean
mid-level trough over the eastern CONUS has drastically deamplified, relative
to yesterdays 6-10 day forecast, while mean troughing over the western CONUS
has amplified. Strong mean ridging over southeastern Canada favors positive
mid-level height anomalies across the Northern Plains, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. Negative mid-level height anomalies across much of the Southern
Tier
from the Four Corners to the Southeast are associated with a mean frontal
boundary and increased convective activity. The GEFS solution depicts stronger
mean ridging over southeastern Canada than the ECMWF and Canadian model
solutions. Additionally, the GEFS depicts a more amplified mean mid-level
trough over the western CONUS, relative to the Canadian and European
solutions,
increasing uncertainty from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Plains.

Below-normal temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska, ahead of
a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Strait. Above-normal temperatures are
favored over the West Coast, Great Basin, and Northern Rockies, along the
eastern periphery of the Northeast Pacific mid-level ridge. Strong positive
500-hPa height anomalies enhance odds for above-normal temperatures from the
Northern Plains to the Great Lakes, with enhanced above-normal temperature
probabilities extending into the Northeast. Convective activity along a mean
frontal boundary over the Southeast, in addition to the potential for tropical
activity during the 6-10 day period, favor near-normal temperatures across the
Southeast and Ohio Valley. Increase moisture advection and cloud cover enhance
odds for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest, extending eastward
into the Southern Plains.

Above-normal precipitation is favored from central to northern Mainland
Alaska,
ahead of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea increasing onshore flow.
Farther south along the southern coast, extending westward and eastward to the
Aleutians and Alaska Panhandle, respectively, near to below-normal
precipitation is favored, underneath increased influence from the Northeast
Pacific ridge. Along the eastern periphery of the ridge over the Northeast
Pacific, odds tilt toward below-normal precipitation for parts of the Pacific
Northwest and northern California. However, increased troughing over the West
increases odds of above-normal precipitation for the interior West. Increased
odds of above-normal precipitation are also favored across the Southwest due
to
an active Southwest Monsoon circulation; however, increased troughing across
the West is expected to shut down the wet phase of the Monsoon in the latter
half of the period. Over the eastern half of the CONUS, strong positive
mid-level height anomalies over southeastern Canada favor below-normal
precipitation across the Midwest and Northeast, extending southwestward to
include the Central Plains. Over the Southeast and Southern Plains, frontal
boundary activity increases odds for above-normal precipitation, with enhanced
odds over the Southeast, associated with an increased potential for tropical
activity during the 6-10 day period.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
large shift in model solutions since yesterday in the predicted mean 500-hPa
height pattern over the CONUS, despite overall good model agreement, and the
uncertainty surrounding the potential for tropical activity in the Southeast.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 17 - 23 2021

Models are in general agreement in their depictions of the major long-wave
features over North America during the Week-2 period. Positive 500-hPa height
anomalies are favored over southern Mainland Alaska, the Panhandle, and the
Aleutians, under increased influence of the Northeast Pacific ridge, relative
to the 6-10 day period. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies are depicted
northward of the Brooks Range in Alaska, associated with mean troughing over
the Bering Strait. Mean mid-level troughing has become more amplified,
relative
to yesterdays Week-2 forecast, over the western CONUS, increasing coverage of
below-normal heights over much of the interior West and Southwest. Similar to
the 6-10 day period, a strong mean mid-level ridge over southeastern Canada
favors positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending from the Upper Midwest to
the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic. Near to below-normal mid-level heights over
the
Southeast and Southern Plains are associated with increased convective
activity
along a mean frontal boundary across the Southern Tier.

Along the leading edge of a mid-level trough over the Bering Strait, increased
onshore flow favors below-normal temperatures across much of Mainland Alaska,
diminishing to near-normal along the southern coast, where mid-level height
anomalies become positive. Over the western CONUS, above-normal temperature
probabilities are influenced by the Northeast Pacific ridge. Amplified mean
troughing over the West favors near and below-normal temperatures across the
interior West and Southwest, respectively. Favored below-normal temperatures
in
the Southwest are supported by an active Southwest Monsoon season and
increased
seasonal soil moisture. Enhanced probabilities of above-normal temperatures
are
favored from the Northern and Central Plains eastward to the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast, underneath strong positive mid-level height anomalies. Near-normal
temperatures are predicted from the Southern Plains to the Southeast, along a
mean frontal boundary, with above-normal temperature odds ahead of the mean
front in the Florida Peninsula, southern Louisiana, and southern Texas.

Increased onshore flow over northern Mainland Alaska favors a
wetter-than-normal pattern. Farther south toward the southern Mainland Coast,
below-normal precipitation is predicted for the Southeast Mainland, eastern
Aleutians, and southeastern Panhandle, under the increased influence of the
Northeast Pacific ridge. The ridge over the Pacific Ocean also favors
increased
odds of below-normal precipitation across much of the West Coast, extending
into the Great Basin and eastward to the Front Range. However, increased
mid-level troughing over the western CONUS increases southerly flow across the
Great Plains, tilting odds toward above-normal precipitation there, with
enhanced odds across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Frontal activity
across the Southern Tier favors above-normal precipitation across the
Southeast. In parts of the Great Lakes into the Northeast, drier-than-normal
conditions are favored, associated with mean surface high pressure.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
agreement in synoptic-scale features and patterns, offset by differences in
magnitudes of these features and some differences among the model temperature
and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Major Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high temperature
records into the weekend...

...Tropical moisture brings a heavy rain threats to the Southeast
and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Overview...

Deterministic guidance maintains good agreement and continuity for
the overall pattern of a rather amplified ridge drifting east
across the West Coast and a deep low over lifting north from
Hudson Bay Thursday through Saturday. There are then some timing
and strength differences for the next through entering the Pacific
Northwest/BC on Sunday into Monday. A tropical wave approaches
Florida or the eastern Gulf of Mexico this weekend with preceding
tropical moisture reaching into the Mid-Atlantic. The strong
ridging over the West will support an extreme heat wave that
affects the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin/California into
or through the weekend with temperatures over some areas expected
to reach or exceed daily records for both highs and especially
warm lows. Across the eastern third of the country, associated
fronts and leading warm/moist flow will produce areas of rain and
thunderstorms, some locally heavy at times, particularly ahead of
an approaching cold front and any tropical low center that
develops.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Acceptable agreement with the 00Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET and 06Z GFS was
sufficient to allow a simple blend of these through Day 5. The GFS
continues to be much more amplified with the next wave into BC
Saturday into Sunday which draws a low off the Pacific Northwest
inland while the ECMWF/CMC leave a low offshore. Based on this
difference and related downstream differences, went heavier toward
a GEFS/ECENS mean blend for Days 6 and 7. Regarding a tropical
wave approaching the CONUS from the Antilles this weekend, there
is decent agreement to having a cyclone develop and track toward
FL or the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The Northwest heat wave should produce several days with max/min
temperatures of 10-20F above normal across the Pacific Northwest
through Saturday night. Anomalies for daytime highs should be the
greatest around Thursday/Friday when a few locations, perhaps
centered over Portland, OR could reach 20-25F above normal. Dozens
of locations across the Northwest and into northern CA/NV should
see readings reach/exceed daily records for high max and mins. By
Sunday and Monday the highs may moderate somewhat as the ridge
gets eroded by incoming shortwave energy, but morning lows should
remain quite warm. Currently expect this heat wave to be less
extreme than the all-time record event in late June but still be
of major significance for the Portland-Seattle corridor.

As the upper ridge axis shifts east, monsoon activity over the
Desert Southwest should increase again which brings a localized
flash flood risk. The current guidance consensus indicates Arizona
as the main threat area.

A cold front pushes southeast from the northern Plains/Great Lakes
Thursday night, reaching the East Coast and Southeast this
weekend, will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms over the
eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period. Some
areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely, particularly
Saturday as tropical moisture meets the front from the central
Appalachians to the TN Valley and then east to the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast on Sunday. Farther ahead of the front, daily
scattered storm chances will also exist over the East and Deep
South within a warm and moist environment. Florida sees rainfall
increase Friday into the weekend due to a tropical wave/surface
low and some upper level energy moving into the area from the
Bahamas/Cuba. The National Hurricane Center continues to monitor
this system for further tropical development in the next few days.

Very warm to hot conditions prevail to the east and south of the
cold front through Friday. The highest anomalies of plus 10-15F
are most likely for morning lows from the Great Lakes into the
Northeast Thursday night-Friday night with several more daily
records possible Friday morning. The combined heat and humidity
should support heat index values into at least the low 100s for
many lower elevations on Friday from the Mid-Atlantic to eastern
TX. High heat index values are suppressed by the cold front
Saturday and Sunday to over the lower Mississippi Valley along
with areas along and inland from the Gulf Coast.

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible in the Midwest and Great
Lakes through Tuesday; severe weather returns to the Northern
Plains today...

...Above average heat and humidity to remain across portions of
the Southern Plains into the Midwest, while temperatures climb
across the Pacific Northwest...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke will remain out West
into parts of the Central Plains and Midwest...

Severe thunderstorms and possible flash flooding will impact
portions of the Northern Plains and Midwest through tonight near a
pair of frontal boundaries in the area. Anomalously high
temperatures combined with dewpoints that are well in the 70s were
in place along and to the south/east of these frontal boundaries
supporting heat indices between 100 and 110 degrees. Heat
Advisories were in effect for eastern portions of the Central and
Southern Plains to just across the Mississippi River. A front
extending from the Great Lakes region into the Central Plains on
Tuesday will support additional potential for severe thunderstorms
and flash flooding, with the focus for severe storms setting up in
the vicinity of eastern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and northern
Illinois where the Storm Prediction Center is highlighting an
Enhanced Risk for severe thunderstorms on Tuesday. Heat indices on
Tuesday may breach 110 degrees across eastern Kansas into the
Upper Midwest.

The upper level pattern will evolve through mid-week such that the
front over the Great Lakes to Central Plains will lose definition
while another cold front drops down from Canada into the
north-central U.S. Tuesday evening into Wednesday. The pattern
will favor wildfire smoke from the western U.S. to advance
downstream into the Central Plains and Midwest, resulting in
reduced air quality through at least Tuesday evening.

Across the northwestern U.S., high temperatures are forecast to
climb through Wednesday with highs nearing 100 degrees in Portland
on Wednesday. Excessive Heat Watches are in place from northern
California into western Oregon and much of Washington in
expectations of the heat wave to begin during the middle of the
week, and likely peaking for the latter half of this week.

...Major Northwest heat wave to challenge daily high temperature
records into the weekend...

...Potential Tropical Cyclone Six brings heavy rain threats to the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic this weekend...

...Overview...

The guidance continues to show a strong upper level ridge building
over the Western U.S. while deep troughing lifts from the Great
Lakes into the Northeast through next weekend. The strong ridge
over the West will support another dangerous heat wave with
temperatures over some areas expected to reach or exceed daily
records for both highs and especially warm lows. By early next
week, the pattern may flip as amplified troughing/possible closed
low enters the West Coast and ridging builds over the Eastern
U.S.. Additionally, NHC continues to monitor Potential Tropical
Cyclone Six which may approach Florida as a tropical storm this
weekend bringing heavy rainfall to Florida and eventually parts of
the Southeast.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

There is fairly good agreement regarding trough details across the
Great Lakes into the Northeast early period, though the 18z GFS
remains on the faster side of continuity. Prefer a blend towards
the ECMWF/UKMET/CMC which is also more in line with the ensemble
means. Out west, the ridge should break down by Sunday as
amplified troughing moves ashore. Guidance struggles late in the
period with possible upper low formation across the Northwest but
may be trending towards at least a more amplified trough. The GFS
has been most consistent with showing some sort of upper feature
the past couple of runs. The WPC blend trends towards the ensemble
means days 6-7, with some inclusion of the ECMWF and GFS for added
system definition. Guidance has also come into better agreement
regarding Potential Tropical Cyclone Six and its eventual track
towards the U.S.. Most models agree it may graze southern FL as it
moves into the eastern Gulf, but struggle with timing (ECMWF
fastest, CMC/GFS slower). Please refer to the guidance from NHC
regarding the details and official forecast track of Potential
Tropical Cyclone Six.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave across the Northwest will continue into Friday and
Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-20+ above normal likely
to reach or exceed daily records both for high temperatures and
warm overnight lows. Friday should be the warmest with
temperatures slightly cooler (though still much above normal) for
Saturday. This heat wave should be relatively short lived and less
extreme compared to the all-time record event in late June, but
still of major significance for the Portland-Seattle corridor. By
early next week, temperatures should rebound below normal across
the Northwest as upper level troughing enters the region.

Elsewhere, as the upper ridge axis shifts east, monsoon activity
over the Desert Southwest should increase again bringing a
localized flash flood risk. A cold front pushing southeast from
Great Lakes on Friday, should reach the East Coast and Southeast
this weekend. This will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms
over the eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period.
Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely, but exact
amounts and locations are still very uncertain at this time and
may take until the short range period to resolve. Farther south,
daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the Deep South
within a warm and moist environment. Florida should see rainfall
increase Friday into the weekend due to Potential Tropical Cyclone
Six (which may be a tropical storm by then). Regardless of
development, heavy rainfall across Florida is likely, with
tropical moisture tracking into the Southeast and southern/central
Appalachians early next week.

Much above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic on Friday prior to the frontal passage, with hot
weather also extending into the Southern states. Combined heat and
humidity should support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many, on Friday, with the cold front likely to suppress
the heat to the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the
central and western Gulf this coming weekend. Across the Northern
and Central Plains, temperatures should be near or a few degrees
on either side of normal through much of the extended range
period.

The heat wave across the Northwest will continue into Friday and
Saturday with max/min temperatures of 10-20+ above normal likely
to reach or exceed daily records both for high temperatures and
warm overnight lows. Friday should be the warmest with
temperatures slightly cooler (though still much above normal) for
Saturday. This heat wave should be relatively short lived and less
extreme compared to the all-time record event in late June, but
still of major significance for the Portland-Seattle corridor. By
early next week, temperatures should rebound below normal across
the Northwest as upper level troughing enters the region.

Elsewhere, as the upper ridge axis shifts east, monsoon activity
over the Desert Southwest should increase again bringing a
localized flash flood risk. A cold front pushing southeast from
Great Lakes on Friday, should reach the East Coast and Southeast
this weekend. This will focus areas of showers and thunderstorms
over the eastern third to half of the lower 48 during the period.
Some areas of locally moderate to heavy rain are likely, but exact
amounts and locations are still very uncertain at this time and
may take until the short range period to resolve. Farther south,
daily scattered storm chances will also exist over the Deep South
within a warm and moist environment. Florida should see rainfall
increase Friday into the weekend due to Potential Tropical Cyclone
Six (which may be a tropical storm by then). Regardless of
development, heavy rainfall across Florida is likely, with
tropical moisture tracking into the Southeast and southern/central
Appalachians early next week.

Much above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic on Friday prior to the frontal passage, with hot
weather also extending into the Southern states. Combined heat and
humidity should support heat index values into at least the low
100s for many, on Friday, with the cold front likely to suppress
the heat to the lower Mississippi Valley and areas along the
central and western Gulf this coming weekend. Across the Northern
and Central Plains, temperatures should be near or a few degrees
on either side of normal through much of the extended range
period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough over the northern US will lift to the northeast
as a second trough moves south out of Canada. As the two systems
merge, broad cyclonic flow will expand over the northern Plains and
upper Midwest through the day. At the surface, a cold front will
stall across the upper Mississippi Valley while a second stronger
front approaches from southern Canada.

...Montana and Wyoming into the western Dakotas...
In the wake of the stalled front across the Midwest, west to east
pressure gradients will persist across the northern and central
Rockies. Broad mid-level westerly flow will enhance westerly surface
winds to 15-20 mph through the afternoon. Downslope drying and
strong heating through the day should support widespread surface RH
below 25%. The combination of gusty winds and dry fuels will allow a
broad swath of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
to develop from southern Montana into the western Dakotas and
northern Wyoming.

Farther south, locally elevated fire weather conditions appear
likely over southern Wyoming. Displaced from the stronger flow
aloft, westerly winds of 15-20 mph will overlap with surface RH
below 20%. Enhancement from surrounding terrain may support some
stronger gusts through the afternoon. However, low fuel density and
wetter conditions in the areas of more receptive fuels will preclude
any additional delineations.

...Southern Nevada...
Scattered thunderstorms are forecast to develop with a surge of
moisture and weak upper level disturbance moving across the Desert
Southwest. Regional model soundings show PWAT values of 0.8 to 1.2
inches advancing northward across southern Nevada through the day.
While weak upper-level flow and the high PWAT airmass suggests
storms will be mostly wet, isolated lightning strikes may pose a
risk for a few ignitions or hold overs.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Tue Aug 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow across the northern US will continue as weak
ridging builds across the southern half of the CONUS. Strong
northwesterly flow will develop behind a cold front moving south out
of Canada, while a surge of moisture across the Great Basin will
support thunderstorms and dry lightning potential

...Thunderstorms western Great Basin and Sierra...
Thunderstorm chances are expected to increase as the nose of a surge
of monsoon moisture lifts northward Day2/Wednesday. Model soundings
show PWAT values of 0.5 to 0.7 inches atop a well-mixed boundary
layer across portions of the western Great Basin and Sierra. Hi-res
model guidance differs on how far north the deeper moisture and
developing thunderstorms will reach, casting uncertainty on the
spatial distribution of any dry lightning threat. The greatest
potential for lightning will remain across the southern/central
Sierra where sufficient moisture and lift appear to be the most
correlated. Given the uncertainty, dry thunder probabilities will be
withheld until greater model agreement is reached.

...Eastern Montana and the western Dakotas...
Behind the southward moving cold front, a more humid and slightly
cooler airmass is expected to develop across much of the northern
Plains. Northwest surface winds of 20-25 mph will be bolstered by
the broad mid-level westerlies associated with the trough over the
northern US. Model guidance suggest surface RH values below 30% will
be likely in combination with the strong winds. This would favor
locally elevated fire weather conditions across much of Montana and
the western Dakotas where fuels are mostly dry. Should model
guidance trend drier, elevated highlights may be considered.

355 AM EDT Tue Aug 10 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Aug 10 2021 - 12Z Thu Aug 12 2021

...Heavy rain and severe storms possible in the Midwest and Great
Lakes; severe weather also possible into the Mid-Atlantic...

...Sultry conditions to persist across portions of the Southern
Plains into the Midwest, excessively hot temperatures take shape
across the Pacific Northwest...

...Poor air quality due to wildfire smoke continues in the western
and central U.S., monsoon showers and storms to drench parts of
the Southwest...

The Midwest and Great Lakes remain in the spotlight for more
episodes of severe weather over the next couple days. An area of
low pressure will continue to keep these regions in a favorable
position for sever storms that could produce damaging winds, large
hail, and tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center has a large
Slight Risk area that extends from the Central Plains to the
central Great Lakes. In the middle of the Slight Risk is an
Enhanced Area centered over southern Wisconsin, northern Illinois,
and northeast Iowa where the highest potential for damaging winds
is anticipated. The same general locations are once again at risk
for severe weather on Wednesday. Farther east, strong-to-severe
storms are also on tap for parts of the eastern Great Lakes, the
Ohio Valley, and northern Mid-Atlantic later today and Wednesday.
In all of there aforementioned areas, heavy rainfall is possible
in addition to the severe weather with areas of flash flooding are
also possible.

Much of the Lower 48 will be mired in abnormally hot conditions
through mid-week. Heat Advisories have been issued from the
central Plains and Mississippi Valley to the Lower Great Lakes and
the Northeast In addition, Excessive Heat Watches and/or Warnings
are in effect for parts of the Pacific Northwest and in the
Delaware Valley. High temps are forecast to soar towards the
century mark in the Willamette Valley on Wednesday. Daytime lows
will be quite warm along the West Coast and east of the
Mississippi River where numerous record warm minimum temperatures
are possible on Wednesday and Thursday mornings. The heat wave in
the Northwest looks to peak during the second half of the week.

Elsewhere, the evolving upper level pattern will favor wildfire
smoke from the western U.S. to advance downstream into the Central
Plains and Midwest, resulting in reduced air quality through
today. Smoke refuses to let up from northern California to the
central Rockies and High Plains through mid-week. Also, monsoon
showers and thunderstorms will be a daily occurrence in the Desert
Southwest. A Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall has been posted
for parts of the region both Tuesday and Wednesday.

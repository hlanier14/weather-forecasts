.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Tue Apr 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent upper low observed by regional IR/WV imagery early this
morning is currently undergoing rapid deepening across the Central
Rockies. Forecast to rapidly eject eastward onto the Plains by early
afternoon, this trough and an accompanying 80-90 kt jet streak will
support further intensification of an already strong lee low and
surface wind field across the southern/central Plains. A dryline
trailing the low will bisect a broad warm sector as it mixes east
through the afternoon leaving very dry surface conditions in its
wake. A rare combination of exceptionally dry fuels and high-end
meteorological parameter space lends strong confidence in Extremely
Critical fire weather conditions and the possibility of a
significant wildfire event across the southern/central High Plains.

*An outbreak of dangerous wildfire conditions is likely across the
southern and central high Plains Today!*

...West Texas through western Oklahoma and into Kansas...
Latest NWP timing guidance has firmed up solutions on the ejection
of the primary upper trough and associated jet streak across the
Plains. The mid-level system, slightly slower than previous
guidance, should begin to move out over the southern and central
High Plains by mid morning. As strong ascent overspreads the High
Plains, the lee low should continue to deepen peaking below 990 mb
across western NE before quickly moving northeast into the upper
Midwest by tonight. With strong surface pressure falls and the
emergence of the mid and low-level jet, strong surface winds of
30-45 mph and 55+ mph gusts should quickly develop in the southwest
quadrant of the low coincident with the low-level thermal ridge.
Subsidence/mixing beneath the jet, downslope trajectories and
surface temperatures climbing into the 90s F should rapidly decrease
surface RH within the corridor of maximum winds through the
afternoon. By peak heating, surface RH in the mid single digits will
be possible within the broader area of RH less than 10% across the
southern/central High Plains. Peak fire weather conditions are
expected from roughly 18-23z across a southwest to northeast
corridor from western TX through the Panhandles and western OK into
western/central KS where hi-res guidance shows Fosberg index values
over 90.

Some uncertainty exists in the eastern extent of Critical and
Extremely Critical conditions based on model differences with
respect to the dryline. While a tight gradient will exist, strong
winds within the surface pressure trough in the vicinity of the
dryline will likely support Elevated and Critical fire weather
potential. Another concern will be the presence of a fast moving
cold front expected to travel southeast across the Critical area
near sunset. Strong winds along the front as well as a prominent
wind shift to the north/northwest may impact fire direction and
spread rates despite cooling temperatures and slow rising RH.

...Central High Plains...
To the west of the main risk corridor, strong downslope winds are
expected in the wake of the aforementioned cold front. While
uncertainty remains high with respect to surface RH conditions
behind the cooler airmass across western NE and SD, at least a few
hours of very strong northwesterly winds may align with relatively
dry surface conditions amid dry fuels. The Elevated area was
expanded westward to account for at least some fire weather
potential given the magnitude of low-level flow near the strong
surface low.

Across much of the southern/central Plains, fuels states are
exceptionally volatile. ERC values in the 90-95th percentile are
ubiquitous across the southern High Plains with lesser, but still
very dry conditions extending farther north into the central High
Plains. Severe drought, several antecedent days of Critical drying
and numerous reports of large fires over the preceding days shows
fuel beds are extremely receptive to fire starts and spreads. High
confidence exists in several hours of Extremely Critical fire
weather conditions developing beneath the low-level jet core and
thermal ridge axis from west TX, through the Panhandles, western OK,
and into western KS. The overlap of rare meteorological and fuel
parameter space matches well with several Great Plains wildfire
outbreak analogs giving further confidence in significant potential
for a widespread and high-end fire weather outbreak.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 12 2022

SYNOPSIS: Following a brief period of anomalous cold at the beginning of
week-2, temperatures are expected to moderate across the central and eastern
U.S. Mid-level low pressure is forecast to shift inland from the northeastern
Pacific to the western U.S. during late April. This evolving pattern increases
the chances of high winds from the West Coast east to the Great Plains, late
season snowfall at the higher elevations of the West, and eventually heavy
precipitation across the central U.S.



HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys, Central to Southern Appalachians, and parts of the Mid-Atlantic.,
Wed,
Apr 20.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for parts of the central and
eastern U.S., Wed-Thu, Apr 20-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Pacific Northwest and
northern California, Wed-Sun, Apr 20-24.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the Cascades, Wed-Sun, Apr 20-24.

Slight risk of high winds expanding east from the West Coast to the Great
Plains, Wed-Sun, Apr 20-24.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Great Plains and
Mississippi Valley, Sun-Tue, Apr 24-26.

Flooding possible along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of the
North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 15 - TUESDAY APRIL 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!uS6yDZRV0Xw9N3V_QketnEusRa_uLLDcnYrcgmWcB8d2-S-m9vWkeaz-wW0y1R8P4MIQmJaC$

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 20 - TUESDAY APRIL 26: During the early to middle part of
next week, model solutions remain consistent that surface high pressure is
forecast to shift southeastward from the Northern Great Plains to the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Much below-normal temperatures are expected to
time
off by day 8 (Apr 20) across the Great Plains with the focus for anomalous
cold
becoming centered over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, Mid-Atlantic, and
Southeast. A moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures is posted only on
Apr 20 for areas where reforecast tools depict minimum temperatures having a
40
percent chance of falling into the lowest 15th percentile and there is an
increased risk of a freeze or frost. The ECMWF is more bullish with anomalous
cold, with the Ohio Valley and Central to Southern Appalachians having more
than a 60 percent chance of experiencing a freeze on April 20. A slight risk
of
much below normal temperatures extends through April 21, but model solutions
have trended towards a faster moderation in temperatures.



Typhoon Malakas, currently east of the Philippines, is forecast to recurve
northeastward across the North Pacific during the next week. Model solutions
are in good agreement that the remnant low of this tropical cyclone
contributes
to a strengthening of the 500-hPa trough over the northeast Pacific. A slight
risk of heavy precipitation (Apr 20-24) is maintained for the Pacific
Northwest
and was expanded south to include parts of northern California, based on the
500-hPa pattern and reforecast precipitation tools. Given the predicted
thermal
profiles, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted for the Cascades. Accumulating
snow is also expected to overspread the higher elevations of the Northern to
Central Rockies, but uncertainty on amounts preclude designation of a snow
hazard at this time. As the 500-hPa trough axis shifts eastward during week-2,
there is an increased risk of high winds throughout much of the West and
eventually the Great Plains. Any enhancement of surface winds across the
Southwest and Great Plains is likely to result in elevated wildfire danger due
to the ongoing drought conditions. Downstream of the trough, the potential for
thunderstorms with locally heavy rain is expected to increase later in week-2.
Based on signs of returning low-level moisture from the Gulf of Mexico and
good
model agreement on a 500-hPa trough axis shifting east towards the central
U.S., a slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of the Great
Plains and Mississippi Valley from Apr 24-26. Since the storm track across the
North Pacific is shifting south and east by week-2, the slight risk of high
winds and heavy precipitation are discontinued for the Alaska Panhandle.



Spring flooding continues along parts of the Illinois River and Red River of
the North. Moderate to heavy rain is forecast across the Midwest during the
next week, while heavy snow and rain are forecast throughout the Dakotas and
Minnesota. Based on the above-normal precipitation likely preceding week-2 and
forecasts from the Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, a flooding possible
hazard is maintained for the Illinois River and Red River of the North through
week-2.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 PM CDT Tue Apr 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The primary change to the outlook was to expand the Critical area
into southeast Colorado. Winds of 20-30 mph and 5-15% RH will occur
for a few hours tomorrow. Temperatures will be a bit cool, but
exceptionally dry fuels should still be receptive to fire spread
given the meteorological conditions.

The forecast in parts of Kansas/Nebraska remains somewhat
complicated. Temperatures will be a bit cooler in some locations
along with possible cloud cover. However, where heating can occur,
the airmass will be very dry and winds are expected to be strong.
With meteorological conditions expected to be near Critical,
highlights have been expanded into these areas.

..Wendt.. 04/12/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Tue Apr 12 2022/

...Synopsis...
As the powerful mid-level cyclone shifts northeastward through Day
1/Tuesday, mid-level flow will turn northwesterly and accelerate
over the Southwest and Southern High Plains. Despite cooling
temperatures, very strong wind fields and very low humidity are
expected to develop support a second day of widespread Critical fire
weather conditions within receptive fuels.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
With the mid-level jet turning more westerly with time behind the
departing upper low across the Midwest, strong west/northwesterly
flow will continue to overspread the southern Rockies and High
Plains. Strong downslope winds are expected from eastern NM into the
western TX Panhandle Wednesday afternoon and evening. With strong
subsidence and downsloping, extremely dry surface conditions appear
likely to develop with model soundings showing mean mixed-layer RH
values as low as 2-3%. Extremely dry fuels remain in place
supporting high confidence in dangerous fire weather conditions.

Lesser confidence exists in the potential for sustained Extremely
Critical conditions across portions of eastern NM and the
southwestern TX Panhandle. The primary concerns revolve around
duration of the stronger winds as a cooler boundary-layer and cold
front may limit any Extremely Critical Conditions. Offset from the
brunt of diurnal heating, overlap appears to be small casting
significant uncertainty. However, fuel states remain exceptionally
favorable for fire spreads/starts supporting at least the potential
for an upgrade to Extremely critical in subsequent outlooks.

...Central High Plains...
In the wake of the earlier cold front, dry and windy conditions
should develop for a few hours across the central High Plains and
lee of the Rockies. The potential for light precipitation from Day 1
is not expected to hamper extremely dry fuels in place across the
region. While surface temperatures should be cool in the
post-frontal airmass, low relative humidity and gusty winds should
support Elevated fire weather potential for a few hours before the
arrival of cooler temperatures and higher humidity overnight.

Extended Forecast Discussion

259 PM EDT Tue Apr 12 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 15 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 19 2022


...Overview...

Lower amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the lower 48
at least from Friday through the weekend, behind a departing deep
upper low which may take its time drifting across eastern Canada
into next week. Guidance generally shows a shortwave and
associated rain/snow progressing into and through the West during
the weekend then into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next
week. By early next week an upper trough reaching the eastern
Pacific early next week may serve to amplify the downstream ridge
crossing the West and trough heading into the East, with the
Pacific trough likely entering the West next Tuesday and bringing
another episode of precipitation to the region. Within what has
been an agreeable forecast of the large scale pattern, persistent
significant detail differences at the surface and aloft keep
confidence lower than desired for coverage and intensity of
precipitation--especially over the eastern half of the country
from Sunday onward but also to some degree over the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the period started with a composite of latest
operational runs. This part of the forecast involved primarily
timing issues, with the GFS beginning to stray a bit faster than
most other guidance for the surface front and supporting dynamics
crossing New England during the weekend and spread/variability
persisting for the system reaching the West by Saturday. The
western system has some degree of complexity, involving potential
interaction of a trough/upper low off the Pacific
Northwest/Vancouver Island and separate shortwave just to the
south. Through the 06Z cycle the GFS was on the faster side of the
spread but the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted closer to the GFS,
leaving the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean a little on the slower side and
the 12Z CMC essentially a compromise. The new 12Z ECMWF has nudged
to a middle ground as well.

By the first part of next week, detail issues with the incoming
western system lead to additional divergence of solutions at the
surface and aloft over the East. The ECMWF through 00Z continued
to be the most consistent model in principle with development of
an embedded closed low along with surface system whose track is
over the mid-latitudes of the East, with its mean and the CMC/CMC
mean favoring similar timing which is slower than the GFS/GEFS
mean. The new 12Z GFS/CMC keep the core of the upper trough
farther north which leads to a much farther north surface low
track than what other guidance had been showing through the
00Z/06Z cycles. The 12Z GEFS mean has adjusted the surface track
at least partially in the 12Z GFS/CMC direction. Meanwhile the new
12Z UKMET becomes a fast extreme with greater strength than
consensus. The 12Z ECMWF has adjusted its upper system northward
somewhat but not to the extent of the GFS/CMC. The upper trough
reaching the West by Tuesday was closer to consensus in the 00Z
GFS versus the faster 06Z run, while the 12Z version has reverted
back to the majority. The new CMC/ECMWF are fairly consistent. The
early-period blend based on 00Z-06Z based guidance transitioned to
a model/mean mix tilted somewhat more toward the ECMWF/ECMWF mean
relative to the GFS/GEFS, with 06Z GFS input switching to the 00Z
run late.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes will
likely continue to bring gusty winds into Friday across the
northern tier, resulting in blowing a drifting of snow and
possible hazardous travel conditions in regions that received
heavy snowfall in prior days. This system may also produce some
generally light precipitation across the Great Lakes/Northeast.
Moisture and instability interacting with a warm front lifting
through the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley next weekend
and approach of a cold front from the north should bring areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but
for now with low confidence in exact placement of heaviest totals.
Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West by Saturday
should focus rain/mountain snow over the central and northern West
Coast into the northern Rockies late this week into the weekend.
Currently the best signal for heaviest totals is from southwest
Oregon into northern California but still with some uncertainty
over exact location and magnitude. Moisture should spread east
beyond the Rockies Sunday onward as low pressure/fronts reach the
central/eastern U.S. At least some precipitation across the
northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage. Expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies early next
week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern High
Plains will likely persist into early next week, with daytime
highs generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings
(especially for daytime highs) are possible late this week into
the weekend with some lingering daily records for lows/cold highs
possible mainly on Friday. Over the West, temperatures should
moderate in between systems as a period of upper ridging moves
through. Friday-Saturday will feature chilly readings over the
northern half of the region (minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and
closer to normal temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge
builds over the region by the start of next week, northern
locations should trend toward normal and southern areas above
normal. The Great Basin and Southwest could see highs as warm as
10-15F above normal. The East should stay near normal this
weekend, but the system potentially reaching the Midwest/East
early next week could draw some of the chilly northern Plains air
southward and eastward behind it, with expanding coverage of minus
10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains will see highs 10-15F above
normal Friday-Sunday followed by a cooling trend.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 12 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 18 - 22 2022

Today's model solutions are generally in good agreement on the overall
predicted large-scale 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America and
surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period. A trough and associated
negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over the northeast Pacific.
Downstream, a ridge is predicted with associated positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the southwestern CONUS expanding into the Central Rockies. A
mean trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over
the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely over parts of the northwestern ,central,
and eastern CONUS under predicted below normal 500-hPa heights and enhanced
northerly mid-level flow. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for
most of the southwestern CONUS northward into parts of the Great Basin and
Central Rockies, as a ridge is predicted to push into the region during the
period. Near to below normal temperatures are likely over most of Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle underneath predicted near to below normal
500-hPa heights, while above normal temperatures are favored over parts of
southwestern Alaska, due to forecast low-level southerly flow.

Above normal precipitation is favored for much of the eastern CONUS, near and
ahead of  the predicted mean trough over eastern North America. Near to below
normal precipitation is favored over much of the southwestern CONUS, Great
Plains, and parts of the western Great Lakes, consistent with the reforecast
tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the northwestern
CONUS,
ahead of predicted trough over the northeastern Pacific. Above normal
precipitation is elevated for the Rio Grande Valley, supported by the
consolidation forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored
across the southern Alaska Panhandle, while near to below normal precipitation
is most likely over the remainder of Alaska, supported by the precipitation
dynamical forecast tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and among
the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due to a
changing pattern.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 20 - 26 2022

During the 8-14 day period, the circulation pattern over the North American
region is generally consistent with an evolution of the predicted pattern for
the 6-10 day period, with increased uncertainty. A trough is predicted to
de-amplify over the northeastern Pacific, while the downstream ridge and
trough
are predicted to progress eastward over the CONUS. The 500-hPa circulation
pattern indicates negative 500-hPa height anomalies over Alaska and parts of
the Pacific Northwest and near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast
over the remainder of the CONUS.

Near to above normal temperatures are likely for much of the southwestern
CONUS
and the central and southern Plains, under near to above normal 500-hPa
heights. Below normal temperatures are favored for the northwestern CONUS,
associated with predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Below
normal temperatures are favored for much of the eastern CONUS, due to
predicted
troughing early in the period. Elevated probabilities of below normal
temperatures are forecast for much of Alaska, supported by the dynamical model
temperature tools.

Above normal precipitation is favored for much of the northwestern CONUS
eastward to the Northern and Central Plains and parts of the Great Lakes
region, due to several predicted short wave systems affecting these regions
during the period. Near to below normal precipitation is favored over parts of
the southwestern CONUS, consistent with the precipitation dynamical model
tools. Above normal precipitation is likely across the Alaska Panhandle, while
near to below normal precipitation is favored for the remainder of Alaska,
supported by the precipitation consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
only fair agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and
among the temperature and precipitation tools, in addition to uncertainty due
to a changing pattern.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Major winter storm to bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions
to parts of the Northern Plains through Thursday...

...Significant severe weather as well as some flash flooding
possible Wednesday from the Lower Mississippi Valley north to the
Midwest...

...Dangerous fire weather conditions for the Southern/Central High
Plains...

...Lower elevation coastal rain and thunderstorms as well as
higher elevation and interior snow continue from the Pacific
Northwest to the Rockies...

A powerful low pressure system moving through the Plains today and
the Midwest on Wednesday continues to produce widespread
significant impacts across the central U.S. including a blizzard,
severe weather, flash flooding, and the risk for wildfires. Snow
has already begun to fall to the northwest of the system across
the Northern Plains where record snowfall and extreme storm
impacts are forecast. Storm total snowfall between 1-2 feet is
expected from eastern Montana into western and northern North
Dakota, and locally as high as 2-3 feet. In addition, gusty winds
as high as 50 mph will create blizzard conditions centered across
western and northern North Dakota, where a Blizzard Warning is in
effect through Thursday evening. Travel will be very difficult to
impossible and there is the potential for power outages and tree
damage. Significant impacts to young livestock are also possible.
As the system continues to the northeast, the snow will expand
across the Upper Midwest Thursday, with significant snowfall
looking possible for portions of northern Minnesota as well.

In the warm sector of the system, a widespread, significant severe
weather outbreak is expected from the Lower Mississippi Valley
northward through the Lower Ohio Valley and Midwest. This includes
the risk for strong tornadoes, particularly for portions of the
Lower Mississippi Valley from Memphis south to northern Louisiana.
Widespread damaging winds are also likely with lines of storms
forming along an eastward moving cold front as well as large hail.
In addition, there is a Slight Risk for heavy rain and possible
flash flooding over the same region as storms both ahead of and
along the cold front will have the potential to produce
significant downpours. Storms along the cold front will also
likely pass over areas that see heavy rain from storms ahead of
the front both today and tomorrow, leading to higher rain totals.
To the west, very low humidity combined with widespread sustained
winds of 20-30 mph as the cold front passes southward have
prompted a Critical Risk for fire weather conditions from the
Storm Prediction Center for portions of the Central and Southern
High Plains Wednesday. A lower, but still notable risk will be in
place for Thursday as a lee trough remains in place east of the
Rockies.

Meanwhile, snow showers will continue to linger through the end of
the forecast period (Thursday evening) along a meandering
stationary front trailing to the west of the central U.S. system
through the Central/Northern Rockies and into the Pacific
Northwest. Rain and thunderstorms will also continue for lower
elevations of the Pacific Northwest and northern California as a
trough of low pressure remains in place along the coast through
Wednesday and another storm system approaches the region on
Thursday.

Temperatures are forecast to remain cool across the western U.S.
(15 to 30 degrees below average) through Thursday while warm
southerly flow will transport well above average temperatures into
the central and eastern U.S. ahead of the central U.S. system.
High temperatures will range from the 90s in southern Texas to the
80s from the Southern Plains through the Southeast and as far
north as the Mid-Atlantic.

...Overview...

Lower amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the lower 48
at least from Friday through the weekend, behind a departing deep
upper low which may take its time drifting across eastern Canada
into next week. Guidance generally shows a shortwave and
associated rain/snow progressing into and through the West during
the weekend then into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next
week. By early next week an upper trough reaching the eastern
Pacific early next week may serve to amplify the downstream ridge
crossing the West and trough heading into the East, with the
Pacific trough likely entering the West next Tuesday and bringing
another episode of precipitation to the region. Within what has
been an agreeable forecast of the large scale pattern, persistent
significant detail differences at the surface and aloft keep
confidence lower than desired for coverage and intensity of
precipitation--especially over the eastern half of the country
from Sunday onward but also to some degree over the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the period started with a composite of latest
operational runs. This part of the forecast involved primarily
timing issues, with the GFS beginning to stray a bit faster than
most other guidance for the surface front and supporting dynamics
crossing New England during the weekend and spread/variability
persisting for the system reaching the West by Saturday. The
western system has some degree of complexity, involving potential
interaction of a trough/upper low off the Pacific
Northwest/Vancouver Island and separate shortwave just to the
south. Through the 06Z cycle the GFS was on the faster side of the
spread but the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted closer to the GFS,
leaving the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean a little on the slower side and
the 12Z CMC essentially a compromise. The new 12Z ECMWF has nudged
to a middle ground as well.

By the first part of next week, detail issues with the incoming
western system lead to additional divergence of solutions at the
surface and aloft over the East. The ECMWF through 00Z continued
to be the most consistent model in principle with development of
an embedded closed low along with surface system whose track is
over the mid-latitudes of the East, with its mean and the CMC/CMC
mean favoring similar timing which is slower than the GFS/GEFS
mean. The new 12Z GFS/CMC keep the core of the upper trough
farther north which leads to a much farther north surface low
track than what other guidance had been showing through the
00Z/06Z cycles. The 12Z GEFS mean has adjusted the surface track
at least partially in the 12Z GFS/CMC direction. Meanwhile the new
12Z UKMET becomes a fast extreme with greater strength than
consensus. The 12Z ECMWF has adjusted its upper system northward
somewhat but not to the extent of the GFS/CMC. The upper trough
reaching the West by Tuesday was closer to consensus in the 00Z
GFS versus the faster 06Z run, while the 12Z version has reverted
back to the majority. The new CMC/ECMWF are fairly consistent. The
early-period blend based on 00Z-06Z based guidance transitioned to
a model/mean mix tilted somewhat more toward the ECMWF/ECMWF mean
relative to the GFS/GEFS, with 06Z GFS input switching to the 00Z
run late.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes will
likely continue to bring gusty winds into Friday across the
northern tier, resulting in blowing a drifting of snow and
possible hazardous travel conditions in regions that received
heavy snowfall in prior days. This system may also produce some
generally light precipitation across the Great Lakes/Northeast.
Moisture and instability interacting with a warm front lifting
through the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley next weekend
and approach of a cold front from the north should bring areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but
for now with low confidence in exact placement of heaviest totals.
Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West by Saturday
should focus rain/mountain snow over the central and northern West
Coast into the northern Rockies late this week into the weekend.
Currently the best signal for heaviest totals is from southwest
Oregon into northern California but still with some uncertainty
over exact location and magnitude. Moisture should spread east
beyond the Rockies Sunday onward as low pressure/fronts reach the
central/eastern U.S. At least some precipitation across the
northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage. Expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies early next
week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern High
Plains will likely persist into early next week, with daytime
highs generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings
(especially for daytime highs) are possible late this week into
the weekend with some lingering daily records for lows/cold highs
possible mainly on Friday. Over the West, temperatures should
moderate in between systems as a period of upper ridging moves
through. Friday-Saturday will feature chilly readings over the
northern half of the region (minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and
closer to normal temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge
builds over the region by the start of next week, northern
locations should trend toward normal and southern areas above
normal. The Great Basin and Southwest could see highs as warm as
10-15F above normal. The East should stay near normal this
weekend, but the system potentially reaching the Midwest/East
early next week could draw some of the chilly northern Plains air
southward and eastward behind it, with expanding coverage of minus
10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains will see highs 10-15F above
normal Friday-Sunday followed by a cooling trend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
435 PM EDT Tue Apr 12 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 15 2022 - 12Z Tue Apr 19 2022


...Overview...

Lower amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the lower 48
at least from Friday through the weekend, behind a departing deep
upper low which may take its time drifting across eastern Canada
into next week. Guidance generally shows a shortwave and
associated rain/snow progressing into and through the West during
the weekend then into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next
week. By early next week an upper trough reaching the eastern
Pacific early next week may serve to amplify the downstream ridge
crossing the West and trough heading into the East, with the
Pacific trough likely entering the West next Tuesday and bringing
another episode of precipitation to the region. Within what has
been an agreeable forecast of the large scale pattern, persistent
significant detail differences at the surface and aloft keep
confidence lower than desired for coverage and intensity of
precipitation--especially over the eastern half of the country
from Sunday onward but also to some degree over the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the period started with a composite of latest
operational runs. This part of the forecast involved primarily
timing issues, with the GFS beginning to stray a bit faster than
most other guidance for the surface front and supporting dynamics
crossing New England during the weekend and spread/variability
persisting for the system reaching the West by Saturday. The
western system has some degree of complexity, involving potential
interaction of a trough/upper low off the Pacific
Northwest/Vancouver Island and separate shortwave just to the
south. Through the 06Z cycle the GFS was on the faster side of the
spread but the new 12Z UKMET has adjusted closer to the GFS,
leaving the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean a little on the slower side and
the 12Z CMC essentially a compromise. The new 12Z ECMWF has nudged
to a middle ground as well.

By the first part of next week, detail issues with the incoming
western system lead to additional divergence of solutions at the
surface and aloft over the East. The ECMWF through 00Z continued
to be the most consistent model in principle with development of
an embedded closed low along with surface system whose track is
over the mid-latitudes of the East, with its mean and the CMC/CMC
mean favoring similar timing which is slower than the GFS/GEFS
mean. The new 12Z GFS/CMC keep the core of the upper trough
farther north which leads to a much farther north surface low
track than what other guidance had been showing through the
00Z/06Z cycles. The 12Z GEFS mean has adjusted the surface track
at least partially in the 12Z GFS/CMC direction. Meanwhile the new
12Z UKMET becomes a fast extreme with greater strength than
consensus. The 12Z ECMWF has adjusted its upper system northward
somewhat but not to the extent of the GFS/CMC. The upper trough
reaching the West by Tuesday was closer to consensus in the 00Z
GFS versus the faster 06Z run, while the 12Z version has reverted
back to the majority. The new CMC/ECMWF are fairly consistent. The
early-period blend based on 00Z-06Z based guidance transitioned to
a model/mean mix tilted somewhat more toward the ECMWF/ECMWF mean
relative to the GFS/GEFS, with 06Z GFS input switching to the 00Z
run late.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes will
likely continue to bring gusty winds into Friday across the
northern tier, resulting in blowing a drifting of snow and
possible hazardous travel conditions in regions that received
heavy snowfall in prior days. This system may also produce some
generally light precipitation across the Great Lakes/Northeast.
Moisture and instability interacting with a warm front lifting
through the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley next weekend
and approach of a cold front from the north should bring areas of
moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of those areas, but
for now with low confidence in exact placement of heaviest totals.
Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West by Saturday
should focus rain/mountain snow over the central and northern West
Coast into the northern Rockies late this week into the weekend.
Currently the best signal for heaviest totals is from southwest
Oregon into northern California but still with some uncertainty
over exact location and magnitude. Moisture should spread east
beyond the Rockies Sunday onward as low pressure/fronts reach the
central/eastern U.S. At least some precipitation across the
northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage. Expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies early next
week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern High
Plains will likely persist into early next week, with daytime
highs generally 20-30F below normal. Locally colder readings
(especially for daytime highs) are possible late this week into
the weekend with some lingering daily records for lows/cold highs
possible mainly on Friday. Over the West, temperatures should
moderate in between systems as a period of upper ridging moves
through. Friday-Saturday will feature chilly readings over the
northern half of the region (minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and
closer to normal temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge
builds over the region by the start of next week, northern
locations should trend toward normal and southern areas above
normal. The Great Basin and Southwest could see highs as warm as
10-15F above normal. The East should stay near normal this
weekend, but the system potentially reaching the Midwest/East
early next week could draw some of the chilly northern Plains air
southward and eastward behind it, with expanding coverage of minus
10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains will see highs 10-15F above
normal Friday-Sunday followed by a cooling trend.

249 AM EDT Wed Apr 13 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 16 2022 - 12Z Wed Apr 20 2022


...Overview...

Lower amplitude mean flow aloft should prevail over the lower 48
at least through the weekend, behind a departing deep upper low
which may take its time drifting across eastern Canada into next
week. Guidance generally shows a shortwave and associated
rain/snow progressing into and through the West during the weekend
then into the Plains/Mississippi Valley by early next week.
Meanwhile, an upper trough reaching the eastern Pacific by Monday
may serve to amplify the overall flow with potential for a closed
low over the Great Lakes/Midwest around next Monday-Tuesday and
into the Northeast by Wednesday. Within what has been a decently
agreeable forecast of the large scale pattern, persistent
significant detail differences at the surface and aloft keep
confidence lower than desired for coverage and intensity of
precipitation--especially over the eastern half of the country
from Sunday onward but also to some degree over the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the period started with a composite of latest
operational runs. This part of the forecast involved primarily
timing issues, with the GFS beginning to stray a bit faster than
most other guidance for the surface front and supporting dynamics
crossing New England during the weekend. There's also some initial
spread/variability persisting for the system reaching the West by
Saturday. The western system has some degree of complexity,
involving potential interaction of a trough/upper low off the
Pacific Northwest/Vancouver Island and separate shortwave just to
the south. The 18z GFS and 12z UKMET both were faster than the
ECMWF and CMC. The UKMET is also the quickest/farthest south to
close off a low over the Ohio Valley and was not included in the
blend for tonight. By days 6-7, the ECMWF and the ECENS mean both
become noticeably slower with the upper system through the
Northeast, with the CMC continuing to be a nice middle ground
(along with the NAEFS mean). The new 00z runs actually look a
little more agreeable, with the GFS slowing a bit and the ECMWF a
little faster than the previous run. The 00z UKMET remains a
fast/south outlier. The next system enters the West Coast early
next week with again, the GFS a fast/stronger outlier and wanting
to close off an upper low over the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley next Wednesday. Prefer a blend towards the
slower ECMWF/CMC along with modest inclusion of the NAEFS/ECENS
ensemble means for the later periods.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes should
continue to produce some generally light to moderate precipitation
across the Great Lakes/Northeast as a secondary surface low lifts
off the coast. Moisture and instability interacting with a warm
front lifting through the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley
this weekend and approach of a cold front from the north should
bring areas of moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of
those areas, but for now with low confidence in exact placement of
heaviest totals. Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West
by Saturday should continue to focus rain/mountain snow over the
central and northern West Coast into the northern Rockies late
this week into the weekend. Moisture should spread east beyond the
Rockies Sunday onward as low pressure/fronts reach the
central/eastern U.S.. At least some precipitation across the
northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage. Expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies early next
week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern High
Plains will likely persist into early next week, with daytime
highs generally 20-30F below normal, and moderating slowly with
time. Over the West, temperatures should moderate in between
systems as a period of upper ridging moves through. Saturday will
feature chilly readings over the northern half of the region
(minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer to normal
temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge builds over the
region by the start of next week, northern locations should trend
toward normal and southern areas above normal. The Great Basin and
Southwest could see highs as warm as 10-15F above normal. The East
should stay near normal on Saturday, but the system potentially
reaching the Midwest/East early next week could draw some of the
chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it, with
expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains
will see highs 10-15F above normal next weekend followed by a
cooling trend.

from Sunday onward but also to some degree over the West.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The first half of the period started with a composite of latest
operational runs. This part of the forecast involved primarily
timing issues, with the GFS beginning to stray a bit faster than
most other guidance for the surface front and supporting dynamics
crossing New England during the weekend. There's also some initial
spread/variability persisting for the system reaching the West by
Saturday. The western system has some degree of complexity,
involving potential interaction of a trough/upper low off the
Pacific Northwest/Vancouver Island and separate shortwave just to
the south. The 18z GFS and 12z UKMET both were faster than the
ECMWF and CMC. The UKMET is also the quickest/farthest south to
close off a low over the Ohio Valley and was not included in the
blend for tonight. By days 6-7, the ECMWF and the ECENS mean both
become noticeably slower with the upper system through the
Northeast, with the CMC continuing to be a nice middle ground
(along with the NAEFS mean). The new 00z runs actually look a
little more agreeable, with the GFS slowing a bit and the ECMWF a
little faster than the previous run. The 00z UKMET remains a
fast/south outlier. The next system enters the West Coast early
next week with again, the GFS a fast/stronger outlier and wanting
to close off an upper low over the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley next Wednesday. Prefer a blend towards the
slower ECMWF/CMC along with modest inclusion of the NAEFS/ECENS
ensemble means for the later periods.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The departing low pressure system north of the Great Lakes should
continue to produce some generally light to moderate precipitation
across the Great Lakes/Northeast as a secondary surface low lifts
off the coast. Moisture and instability interacting with a warm
front lifting through the Southeast and Lower Mississippi Valley
this weekend and approach of a cold front from the north should
bring areas of moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of
those areas, but for now with low confidence in exact placement of
heaviest totals. Farther west, a system forecast to reach the West
by Saturday should continue to focus rain/mountain snow over the
central and northern West Coast into the northern Rockies late
this week into the weekend. Moisture should spread east beyond the
Rockies Sunday onward as low pressure/fronts reach the
central/eastern U.S.. At least some precipitation across the
northern tier may be in the form of snow while rainfall
coverage/intensity over the East will depend on currently
uncertain system details. The central Rockies/High Plains could
see a brief period of strong winds around Sunday with system
passage. Expect another episode of precipitation from the Pacific
Northwest/northern California into the northern Rockies early next
week, with some enhanced totals possible over favored
coastal/terrain areas.

The core of below normal temperatures across the northern High
Plains will likely persist into early next week, with daytime
highs generally 20-30F below normal, and moderating slowly with
time. Over the West, temperatures should moderate in between
systems as a period of upper ridging moves through. Saturday will
feature chilly readings over the northern half of the region
(minus 10-15F anomalies for highs) and closer to normal
temperatures farther south. As the upper ridge builds over the
region by the start of next week, northern locations should trend
toward normal and southern areas above normal. The Great Basin and
Southwest could see highs as warm as 10-15F above normal. The East
should stay near normal on Saturday, but the system potentially
reaching the Midwest/East early next week could draw some of the
chilly northern Plains air southward and eastward behind it, with
expanding coverage of minus 10-20F anomalies. The southern Plains
will see highs 10-15F above normal next weekend followed by a
cooling trend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS AND SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper low and active mid-level jet over the center of the
CONUS will continue to amplify today, keeping strong flow over the
Southwest and southern High Plains. At the surface, a cold front
moving through the Plains early this morning will scour surface
moisture resulting in very dry airmass. Strong westerly winds and
dry conditions will support active fire weather conditions within
dry fuels.

...Southern High Plains into west Texas...
As the upper trough/low over the Plains/Midwest continues to lift
away, strong northwesterly flow aloft will fill in across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Progression of the upper-level
system has generally been slower than previous guidance, suggesting
some misalignment between the strongest winds and diurnal heating.
While winds will be slightly weaker/delayed, frequent gusts to 35
mph along with strong subsidence and downsloping should still favor
extremely dry surface conditions. Model soundings showing mean
mixed-layer RH values as low as 2-3% coincident with the winds which
should support widespread Critical fire weather conditions within
extremely dry fuels. The highest confidence in winds of 30+ mph
appears to be across far eastern NM closer to the ejecting mid-level
jet. While confidence is lower, a few hours of localized Extremely
Critical conditions may occur within a corridor from eastern NM
through the southwestern TX Panhandle.

...Central High Plains...
Dry and windy conditions should develop for a few hours across the
central High Plains and lee of the Rockies in the dry post-frontal
airmass as strong flow aloft lingers over the Rockies. While surface
temperatures should be cooling, low relative humidity and gusty
winds should support downsloping and drying with RH of 10-20%
likely. Elevated and Critical fire weather conditions are possible
for a few hours before the arrival of cooler temperatures and higher
humidity later in the evening and overnight.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0205 AM CDT Wed Apr 13 2022

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
As the mid-level pattern de-amplifys in the wake of the earlier
upper trough, zonal flow will linger over the Rockies and
central/southern High Plains. Lee troughing and westerly flow will
continue to support dry and breezy conditions in the post-frontal
airmass across the central CONUS. Fuels remain dry and a few hours
of Elevated to near-Critical fire weather conditions appear likely
Thursday.

...Central/Southern High Plains...
Dry and breezy conditions behind the initial cold front are expected
Thursday with surface lee troughing supporting gusty downslope
surface winds. While the airmass will remain relatively cool, little
moisture and diurnal mixing should support RH below 25%. With winds
of 15-20 mph and some higher gusts likely closer to the higher
terrain of the central Rockies, Elevated fire weather conditions
appear likely within dry fuels.

Farther south across portions of eastern NM and the western TX
Panhandle, slightly stronger winds may develop owing to better flow
aloft within the southern stream of the mid-level jet. Model
soundings show boundary-layer max winds of 20-25 mph along with low
relative humidity of 10-15%. Widespread Elevated to near-Critical
fire weather conditions appear likely with extremely dry fuels.

...Major winter storm to bring heavy snow and blizzard conditions
to parts of the Northern Plains through Thursday...

...Significant severe weather and some flash flooding possible
today from the Lower Mississippi Valley north into the Midwest...

...Dangerous fire weather conditions for the Southern/Central High
Plains...

...Active period continues across Pacific Northwest as low
elevation rain and mountain snow impact the region...

A deep upper-level trough will rotate a potent surface low
pressure system through the eastern half of the country through
Friday. Yesterday's major winter storm will continue today over
parts of North Dakota where an additional 6-12 inches of snow may
fall by Friday morning. The combination of heavy snow with
strong/gusty winds will mean Blizzard conditions are likely with
blowing or drifting snow and dangerous low visibility for this
area through Thursday. Travel will remain difficult to impossible,
and widespread power outages and tree damage are expected.
Significant impacts to livestock are also possible. Temperatures
will continue to drop significantly on the backside of this
system, with high temperatures likely to remain 20-30 degrees
below average over the Northern Rockies/Plains today and Thursday.
Temperatures out ahead of the Winter storm will be well above
average today and Thursday with highs likely to be 15-25 degrees
warmer than normal.

Flash flooding and severe thunderstorms are likely within the warm
sector of the dynamic winter storm today. Thunderstorms and heavy
rain are expected to focus along a strong cold front that is
forecast to sweep across the Mississippi Valley today. The
heaviest rainfall capable of producing flash flooding is likely to
occur from southeastern Louisiana to southern Michigan, where a
Slight Risk of Flash Flooding is in effect. Severe thunderstorms
capable of producing several tornadoes, strong significant
damaging winds and large to very large hail will likely occur
anywhere from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Upper Midwest
today. The Storm Prediction Center issued a Moderate Risk (level
4/5) of Severe Thunderstorms over parts of the Lower/Middle
Mississippi and Tennessee Valley. Major cities like Memphis and
Little Rock are under this moderate risk.

Very dry and windy conditions paired with an existing drought,
will yield a threat for fires over portions of the Southern Plains
today. The cycling of an upper-level low will continue to drive
moisture into the Pacific Northwest through Thursday. Heavy snow
for the southern Cascades and northern Sierra as well as heavy
rain for portions of coastal northern California will persist
during this period.

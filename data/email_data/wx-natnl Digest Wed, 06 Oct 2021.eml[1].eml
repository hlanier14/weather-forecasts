Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1112 AM CDT Tue Oct 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

The elevated area across the northern Rockies was expanded to
include most of Montana and much of the northern and central High
Plains. Latest guidance consensus depicts 10-20% RH overlapped by
bouts of 10-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds across Montana.
Meanwhile, 15+ mph sustained southerly flow will coincide with
15-25% RH across much of the northern into the central High Plains
through the afternoon. The lack of an overall stronger surface wind
field precludes Critical highlights. However, locally Critical
conditions are likely in terrain-favoring areas, with broader
high-end Elevated conditions expected when taking into account
widespread critically receptive fuels. Small expansions were also
made to the Pacific Northwest Elevated area to account for the
latest guidance.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Tue Oct 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Far eastern Idaho, across Montana, and into Northwest North
Dakota...

An amplifying mid-level shortwave trough can be observed on water
vapor imagery this morning in western Montana. As it moves northeast
this morning, the surface low is expected to move into southern
Canada with the surface pressure gradient strengthening across
Montana. This will lead to increasing surface winds this afternoon.
In addition, a dry airmass will be in place with very dry afternoon
relative humidity in the 8 to 15 percent range expected.

...Northeast California, northwest Nevada, and eastern Oregon...
A strong upper-level trough is approaching the Pacific Northwest
coast this morning. As it moves east through the day, a weak surface
cyclone is expected to develop in eastern Oregon. The surface
pressure gradient in the vicinity of this surface low, and deep
mixing bringing strong mid-level flow to the surface will combine
for strong winds from northeast California and northwest Nevada into
eastern Oregon. Relative humidity is also forecast to be in the
teens across this region.

SYNOPSIS: A region of mid-level low pressure continues to be forecast acros=
s
the West during Week-2, with below-normal temperatures likely to be colocat=
ed
with this large-scale feature. Guidance continues to diverge on the possibl=
e
duration and positioning of this cold air mass throughout the forecast peri=
od.
A surface cyclone is forecast to develop downstream of the mid-level low an=
d
lift through the Northern Plains early in Week-2, bringing with it the
potential for heavy precipitation and high winds. The mid-level trough acro=
ss
Western North America may drive some limited potential for much below-norma=
l
temperatures over the Alaska Panhandle through mid-October. Substantial
uncertainty regarding the large-scale pattern limits confidence in hazardou=
s
weather potential during the second half of the forecast period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great
Basin, Rockies, and Desert Southwest, Wed-Fri, Oct 13-15.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for much of the western U.S.,
Wed-Sun, Oct 13-17.

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Northern Plains an=

Gsimaxz8PoH$

FOR WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 13 - TUESDAY OCTOBER 19: An amplified pattern across =
the
Pacific and North America continues to be shown among model guidance at the
beginning of Week-2. This circulation features anomalous 500-hPa ridging so=
uth
of the Aleutians and over Eastern Canada straddling anomalous troughing
extending from over Alaska through much of the western CONUS. Of these
features, the most pertinent from a hazardous weather perspective is the
latter
feature tied to cold air along the trough axis and precipitation potential =
to
its east. Predictability concerns continue to limit confidence in how this
trough is handled among model guidance, with discrepancies on both the
intensity and placement of this feature as Week-2 progresses. Both the GEFS
and
ECMWF agree that the feature retrogrades towards the Pacific over the first
half of the period, with the GEFS bringing the trough to the west more
rapidly.
Despite this, the GEFS tends to have the anomalous troughing hug the Pacifi=
c
Northwest through the second half of the week, while the ECMWF prefers a
placement to the west of British Columbia. Intensity differences are also
apparent, with the ECMWF being more amplified with the trough initially but
the
GEFS maintaining the intensity of this feature into the latter half of Week=
-2,
resulting in a wide array of prospective hazards dependent upon the ultimat=
e
evolution of the synoptic pattern.



Cold hazards remain posted across the West, with identical spatial coverage
relative to yesterday's outlook. The moderate risk for much below-normal
temperatures is now extended an additional day (Oct 13-15) based on the lat=
est
reforecast guidance. Conversely, the slight risk for much below-normal
temperatures has been shortened to run from the 13th through 17th. Within t=
he
moderate risk area lies the best chances for minimum temperature anomalies =
to
exceed -10 degrees F, while reforecast guidance supports a better than 40%
chance of overnight lows falling within the bottom 15% of climatology. The
more
amplified trough initially in the ECMWF again translates into colder signal=
s
among that model's associated guidance. As noted yesterday, there are some
hints that the anomalously cold air mass could spill into the Great Plains
briefly, yet the associated cold hazards are limited in their eastern exten=
t
in
order to align with today's Extended Range Forecast.



Today's Weather Prediction Center surface analysis shows lee cyclogenesis
occurring over eastern Colorado on the 12th, downstream of the longwave
trough.
This system is anticipated to lift to the north-northeast through the early
part of Week-2. Ensemble means from both the 0Z GEFS and ECMWF models today
show a bullseye of a half to three quarters of an inch of liquid centered o=
n
the Dakotas on the 13th tied to likely heavy precipitation associated with =
the
deformation zone developing on the northwestern side of the cyclone.
Reforecast-based guidance also highlights increased heavy precipitation
potential over the Northern Plains, supporting an upgrade to a moderate ris=
k
of
heavy precipitation for the 13th (snow likely at least for the western port=
ion
of the shape, with uncertainty regarding precipitation type increasing furt=
her
east). Six inches or more of snowfall is possible on the northwestern side =
of
the surface low. A slight risk for heavy precipitation now stretches from
eastern Montana through the Great Lakes then south-southwestward through th=
e
Oklahoma/Arkansas border on the 13th. Models have been slightly more
progressive with the surface low relative to yesterday's guidance, save for
today's 12Z deterministic GFS, resulting in the previous heavy snow hazard
being merged into the larger heavy precipitation areas. The slight risk for
high winds (sustained winds >30 mph, or gusts >45 mph) tied to the deepenin=
g
low is maintained from yesterday's outlook for the 13th and 14th, with the
only
modification being some minor adjustments to the southern and eastern exten=
ts.
The associated wind risk is likely to lift northward with time, and by the
14th, only approximately the northern third of the highlighted region may b=
e
experiencing high winds.



In addition to the hazards highlighted for the CONUS above, a few marginal
areas bear monitoring. First, much above-normal temperatures are possible f=
or
the Midwest on the 13th tied to southerly flow ahead of the surface cyclone
tracking across the Northern Plains. GEFS reforecast guidance shows better
than
a 10% chance for daily record highs centered over the western Great Lakes o=
n
this date, although the corresponding temperatures range from 80-85 degrees=
 F
which, while noteworthy for mid-October, are not particularly hazardous. At

...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

The stagnant upper low over the east-central U.S. during the short
range should be diminishing by Friday, with general troughing
lingering along the East Coast through the weekend and upper
ridging trying to build back in early next week. To the west,
amplified troughing will drive a cold front through the Central
U.S. this weekend, eventually weakening across the Midwest. The
next system should dig into the Western states late this weekend,
amplifying into a fairly deep system by the day 6-7 period. The
latest guidance generally agrees on a deep system, but disagree on
the details. Some of the models show the potential for a closed
low to develop over the Rockies/Southwest region, but there
remains plenty of run-to-run variability and uncertainty.

The WPC blend used a nearly equal blend of the 00z ECMWF, CMC, and
06z GFS for days 3-4. Began incorporating minor amounts of the
ensemble means (ECENS/GEFS) to try and mitigate details
differences that arise both with respect to the initial troughing
across the Central/Midwest states and then with the late period
trough over the West. By day 7, the blend is a 50 percent ensemble
mean and 50 percent GFS/ECMWF combo. This approach maintains good
continuity with the previous WPC shift.

...Weather/Hazards highlights...

Enhanced rainfall may continue into the medium range period over
parts of the southern/central Appalachians, with a continued
runoff/flood threat as heavy rainfall is also expected during the
short range period over this same region. By Friday, the focus
should shift to the coast where a frontal boundary and area of low
pressure, with low tropical development probabilities, could bring
localized heavy rainfall to portions of the Outer Banks/Southeast
Coast Saturday-Sunday. Meanwhile, the first front lifting through
the north-central U.S. could bring moderate to locally heavy
rainfall to parts of the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley this weekend. Temperatures ahead of the front across the
Central U.S. into parts of the Northeast should be somewhat warm,
with daytime highs averaging 5-15F above normal.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, with moisture
shifting inland along the attendant cold front. Deep troughing
will bring much below normal temperatures behind the cold front
with daytime highs as much as 20-25 degrees below normal across
much of the interior West, especially by next Monday and Tuesday.
This would support lowering snow levels in the mountains with
potential for decent snow accumulations in the highest terrain of
the northern Rockies.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue October 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 11 - 15 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A weak trough is forecast over eastern Siberia and Bering
Sea,
while an amplified ridge is predicted south of the Alaska Peninsula. A deep
trough with below normal 500-hPa heights and mean cyclonic flow are expecte=
d
across most of the western half of the CONUS. Strong ridging with above nor=
mal
heights are forecast farther to the east across much of northeastern North
America. The manual 500-hPa height blend, based primarily on the ensemble
means
from the GEFS and ECMWF, depicts near to above normal heights across the
western Aleutians. Conversely, near to below normal heights are favored for
much of the remainder of Alaska.

With strong ridging forecast over northeastern North America, above normal
temperatures are favored for the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal
temperatures are favored over western CONUS underneath predicted troughing =
and
below normal 500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over
northern and eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle underneath
predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Near to above normal
temperature probabilities are elevated over the western Aleutians, under ne=
ar
to above normal 500-hPa heights.

Predicted troughing and associated below normal 500-hPa heights increase th=
e
odds of near to above normal precipitation over most of the western and
central
CONUS, except for parts of New Mexico, southeastern Arizona and western Tex=
as
where below normal precipitation is favored. Near to below normal
precipitation
is likely for most of the eastern quarter of the CONUS underneath forecast
ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Troughing and associated surface =
low
pressure increase the odds of near to above normal precipitation over south=
ern
Alaska, while below normal precipitation is favored in northern Alaska,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 13 - 19 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is generally forecast to become les=
s
amplified over the CONUS. A predicted trough and below normal 500-hPa heigh=
ts
are forecast over the western CONUS, while ridging and above normal 500-hPa
heights are predicted to persist over the eastern CONUS. A predicted trough
and
below normal heights are more likely over the eastern Aleutians, Mainland
Alaska, and the Alaska Panhandle.

The temperature pattern forecast for the week 2 period is similar to the 6-=
10
day outlook period. With mean troughing expected to persist across the west=
ern
CONUS, below normal temperatures are favored for the western CONUS. Above
normal temperatures are likely for most areas of the central and eastern CO=
NUS
underneath the forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Near to
below
normal temperatures are slightly favored for Alaska, associated with mean
troughing forecast over the state.

Predicted troughing and possible enhanced moisture advection increase the o=
dds
of near to above normal precipitation over most of the western and central
CONUS, except for parts of the Four Corners region where below normal
precipitation is favored. Near to below normal precipitation is likely for
most
 of the eastern third of the CONUS underneath forecast ridging and above
normal
 500-hPa heights. Troughing and associated surface low pressure increase th=
e
odds of near to above normal precipitation over Alaska

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fa=
ir
model agreement.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EXTREME EASTERN MONTANA INTO
WESTERN NORTH DAKOTA AND FAR NORTHWESTERN SOUTH DAKOTA...

Latest guidance consensus continues to indicate 20-25 mph sustained
southerly winds overlapping with 20-25% RH tomorrow afternoon across
portions of the northern High Plains, where Elevated highlights are
in place. A Critical area has been maintained where confidence is
highest in surface winds sustained above 20 mph amid RH dipping to
or below 20% for at least a few hours around afternoon peak heating.
Questions remain regarding how widespread the Critical wind/RH
overlap will be. However, near-record dry fuels present across the
northern High Plains should compensate to support a robust
wildfire-spread threat. In addition, at least locally Elevated
conditions are expected to accompany the post-cold frontal
environment across central Montana tomorrow, but the brief nature of
these conditions precludes Elevated highlights this outlook.

..Squitieri.. 10/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Tue Oct 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
Lee cyclogenesis is forecast across Canada on Tuesday night with a
near 1000mb surface low expected by Wednesday afternoon. This will
act to tighten the pressure gradient across much of the northern
Plains. The greatest overlap of strong winds and dry relative
humidity is forecast across far eastern Montana and the western
Dakotas. Fuels in this region are near record dryness with ERC
values above the 99th percentile. Therefore, critical fire weather
conditions are expected in the western Dakotas and possibly far
eastern Montana.

...Heavy rain and flash flooding likely across parts of the
Central Gulf Coast and Southern Appalachians through Thursday...

...Severe weather and isolated instances of flash flooding
possible across central Arizona this evening...

...Well above average temperatures as well as the potential for
Critical Fire Weather found throughout the Northern Plains...

A pair of upper-level lows, one currently over the Southwest and
the other over the Lower Mississippi Valley, will help fuel active
weather across both ends of the country through the middle of the
week. Starting in the Southeast, rich moisture flowing out of the
Gulf of Mexico and ahead of the aforementioned upper-level low
will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms capable of
producing intense downpours from the Central Gulf Coast to the
Southern Appalachians. A slow-moving frontal boundary sliding down
the Mid-Atlantic will also help focus a lot of atmospheric
moisture into the region. This weather pattern is not expected to
change much through at least Thursday, which means areas
experiencing heavy rain today could be in for several more rounds
before the week is over. A Moderate Risk (level 3/4) of Excessive
Rainfall has been issued through tonight across far southern
Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, extending into
Wednesday for areas in and around the Emerald Coast of Florida. A
Moderate Risk of Excessive Rainfall has also been issued on
Thursday across parts of northern Georgia, northeast Alabama, and
southeast Tennessee. Flash Flood Watches are in effect as well and
extend from southeast Tennessee to the western Florida Panhandle.
Additional rainfall amounts of the 2 to 4 inches can be expected
here, with locally higher amounts.

Farther west, a stormy evening and night is in store for central
Arizona and surrounding areas of the Southwest and central Great
Basin. An upper-level low is forecast to lift across the region
tonight before being absorbed into an approaching deep upper-level
trough. Isolated severe thunderstorms with damaging wind gusts,
large hail, and isolated tornadoes are possible. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe
weather across central Arizona through early Wednesday morning. A
few instances of heavy rain resulting in flash flooding is also a
concern. Otherwise, a rather potent cold front entering the
Northwest and West Coast this evening will produce chances for
showers and high elevation snow across the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Great Basin, before reaching the Northern Rockies and
Central Great Basin by Thursday morning.

Outside of the West and cloud covered Southeast, much of the Lower
48 are forecast to experience above average temperatures through
Thursday. The greatest anomalies and potential hazards associated
with the warm temperatures are expected to be found across the
Northern Plains. High temperatures reaching into the low 90s today
and upper 80s tomorrow, combined with low relative humidity and
gusty winds may lead lead to Critical Fire Weather across the
western Dakotas. This means wildfires will have the potential to
spread uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings have been issued and
extend from north-central Montana to western North Dakota and
northwest South Dakota.

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 08 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 12 2021

...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

The stagnant upper low over the east-central U.S. during the short
range should be diminishing by Friday, with general troughing
lingering along the East Coast through the weekend and upper
ridging trying to build back in early next week. To the west,
amplified troughing will drive a cold front through the Central
U.S. this weekend, eventually weakening across the Midwest. The
next system should dig into the Western states late this weekend,
amplifying into a fairly deep system by the day 6-7 period. The
latest guidance generally agrees on a deep system, but disagree on
the details. Some of the models show the potential for a closed
low to develop over the Rockies/Southwest region, but there
remains plenty of run-to-run variability and uncertainty.

The WPC blend used a nearly equal blend of the 00z ECMWF, CMC, and
06z GFS for days 3-4. Began incorporating minor amounts of the
ensemble means (ECENS/GEFS) to try and mitigate details
differences that arise both with respect to the initial troughing
across the Central/Midwest states and then with the late period
trough over the West. By day 7, the blend is a 50 percent ensemble
mean and 50 percent GFS/ECMWF combo. This approach maintains good
continuity with the previous WPC shift.

...Weather/Hazards highlights...

Enhanced rainfall may continue into the medium range period over
parts of the southern/central Appalachians, with a continued
runoff/flood threat as heavy rainfall is also expected during the
short range period over this same region. By Friday, the focus
should shift to the coast where a frontal boundary and area of low
pressure, with low tropical development probabilities, could bring
localized heavy rainfall to portions of the Outer Banks/Southeast
Coast Saturday-Sunday. Meanwhile, the first front lifting through
the north-central U.S. could bring moderate to locally heavy
rainfall to parts of the northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley this weekend. Temperatures ahead of the front across the
Central U.S. into parts of the Northeast should be somewhat warm,
with daytime highs averaging 5-15F above normal.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, with moisture
shifting inland along the attendant cold front. Deep troughing
will bring much below normal temperatures behind the cold front
with daytime highs as much as 20-25 degrees below normal across
much of the interior West, especially by next Monday and Tuesday.
This would support lowering snow levels in the mountains with
potential for decent snow accumulations in the highest terrain of
the northern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1215 AM CDT Wed Oct 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR EASTERN MONTANA...WESTERN
NORTH DAKOTA...AND NORTHWEST SOUTH DAKOTA...

...Synopsis...
Lee cyclogenesis has already begun in southern Canada. Expect
further strengthening of the surface low through the day today as
heights fall across the Canadian Rockies. As this surface low
deepens, the surface pressure gradient will tighten and lead to
strengthening surface flow. Winds are forecast to be 20 to 25 mph.
In addition, warm and dry conditions are forecast in the region with
temperatures warming into the 80s. This will lead to relative
humidity in the teens. ERC values in the region are near record
high. These dry fuels and dry and breezy conditions will lead to
critical fire weather conditions in portions of the northern Plains.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1216 AM CDT Wed Oct 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Cool conditions are expected across much of the western CONUS on
Thursday which should keep relative humidity above 25 percent in
most of the region. The exception will be far southern Arizona and
much of New Mexico where relative humidity will be in the 15 to 25
mph range. However, winds will be mostly light across this region.
Stronger winds are expected across portions of the Plains, but the
strongest winds are forecast where dewpoints are higher. Therefore,
no areas of fire weather concern are expected on Thursday.

...Guidance Evaluation/preferences...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite model and ensemble blend days 3-7 with the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS Mean 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble means and the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models prominantly weighted along with WPC
continuity. Guidance forecasts are overall reasonably well
clustered with the mid-larger scale pattern evolution into next
week, bolstering forecast confidence to a degree, but tempered by
continued run to run variability with the details and timings of a
multitude of complex embedded systems in two streams. A composite
of the latest 00 UTC model and ensemble suite still seems in line
with this forecast plan. In particular, the 00 UTC UKMET has
trended in this direction versus an outlier 12 UTC earlier run.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards highlights...

While a lingering rainfall axis will continue into the weekend
from the Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians to the Great Lakes, the
focus this weekend into next week should shift to the
coast/offshore where a frontal boundary and area of low pressure,
with limited tropical development probabilities, could bring some
heavy downpours to portions of the coastal Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.

Upstream, a front lifting through the north-central U.S. will
bring moderate to locally heavy rainfall to parts of the northern
Plains/Upper Midwest this weekend. Amplified approach of southern
stream upper trough energy underneath over the south-central
Plains and Mid-Lower MS Valley should act to focus
moisture/instability to fuel an increasingly favorable convection
environment Sun/Mon, lifting and shearing over the Midwest/Great
Lakes Tue.

Out West, moderate to heavy rainfall and mountain snow is possible
across parts of the Pacific Northwest this weekend, with moisture
shifting southward and inland with a wavy/lead front. Deep
troughing and closed upper low development down over the
Southwest/Great Basin into early-mid next week will bring much
below normal temperatures behind the cold front with daytime highs
as much as 20-25 degrees below normal across much of the interior
West well into next week. This would support lowering snow levels
in the mountains with potential for decent snow accumulations in
the higher terrain of the north-central Rockies and in an emerging
deformation area with the closed low. Ample upper trough/low
energies slated to shift from the West/Rockies into the Plains
next midweek would foster cyclogenesis/frontogenesis and emerging
convective rainfall fueled by building moisture/instability.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast and the Southern Appalachian/Tennessee
Valley through Thursday morning...

...Air Quality Alerts over the San Joaquin Valley through
Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains into the Upper Mississippi
Valley; there is a Critical Risk of Fire Weather over the Northern
High Plains...

An upper-level low over Lower Mississippi Valley will slowly move
northward movement to the Great Lakes by Friday.  The circulation
around the upper-level low will stream moisture northward over the
Central Gulf Coast to the Southeast, extending into roughly the
Ohio Valley/Great Lakes on Thursday and into the Mid-Atlantic by
Friday.  The moisture will aid in producing showers and
thunderstorms over the Central Gulf Coast/Southeast into the Ohio
Valley/Mid-Atlantic, producing heavy rain through Friday.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Central Gulf Coast and the Southern
Appalachian/Tennessee Valley through Thursday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Thursday morning.

The threat of excessive rainfall will lessen on Thursday into
Friday to a Slight Risk over the Southern Appalachians/Tennessee.
In addition, on Thursday, showers and thunderstorms will extend
into parts of the Great Lakes/Upper Mississippi Valley. In the
meantime, showers and thunderstorms over parts of the
Central/Southern Rockies into parts of the Great Basin/Southwest
will slowly end by tonight.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern Rockies
southwestward to Central California will slowly move eastward to
the Northern Plains to the Great Basin by Friday.  Weak onshore
flow will help produce rain over parts of the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California, slowly taper off from south to
north by Thursday morning. Scattered showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and near the boundary over parts of the Great
Basin into the Northern Rockies starting by tonight.

Furthermore, the smoke from wildfires will lead to poor air
quality over the San Joaquin Valley of California, where Air
Quality Alerts are in effect through today.  Additionally, an
upper-level ridge will develop over parts of the Upper Midwest as
temperatures will become 10 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern/Central High Plains into the Upper Mississippi
Valley.  The above-average temperatures, lowering relative
humidity, and gusty wind lead to a Critical Risk of Fire Weather
over the Northern High Plains.  Consequently, Red Flag Warnings
are over parts of the Northern High Plains.

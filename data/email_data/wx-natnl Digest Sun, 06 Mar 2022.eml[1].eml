Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CST Sat Mar 05 2022

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR AREAS FROM EASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
EASTERN KANSAS...

Winds of 20 to 25 mph are already ongoing across the central Plains
with stronger winds expected through the afternoon. In addition,
temperatures have warmed into the 60s to low 70s with a rapidly
advancing dryline bringing sub 25 degree dewpoints in its wake.
Therefore, the ongoing forecast remains mostly on track. Trimmed the
northern extent of the elevated/critical delineations as those
regions saw some rainfall this morning and 12Z guidance does not
show the dry air getting as far north as previous guidance.

..Bentley.. 03/05/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Sat Mar 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will impact the southern and central
Plains today. This trough will promote a deepening surface cyclone
along the Kansas/Colorado border. This cyclone will move northeast
during the day, accelerating into the upper Midwest by Sunday
morning.

...Central and eastern Kansas...
Fire weather conditions across this region are expected to be quite
high given the favorable overlap of the mid-level and low-level jet.
Winds of 20-30 mph are expected with locally higher speeds possible.
RH of 15-20% is probable, though values near 10% are not out of the
question. Along with very dry fuels, these meteorological conditions
will support periods of extremely critical fire weather. Continued
uncertainty with the duration of these conditions precludes
highlights. The main reason for this uncertainty is the
southeastward progressing cold front. While the front may keep the
most extreme conditions brief, it will also mean an abrupt wind
shift that would impact any ongoing fires.

...Southern High Plains...
With the front remaining north of the region, warmer temperatures
should more readily support critically low RH. The most favorable
overlap of stronger low/mid-level winds will occur in the Texas
Panhandle. There, RH around 15% and winds of 20-25 mph will support
critical fire weather. Similar RH can be expected farther
south/southeast, but the duration of stronger surface winds is
uncertain.

...Overview...

Strong ridge axes off either coast should keep much of the CONUS
within broad and reinforced troughing through this next week.
Amplified troughing from a low gyre centered over Baffin Island to
begin the week will shift south down the center of the continent,
pushing an Arctic cold front down the Great Plains through Friday
before shifting to the East Coast through Saturday. A resulting
low looks to develop over the Upper Midwest Thursday night before
lifting northeast through eastern Canada through Saturday. Ahead
of this trough can be expected continued wintry weather across the
northern Intermountain West Wednesday into Thursday before it
shifts to the Midwest for Thursday/Friday, as well as two rounds
of moderate to locally heavy rain for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Good agreement for a slower pattern over the CONUS is seen with
the 06Z (and now 12Z) GFS/ and the 00Z ECMWF, particularly by 12Z
Thur with the positively tilted trough digging over The West. The
00Z UKMET/CMC are much quicker to shift this trough axis neutral
and advance it over the central CONUS. Both the 06Z GEFS and 00Z
ECENS means were not as slow/positively tilted with the trough, so
the bulk of the model preference were the 06Z GFS/00Z ECENS
through Day 5 before shifting toward the GEFS/ECENS by Day 6.

Energy diving into The West on Wednesday will reinforce and
amplify troughing over Interior West which looks to maintain the
positive tilt as it presses south into Mexico and across the
northern Plains Friday. Lee cyclogenesis spreads down the High
Plains from CO Wednesday/Thursday, with a developing surface low
lifting northeast from the central Plains across the Upper Midwest
Thursday/Thursday night.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A shortwave trough over the southern Plains Tuesday evening shifts
across the Mid-Atlantic through Wednesday making for widespread
rain/thunder chances over the Interior Southeast along a cold
front on Day 4 that settles to the Southeast Coast/Florida/eastern
Gulf Coast for Days 5/6 and possibly 7. Heavy snow, with snow
levels dropping to the valleys before ending, shifts south across
the northern Intermountain West through the southern Rockies
Tuesday night through Friday. As the lee low shifts down the
southern High Plains Wednesday, snow develops over the
north-central Plains Wednesday before shifting across the Upper
Midwest Wednesday night through Thursday night as noted by the
Days 5/6 WPC winter weather outlook.

Arctic-sourced air enters the Northern Plains Tuesday night and is
reinforced by even colder air Wednesday night shift sends a cold
surge behind an Arctic cold front down the Plains to the western
Gulf coast through Friday. Min temps of 10 to 15 degrees below
normal in MT Wednesday intensify to 20 to 25 degrees below normal
(with many areas around zero to minus single digits) and expand
across the northern Plains/Rockies to the central High Plains
Wednesday night. Some moderation occurs as the cold air mass
spills well into the southern Plains Thursday night and into south
Texas Friday night though anomalies of 20 to 25 degrees below
normal are likely to be maintained. This cold air begins to shift
east Friday, reaching the Appalachians Saturday. Above normal
temperatures are expected over the eastern CONUS ahead of the cold
front except for the coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast where cold air
damming looks to linger Wednesday into Thursday in the wake of the
cold front pushing through on Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 PM CST Sat Mar 05 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE TRANS-PECOS INTO
SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND ADJACENT SOUTH PLAINS....

Expanded the critical area based on a more expansive region of dry
and windy conditions expected. The southeastward expansion may only
have marginally critical winds (around 20 mph), but relative
humidity is expected to be below 5 percent across this region which
should justify a critical fire weather risk.

..Bentley.. 03/05/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0100 AM CST Sat Mar 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
On the heels of Saturday's strong trough, another trough will rotate
through the southern High Plains on Sunday. At the surface, another
cyclone, albeit weaker than Saturday, will develop in the Permian
Basin and move southeast through the day. A cold front will then
move through the region during the evening.

Critical fire weather is most likely from the Trans-Pecos into
southeast New Mexico and adjacent parts of the Texas South Plains.
These areas will be impacted by a favorably aligned low and
mid-level jet during the afternoon. Single digit RH will be
possible, particularly into western Texas. Otherwise, 10-20% will
occur broadly. Winds will most likely reach 20-25 mph with locally
higher speeds near 30 mph possible. This brings the potential for
locally extreme fire weather concerns. With the somewhat weaker
surface low expected, confidence in 30+ mph winds remains too low
for extremely critical highlights.

...Dynamic storm system to produce areas of significant freezing
rain and heavy snow over the Upper Great Lakes tonight, with
severe thunderstorms possible in parts of the Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley this evening, and gusty winds from the Midwest
to the Great Lakes on Sunday...

...Next system to enter the central U.S. late Sunday to spread the
potential for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding from eastern
Oklahoma to the Ohio Valley, with light snow extending from parts
of the Midwest to the Great Lakes by Monday morning...

...Moderate to heavy snow forecast across the Central/Southern
Rockies through Monday...

...Record-breaking warmth expected throughout parts of the East on
Sunday and Monday, while Critical Fire Weather remains over the
Southern High Plains on Sunday...


The driving forces behind the active weather pattern located
throughout much of the Nation is associated with a deep
upper-level trough positioned over the western U.S. and strong
upper-level ridging  over the Southeast. Within the aforementioned
upper-level trough, two separate shortwaves and mid-level lows
will aid in spawning succeeding storm systems to track from the
Central Plains to the Northeast. This first system is already
impacting parts of the Midwest, Northern Plains, and Upper Great
Lakes with wintry weather and scattered thunderstorms. A low
pressure system is forecast to move from Iowa this afternoon and
into the U.P. of Michigan by Sunday morning. Meanwhile, an
associated warm front will lift northward across the Great Lakes
and Northeast, ushering in well above average temperatures within
the warm sector. An attached cold front is also forecast to swing
through the Great Lakes on Sunday as the area of low pressure
strengthens and progresses into southern Quebec, Canada. Weather
hazards associated with system tonight include areas of moderate
to heavy snow from eastern South Dakota, across central Minnesota,
and into far northern Wisconsin. A few inches of snow falling
quickly and after sunset can make travel treacherous at times.
Meanwhile, pockets of significant freezing rain will remain a
concern into early Sunday from northern Wisconsin to the western
U.P. of Michigan. Rain falling over extended period of time with
surface temperatures below freezing could lead to total ice
accretion amounts up to a half inch. This amount of ice can lead
to power outages and tree damage. Ice Storm Warnings, Winter Storm
Warnings, and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect. On the warm
side of this system, a potent cold front will spark thunderstorms
this evening throughout parts of the Midwest. Several storms could
turn severe across south-central Iowa and northern Missouri.
Damaging wind gusts associated with these thunderstorms are the
most likely hazard, but isolated tornadoes and large hail are also
possible. Additionally, gusty winds will accompany the cold front
into Sunday across much of the Great Lakes. Gusts up to 65 mph are
possible and could create power outages and difficult driving
conditions for high profile vehicles. High Wind Watches/Warnings
and Wind Advisories extend from central Iowa to western New York.

By Sunday evening, the next ejecting shortwave is forecast to
enter the Central Plains and spawn an area of low pressure along a
quasi-stationary boundary over eastern Oklahoma. Scattered
thunderstorms will likely develop along this boundary to the east
of the surface low and could produce heavy rain, which may lead to
instances of flash flooding from the Middle/Lower Mississippi
Valley to the Ohio Valley through Monday morning. Isolated severe
thunderstorms are also a possibility on Sunday from southeast
Oklahoma to far western Kentucky. As this system moves
northeastward on Sunday, the severe weather threat will shift east
along the cold front. SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms on Monday that extends from West Virginia to central
Alabama/Mississippi. Chances for scattered flash flooding will
also remain over parts of the Ohio Valley as additional rainfall
occurs over areas that could have susceptible soils due to
previous rainfall. WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall on Monday from Kentucky to southwest Pennsylvania.
Farther north, colder air found over the Midwest and Great Lakes
will allow for a swath of light to moderate snow from parts of
Iowa to Michigan on Monday.

During the entire short range forecast period (through Monday),
much of the central and southern Rockies will be under the
influence of a deep upper-level trough, which will allow for
continuing periods of snow. Total snowfall amounts over 6 inches
are likely over the higher terrain of northern Utah, southwestern
Wyoming, Colorado, and northern New Mexico. A few inches of snow
may also extend into the Colorado Front Range on Sunday. Winter
Weather Advisories are in effect for most of these regions.

Elsewhere, the other major weather story will be associated with
record-breaking warmth extending throughout the eastern U.S. on
Sunday and Monday. Highs into the 70s will surge as far north as
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, with 80s possible into northern
Virginia on Monday ahead of the approaching cold front. These
temperatures equate to around 20 to 30 degrees above average and
will likely cause numerous daily records to fall. Below average
temperatures will be found behind the cold front in the
Intermountain West and Great Plains, with temperatures around 10
to 25 degrees below average. For the Southern High Plains and
parts of the Southeast, above average temperatures will lead to
low relative humidity and create dangerous fire weather conditions
in tandem with gusty winds. Red Flag Warnings have been issued.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat March 05 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19910222 - 19970223 - 19700222 - 19900302 - 20000218


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)

201 AM EST Sun Mar 06 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 09 2022 - 12Z Sun Mar 13 2022

...Overview...

Strong ridge axes off both the East and West coast should keep
much of the CONUS within broad and reinforced troughing next week.
A shortwave diving into the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday will
shift south and east into the central and eventually the eastern
U.S. next weekend. This will push an Arctic cold front down the
Great Plains through Friday while a low develops along the front
and deepens as it lifts into the Upper Great Lakes on Friday.
Expect wintry weather to the northwest of the low from the central
Rockies/Plains to the upper Midwest, with rounds of showers and
storms ahead of the system across the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic. As
the low lifts quickly into eastern Canada next Saturday, the cold
front should clear the East Coast ushering in a much chillier air
mass. By next Sunday/day 7, flow across the CONUS should become
more zonal with weak systems through the northern tier states.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Fairly good agreement on the advancement of amplified troughing
across the interior West and into the central states
Wednesday-Thursday. By Friday and beyond, more differences in the
details of possible stream splitting begins to emerge. Notable
outlier amongst the 12z/18z guidance from yesterday is the CMC
which is slower and much more amplified late week, closing off an
upper low over the Midwest on Saturday (00z CMC came in generally
the same). This also gets it out of sync with the next shortwave
entering the Pacific Northwest on Sunday. The GFS and ECMWF show
much better consistency with the ensemble means but there are some
timing differences next weekend with the northern stream shortwave
into the Northeast (GFS faster). Also some lingering uncertainties
with regards to amplitude and timing of the Pacific Northwest
shortwave next Sunday, though there is plenty of time for those
details to be worked out.

The WPC blend for tonight used a multi deterministic model
consensus days 3-5. For 6-7, removed the CMC due to issues
outlined above and increased contributions from the GEFS/ECENS
ensemble means to mitigate the detail differences. Was able to
maintain at least 50 percent deterministic GFS and ECMWF which
helped give some added definition to individual systems.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A stationary boundary settling across the Southeast should keep
showers and storms in the forecast Wednesday-Friday. Even though
amounts don't seem overly high for any given day at this point,
multiple days of rain may increase concerns for flooding.
Meanwhile, a shortwave through the West on Wednesday will continue
a threat for heavy mountain snows for parts of the interior West
and central Rockies. A low pressure spinning up in the lee of the
Rockies and lifting into the Upper Midwest Thursday-Friday brings
a winter storm threat from the central Plains to the Upper
Midwest. The elongated upper trough should tap Gulf of Mexico
moisture with widespread rain into the East ahead of the cold
front on Friday. The next system into the Northwest next weekend
should increase rain and mountain snow chances across the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.

Arctic sourced air spills into the Plains, with daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas through Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains will likely be near or
below zero for many locations. Ahead of the cold front, above
normal temperatures will spread across the Eastern third of the
country Thursday and Friday before being replaced by below normal
temps by Saturday following the passage of the cold front. By next
Sunday, most of the country should modify closer to normal as
upper flow become less amplified.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 AM CST Sun Mar 06 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW
MEXICO...TRANS-PECOS...WESTERN SOUTH PLAINS...WESTERN PERMIAN
BASIN...

...Synopsis...
Another potent mid-level jet will swing through the Southwest and
into the southern High Plains during the afternoon today. A modest
surface low will develop in West Texas and move southeastward
roughly along the Rio Grande. To the north, a cold front will remain
quasi-stationary through late afternoon. Thereafter, it will
progress through western and central portions of Texas.

Critical fire weather is expected from the Trans-Pecos into
southeastern New Mexico and adjacent portions of the South Plains
and Permian Basin. Strong winds are again expected as the mid-level
jet couples with strong 850 mb flow. Surface speeds of 20-25 mph
will be common. Localized 30+ mph winds are certainly possible, but
the modest surface low suggests it will remain spatially
constrained. RH across eastern New Mexico in to western Texas will
fall to 10-15%. Locally extremely critical conditions may occur on a
localized basis as it does not appear the strongest winds will
overlap single digit RH for very long. The primary area for this
will likely be east-central New Mexico into the South Plains where
better low/mid-level wind alignment will occur. RH near 5% also
appears probable within the Big Bend region as downslope drying
occurs off of the Mexican Plateau. Winds are expected to reach 20
mph, but will likely fall short of 30 mph given the stronger
mid-level winds being displaced to the north.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A band of strong mid-level winds will stretch from the southern High
Plains into the Northeast on Sunday. At the surface, a cold front
will be through the southern Plains and continue to make
southeastward progress across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Cooler
conditions and precipitation are expected to keep fire weather
concerns low across most areas.

...Eastern Georgia into central South Carolina...
Ahead of the approaching cold front, breezy southwesterly winds are
likely. With temperatures warming into the upper 80s F, some areas
may observe RH near 30%. 10-hour fuel information from the Georgia
Forestry Commission suggests that fire weather concerns will likely
be localized as moisture levels are generally 15-20%. These
conditions will be monitored, however, as elevated meteorological
conditions are possible if not probable.

Critical Fire Weather risk remains over the Southern/Central
Plains today...


A series of shortwaves rotating around an upper-level trough will
promote an active weather pattern throughout much of the central
and eastern CONUS over the next couple of days. A deep and dynamic
low pressure system responsible for freezing rain over the Upper
Midwest yesterday will generate gusty winds across the Midwest
today as it departs into southeastern Canada. High wind warnings
and advisories are in effect for much of the Midwest and Great
Lakes as a result. Meanwhile, another shortwave trough will emerge
over the Great Plains today, spawning an area of surface low
pressure over the Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley. This surface
low will develop along a trailing cold front from the departing
Midwest system. This boundary will become the focus for severe
weather across portions of the Southern Plains, Lower/Middle
Mississippi Valley, and Tennessee/Ohio Valley today, where the
Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight Risk of Severe
Thunderstorms. An Enhanced Risk of Severe Thunderstorms is in
effect for the Missouri/Arkansas border today. The main risks
associated with today's severe weather will be a few tornadoes and
damaging wind gusts. Heavy rainfall leading to potential flash
flooding will occur along the surface front over the Lower/Middle
Mississippi Valley and Ohio/Tennessee Valley today due to the
continued fetch of moisture pumping into the region from the Gulf
of Mexico. A Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall is in effect as a
result. Light snow will spread from the Central Plains to the
Upper Great Lakes today within the cold sector of the developing
system. The focus for flash flooding and severe thunderstorms
shifts eastward into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and Southeast on
Monday, where heavy rain and damaging wind gusts will cause
problems.

Elsewhere, a strong warm front associated with the departing low
pressure system will gradually lift through the Northeast today
allowing for very mild air to settle over the eastern U.S. through
Monday. Temperatures are likely to be between 20-30 degrees above
average in many places. This will lead to the likelihood of
widespread high/low temperature records being tied or broken today
and Monday. Warm temperatures paired with dry conditions and gusty
winds will continue to promote the chance for fire weather over
parts of the Central/Southern Plains today. A Critical Fire
Weather Risk is in effect for parts of the Texas/Oklahoma
Panhandle and central Oklahoma/Kansas. A cold front should sweep
across the South and East Monday evening, moderating temperatures
in its wake. High pressure will continue pushing through much of
the western half of the country today. High temperatures over the
Front Range are likely to be 20-30 degrees below average today and
tomorrow. The shortwave responsible for generating today and
tomorrow's hazardous weather over the central U.S. will also
produce heavy snowfall over parts of the Central/Southern Rockies.
A weaker piece of shortwave energy will generate lighter snow over
the same area tonight before things quiet down. Additional
troughing from western Canada will drop down into the Pacific
Northwest by Tuesday morning. This trough will pull Pacific
moisture into the region, which will produce low elevation rain
and mountain snow over the Cascades and Northern Rockies.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1120 AM CDT Mon May 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

Minor adjustments were made to the elevated area to include portions
of the northern La Basin. While the overall synoptic pattern will
favor primarily local effects, very warm temperatures, extremely dry
fuels, and enhanced down-valley winds will likely support elevated
to locally critical fire weather conditions across much of central
and southern California this afternoon and evening.  In addition,
while moisture will be limited, the very warm temperatures may
support enough buoyancy for a thunderstorm or two this afternoon. A
few lightning strikes will be possible with any high-based storms
that develop. See the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 05/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Mon May 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will continue to build along the West Coast as broad
troughing prevails across the central and eastern CONUS today.
Thermal-low development across central California will promote
onshore dry and breezy conditions supportive of some wildfire-spread
concerns. Accumulating rainfall across the southern Plains and weak
surface winds across the eastern third of the CONUS is expected to
limit widespread significant wildfire-spread potential. Terrain
favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River Basin may experience
brief periods of channeled flow, with locally Elevated conditions
possible during the afternoon given widespread 10-15% RH.

...Central California...
Upper ridging along the West Coast will promote very warm
temperatures (exceeding 90F by afternoon peak heating) across much
of California, where surface thermal-low development and associated
onshore flow is expected during the afternoon. Downslope flow along
the Diablo Range will promote 15 mph sustained westerly surface
winds and 10-20% RH atop unseasonably dry fuels across the lower
Sacramento into the San Joaquin Valleys, as shown by some of the
latest high-resolution guidance. The very warm temperatures may also
support localized plume-dominated wildfire potential in and
surrounding the Elevated area, where upslope flow across
terrain-favoring areas overlaps with the 90+ F surface temperatures.

...Record warmth likely through Thursday across parts of the
West...

...Heavy rainfall possible for parts of the Southern Plains
Saturday and Sunday...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most of the guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday). This means strong ridging over the West to
start the period Thursday will be replaced by a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. by the weekend. Meanwhile, heights are
forecast to rise across the East as mean ridging prevails over the
western Atlantic. Between this however, there remains considerable
spread on what becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley
trough and a High Plains upper trough (or low). The specifics of
these features will likely have considerable influence on the
distribution and intensity of rainfall over the eastern and
southern portions of the lower 48.

The models and ensembles show good agreement the first couple of
days to warrant a purely operational model blend for Thursday into
early Friday.  After this, the guidance shows general agreement,
outside the GFS (more progressive with systems in the Westerlies
and weaker with an upper low over TX) and the Canadian late (which
becomes somewhat deep/out of phase late with the trough stretching
across the Mississippi Valley). The ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET camp are
closest to, yet not weaker than, the ensemble means.  For the
pressures, 500 hPa heights and QPF, stuck closer to this grouping
early (with some GFS inclusion Thursday into early Friday), with
slowly increasing ensemble mean contribution (ECMWF/NAEFS) from
this weekend onward.  The grids will have a more even blend of the
deterministic and ensemble mean guidance, as usual.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The best focus for rainfall to begin the period will be ahead of
the Central U.S. upper trough across the South and East. There is
some signal for at least locally moderate-heavy rainfall from
parts of the Tennessee Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.
Over the southern Plains and vicinity, a lingering front early in
the period and trough late in the period should promote episodes
of showers/storms with heavy rainfall.  The guidance remains wet
near the western Gulf coast in response to likely trough/upper low
across TX next weekend, with the GFS showing a multi-day trend in
that direction as it figures out the details of the northern and
southern stream portions of the upper level trough.  TX and the
northwest Gulf Coast is highly susceptible to any kind of heavy
rainfall given much above normal precipitation over recent weeks
(TX) and months (LA).  Out West, a gradual increase of moisture
over the Northwest is expected as flow aloft trends toward a broad
trough. Some light to moderate totals will be possible over the
Pacific Northwest with some activity also possible over the
northern Rockies and eventually spreading eastward across the
northern tier of the Lower 48.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) across the central and
northern Great Basin will continue into Thursday with both daytime
highs and warm morning lows near or exceeding record values. The
trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat over the West and spread above normal
readings across the northern tier into the Northeast. A handful of
locations in the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley may also
challenge daily records into the weekend. Parts of the Northwest
may actually dip slightly below normal by next Sunday-Monday.
Elsewhere, the southern Plains will tend to see highs up to 5-10F
below normal due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms while the
southern half of the East should see near-normal readings for most
of the period; record high minima are in the cards for portions of
New England this weekend.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 31 2021

SYNOPSIS: Model guidance shows mid-level high pressure established across the
East at the beginning of the forecast period, bringing with it the potential
for record high temperatures for the Northeast. This high pressure is forecast
to lessen over the course of the week, keeping temperatures warm, but less
concerning from a health perspective. Periods of enhanced onshore flow out of
the western Gulf of Mexico have occurred across portions of the Southern
Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley over the last month, with another event possible
at the start of Week-2. Locally heavy rainfall and river flooding may result
across portions of the Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley. Mid-level low
pressure is forecast over the Bering Sea and near the Pacific Coast throughout
Week-2, but given the ongoing dry season for both locations no associated
precipitation hazards are anticipated.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northeast, Tue-Wed, Jun 8-
9.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern and Central Plains,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Central
Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, Tue-Sat, Jun 8-12.

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley, Tue Jun 8.

Flooding possible for portions of East Texas and Louisiana.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 03 - MONDAY JUNE 07:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tH2UyTWMuYLbS9pNn3GV5md_FS3za4HRY6W5agDaa81JGz6LLxTCLynYB0qmeCvjCBnJHdyB$

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 08 - MONDAY JUNE 14: At the beginning of Week-2 consensus
exists among the ensemble means of the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models
regarding anomalous ridging located near Montreal. This setup is likely to
help
drive the 582 dm isohypse into Canada, a sign of potentially record-breaking
heat during early to mid-June for the Northeast. The National Blend of Models
reflects this, despite the substantial forecast lead time, with forecast highs
(and associated daily records) on June 8th of 90F for Burlington, VT (91F),
91F
for Bangor, ME (92F), and 88F for Caribou, ME (87F). Calibrated reforecast
guidance shows a 10-20% chance of record highs from roughly Boston northward,
supporting a moderate risk of excessive heat on June 8th and 9th. Reforecast
guidance also indicates a slight risk of excessive heat stretching from the
Dakotas eastward to the Atlantic, with the southern extent as far south as the
U.S. capital region, for June 8th-12th. With this likely being the warmest
temperatures observed to date during 2021 for the aforementioned regions,
consider a refresher on safety tips to beat the heat found at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!tH2UyTWMuYLbS9pNn3GV5md_FS3za4HRY6W5agDaa81JGz6LLxTCLynYB0qmeCvjCBQfp6CP$ .



Rainfall over the last 30 days ranges from 200-400% of normal across the
western Gulf Coast states as a result of multiple episodes of onshore flow.
Amazingly, portions of this region were under severe drought (D3) as recently
as April 27th. Needless to say, the region is vulnerable to flooding impacts
from subsequent rainfall, and the Weather Prediction Center currently
anticipates another 2 to 5 inches of rain falling here prior to Week-2. This
could lead to possible flooding ongoing at the beginning of Week-2. Reforecast
guidance continues to highlight this region for some degree of heavy rain
potential during Week-2. The best signals in raw guidance appear to be on June
8th across portions of the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley,
resulting in this region being highlighted for a slight risk of heavy rain.
Beyond the 8th the precipitation signals become more transient and weaker in
ensemble guidance, underscoring the likely localized nature of isolated
convection as opposed to synoptic-scale features.



Over the Pacific, the Week-2 mean circulations show anomalous 500-hPa ridging
south of the Aleutians and troughing off of Northern California. Given it's
the
dry season across Alaska and increasing portions of the West, no associated
precipitation hazards are anticipated from this setup. Temperatures for the
West are likely to be near to slightly below-normal in this scenario with
Alaska experiencing temperatures slightly above climatological values.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Mon May 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Similar to Day 1, upper ridging along the West Coast and broad upper
troughing across the central/eastern CONUS is expected to persist
tomorrow. A thermal low will once again become established across
central California, promoting dry onshore flow and some
wildfire-spread potential. Appreciable rainfall accumulations across
the southern CONUS, with calmer winds/moist low-level conditions
across the eastern CONUS, will both serve to hinder significant
wildfire-spread potential. Locally dry and breezy conditions will
also support briefly Elevated wildfire-spread potential across the
Lower Colorado River Valley in terrain-favoring areas given 10-15%
RH and receptive fuels.

...Central California...
As the axis of the upper ridge centers over California tomorrow
afternoon, surface temperatures approaching 100 F by afternoon peak
heating will support thermal low development across the central
California Valley region. 15+ mph downslope flow along the lee of
the Diablo Range will support Elevated conditions across the San
Joaquin Valley given very dry fuels and 10-20% RH. Localized
plume-dominated wildfire potential will again be possible across
much of central California given the very warm temperatures.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JUNE 2021

The update to the June 2021 temperature and precipitation outlooks are driven
primarily by the most recent short-, medium- and extended-range model guidance
as well as the most recently available subseasonal and monthly integrated
forecast products. The MJO has become less coherent in recent weeks and does
not play as much of a role in the updated outlook, while soil moisture
anomalies continued to inform the June temperature outlook.



Changes to the June temperature outlook are generally small overall. The
outlook continues to favor above-normal temperatures in an inverted horseshoe
pattern encompassing areas from the Southwest CONUS to the Pacific Northwest
across the northern Plains and Great Lakes to the Northeast and mid-Atlantic.
Strong ridging anticipated during much of the first half of June increases
odds
for above-normal temperatures for the Northeast, Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic
compared to the mid-month outlook. Also, highest probabilities for above-
normal
temperatures in the western CONUS have been shifted to the northwest and are
now focused in the central Great Basin and western Rockies where ridging and
warmer-than-normal temperatures (some potentially extreme) are likely during
the first week of June.



The most substantial change in the updated June outlook, is the inclusion of
favored below-normal temperatures for the southern Plains, lower Mississippi
Valley and western Gulf coast. The mid-month outlook did note the uncertainty
in this region and potential cooler temperatures with a forecast area of
Equal-Chances (EC) due to negative 500-hPa heights indicative of weakened
sub-tropical ridging and enhanced cloudiness and precipitation. Model guidance
through the end of May 2021 across time scales has become more clear and
increased the likelihood of the conditions described above. Substantial
further
support for this addition is the recent heavy rainfall, especially for parts
of
east Texas and Louisiana, which has maintained or increased anomalously wet
surface conditions across this region. Some minor changes are made in Alaska
in
the update, but forecast confidence is low and only very slight tilts from
climatological odds are depicted for the state.



For precipitation, the updated June 2021 outlook illustrates some minor
adjustments in general from the mid-month outlook. Favored below-normal
precipitation remains for the northern Rockies and Pacific Northwest, but has
been removed from parts of the eastern Southwest and southern High Plains.
Model guidance favors some rainfall early in the month in this region where
normal precipitation totals are relatively low.



In addition to the potential MJO influence noted in the mid-month discussion
below, model guidance across time scales has increased confidence for
above-normal precipitation for a region from Texas to the lower Ohio Valley,
mid-South, Gulf coast, Southeast and lower mid-Atlantic. Greatest odds are for
parts of eastern Texas and Louisiana.



Other minor changes include the addition of a small region of favored
above-normal precipitation for parts of the northern Plains and upper
Mississippi Valley, but confidence is low. High uncertainty due to varying
signals in the available forecast tools across time scales in Alaska has led
to
a forecast of EC for the state of Alaska in the updated June outlook.



*******************************************************************************

******              Previous mid-month discussion below
******

*******************************************************************************



The June 2021 monthly outlook was prepared based on current surface conditions
such as soil moisture and coastal sea surface temperatures (SSTs), potential
impacts from the currently active MJO, dynamical model and statistical
forecast
guidance and newly derived long term trends from the 1991-2020 base period.



La Nina conditions present during the winter and spring months has ended as
both SSTs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean have warmed and coupling to the
atmosphere has weakened. The MJO, however, has been active since mid-March and
has been strong and is starting its third "cycle" around the global Tropics.
The enhanced phase of the MJO is currently centered in the Indian Ocean and is
forecast to continue to propagate eastward to the western Pacific by the
beginning of June. The teleconnection to the mid-latitudes from MJO forcing
during late spring and summer, even during a moderate to strong event, is
typically considerably weaker, has a lower likelihood to occur and impacts
highly variable. For this event, the forecast phase of the MJO at the start of
June would favor above-normal temperatures for the western CONUS based on
composites and statistical forecast tools as well as, but to a considerably
lesser degree below-normal temperatures in the vicinity of the Great Lakes,
the
Ohio Valley and parts of the mid-South. These impacts, however, would be
mainly
during the first 10 days of the month June and impacts based on MJO composites
and other tools are not statistically significant in subsequent MJO phases
thereafter.



Favored above-normal temperatures for the western CONUS from the MJO
perspective is consistent and further supported by overwhelming dynamical
model
forecast guidance, statistical tools, low soil moisture considerations and
positive long term temperature trends. Conflicting and/or weak signals related
to the MJO, dynamical model and statistical guidance, areas of very wet
surface
conditions in addition to favored above-normal precipitation for the month of
June as a whole results in low confidence for the eventual category of June
monthly mean temperatures for the southern Plains, lower Mississippi Valley
and
parts of the Southeast. Equal-chances (EC) for either of the three categories
is forecast in these areas. Above-normal SSTs in the lower Bering Sea favor
above-normal temperatures for southwest Alaska which is somewhat supported by
model forecast guidance. Climate signals were weak for most of the remainder
of
the state.



The June 2021 precipitation outlook favors below-normal precipitation for a
region from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies to the central Rockies
southward to include parts of the state of New Mexico and Texas primarily
based
on consistent dynamical model forecast guidance. Elevated probabilities for
above-normal precipitation is forecast for the western portion of Alaska
supported by model guidance as well as potentially greater moisture
availability for precipitation due to more open and warmer waters in the
Bering
Sea, especially the first half of the month. The likely MJO phase over the
course of the month of June would tend to favor at various times enhanced odds
of above-normal precipitation for the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Ohio Valley.
This along with support from dynamical model guidance and long term positive
precipitation trends favor above-normal monthly total precipitation amounts
for
these areas.

FORECASTER: Jon Gottschalck

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1981 and 2010, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

The next monthly outlook...for Jul ... will be issued on Thu Jun 17 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1981-2010 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 31 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 06 - 10 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast ridging over the
North
Pacific and the Aleutians. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the western
CONUS, and ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the
northeastern CONUS. Southerly low-level surface flow is predicted into the
central and eastern CONUS, around surface high pressure over the Atlantic
Ocean. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean
slightly greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent
model skill.

A predicted trough and negative 500-hPa height anomalies lead to likely below
normal temperatures over the West coast. Below normal temperatures are most
favored over the south-central CONUS, as a trough and storm systems are
predicted to traverse the region. Probabilities of near to above normal
temperatures are enhanced for the remainder of the CONUS under near to above
normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatures are favored for far
south-central Mainland Alaska, while below normal temperatures are forecast
for
northwestern Mainland Alaska and  the Alaska Panhandle, consistent with the
ERF
consolidation forecast tool.

A predicted ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies over the
northeastern
CONU lead to increased probabilities of below normal precipitation for parts
of
the northeastern CONUS. Increased probabilities of above normal precipitation
are indicated over the south-central and southeastern CONUS, related to
potential storm systems associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous
southerly surface flow. Below normal precipitation is likely over most of the
western and north-central CONUS, except for parts of the Pacific Northwest,
where above normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool. Below normal 500-hPa heights lead above normal
precipitation over northern Mainland Alaska, while below normal precipitation
is favored over southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle as well as
the Aleutians due to the predicted positive 500-hPa height anomalies.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 08 - 14 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern is generally forecast to
persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, while ensemble spread
and uncertainty increases. Riding over the North Pacific deamplifies relative
to the 6-10 day period. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF
ensemble mean greater than the NCEP GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to
recent model skill.

The temperature pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week 2 period is
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Below normal temperatures are likely
over the West coast under a predicted trough and negative 500-hPa height
anomalies. Below normal temperatures are most favored over parts of southern
Texas and Louisiana, as a trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse
the region. Probabilities of near to above normal temperatures are enhanced
for
the remainder of the CONUS due to near to positive 500-hPa height anomalies.
Near to below normal temperatures are favored over northwestern Mainland,
while
above normal temperatures are forecast over southwestern Mainland Alaska and
the Aleutians, consistent with the temperature consolidation tool.

The precipitation pattern forecast over the CONUS for the week 2 period is
also
similar to the 6-10 day outlook period. Near to below normal precipitation is
likely over most of the northern CONUS, except for western Washington and
Oregon, where above normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool. Chances of above normal precipitation are
enhanced
over much of the south-central and southeastern CONUS, related to potential
storm systems associated with shortwave troughs and anomalous southerly
surface
flow. Below normal precipitation is favored for Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, due to positive 500-hPa height anomalies.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Warming trend and excessive heat across the western United
States...

...Heavy rain and flash flooding are likely into early Tuesday
morning across portions of central and northern Texas...

...Severe weather will remain possible across the southern High
Plains into mid-week...

...Showers and thunderstorms to slowly spread eastward into the
Lower/Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys through Wednesday...

The upper level pattern across the lower 48 will feature ridging
over the western U.S. while troughing slowly edges east atop the
Great Plains and Mississippi River Valley. The upper pattern will
dictate the weather at the surface, with the western ridging
supporting hot and dry weather for locations west of the
Continental Divide. High temperatures will display a warming trend
through Wednesday for the western third of the nation as the upper
ridge slowly moves east. Excessive Heat Watches/Warnings and Heat
Advisories are already in place across portions of Washington,
Oregon, California and southern Nevada. High temperatures will be
well into the 90s to over 100 degrees on Tuesday and Wednesday for
many out West, with the greatest departures from average high
temperatures (20 to 30 degrees above climatology) occurring in the
Northwest where quite a few record highs are forecast on
Wednesday.

Across the Southern Plains, conditions will remain unsettled in
the vicinity of a slow moving surface low and associated front
that is forecast to slowly move east into the middle of the week.
Above average moisture and weak upper level impulses will help to
support areas of locally strong to severe thunderstorms along with
flash flooding from portions of central and northern Texas into
southern Oklahoma through Tuesday morning. An additional 1 to 3
inches of rain is expected through Tuesday morning across portions
of Texas, but locally higher totals are likely. During the day on
Tuesday and Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms will track
eastward into the Lower/Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys,
bringing both the possibility of severe weather and flash
flooding. Through Wednesday, threats for severe thunderstorms will
remain each day from southwestern Texas into eastern New Mexico
where sufficient wind shear and daytime heating will allow for an
increase in the coverage of severe storms with elevated chances
for large hail and damaging winds.

Clouds and rain will help to keep temperatures over most of the
central to south-central U.S. below average through Wednesday. For
the eastern third of the nation, high pressure will support mostly
pleasant weather and near average temperatures with thunderstorm
chances limited to the coast of the Southeast and Florida through
Tuesday near a weakening frontal boundary. Rain chances are
expected to increase from west to east ahead of the system
approaching from the central U.S. on Wednesday.

...Record warmth likely through Thursday across parts of the
West...

...Heavy rainfall possible for parts of the Southern Plains
Saturday and Sunday...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Most of the guidance shares the theme of a significant upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Thursday-Monday). This means strong ridging over the West to
start the period Thursday will be replaced by a mean trough
reaching the Northwest U.S. by the weekend. Meanwhile, heights are
forecast to rise across the East as mean ridging prevails over the
western Atlantic. Between this however, there remains considerable
spread on what becomes of an initial Plains/Mississippi Valley
trough and a High Plains upper trough (or low). The specifics of
these features will likely have considerable influence on the
distribution and intensity of rainfall over the eastern and
southern portions of the lower 48.

The models and ensembles show good agreement the first couple of
days to warrant a purely operational model blend for Thursday into
early Friday.  After this, the guidance shows general agreement,
outside the GFS (more progressive with systems in the Westerlies
and weaker with an upper low over TX) and the Canadian late (which
becomes somewhat deep/out of phase late with the trough stretching
across the Mississippi Valley). The ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET camp are
closest to, yet not weaker than, the ensemble means.  For the
pressures, 500 hPa heights and QPF, stuck closer to this grouping
early (with some GFS inclusion Thursday into early Friday), with
slowly increasing ensemble mean contribution (ECMWF/NAEFS) from
this weekend onward.  The grids will have a more even blend of the
deterministic and ensemble mean guidance, as usual.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The best focus for rainfall to begin the period will be ahead of
the Central U.S. upper trough across the South and East. There is
some signal for at least locally moderate-heavy rainfall from
parts of the Tennessee Valley into the Mid-Atlantic/Southeast.
Over the southern Plains and vicinity, a lingering front early in
the period and trough late in the period should promote episodes
of showers/storms with heavy rainfall.  The guidance remains wet
near the western Gulf coast in response to likely trough/upper low
across TX next weekend, with the GFS showing a multi-day trend in
that direction as it figures out the details of the northern and
southern stream portions of the upper level trough.  TX and the
northwest Gulf Coast is highly susceptible to any kind of heavy
rainfall given much above normal precipitation over recent weeks
(TX) and months (LA).  Out West, a gradual increase of moisture
over the Northwest is expected as flow aloft trends toward a broad
trough. Some light to moderate totals will be possible over the
Pacific Northwest with some activity also possible over the
northern Rockies and eventually spreading eastward across the
northern tier of the Lower 48.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) across the central and
northern Great Basin will continue into Thursday with both daytime
highs and warm morning lows near or exceeding record values. The
trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat over the West and spread above normal
readings across the northern tier into the Northeast. A handful of
locations in the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley may also
challenge daily records into the weekend. Parts of the Northwest
may actually dip slightly below normal by next Sunday-Monday.
Elsewhere, the southern Plains will tend to see highs up to 5-10F
below normal due to clouds and showers/thunderstorms while the
southern half of the East should see near-normal readings for most
of the period; record high minima are in the cards for portions of
New England this weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0115 AM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level troughing is expected across the central and eastern
CONUS as ridging aloft builds over the West Coast today. Similar to
yesterday, weak surface winds or appreciable rainfall accumulations
will hinder major wildfire concerns east of the Rockies. Along the
West Coast however, hot temperatures will promote at least some
wildfire concerns. Otherwise, locally dry and breezy conditions may
manifest this afternoon across terrain-favoring areas across the
Lower Colorado River Valley.

...Central California...
By afternoon peak heating, 100 F surface temperatures will support
thermal low development across the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valley
areas. By late afternoon, dry downslope flow along the lee of the
Coast Ranges will promote 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
coinciding with 10-20% RH, atop very dry fuels across parts of the
lower Sacramento Valley, Bay Area, and San Joaquin Valley. The very
hot temperatures will also foster plume-dominated wildfire potential
across higher terrain areas. The summation of the aforementioned
favorable wildfire-spread conditions warrants the continuation of
Elevated highlights.

...Record warmth likely through Friday from parts of the West to
the northern Plains...

...Heavy rainfall possible for parts of the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi Valley...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The guidance continues to advertise a substantial upper level
pattern change over the course of the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday). This means strong ridging over much of the
West/Rockies will be replaced by a mean trough spreading into the
West this weekend. Meanwhile, heights are forecast to rise across
the East as mean ridging prevails over the western Atlantic and
some sort of trough/upper low lingers over the Southern Plains.

While the latest suite of models and ensembles show generally good
consensus on the large scale set up, there remains considerable
uncertainty in the details of individual systems. The model
agreement the first half of the period though was sufficient
enough to warrant a purely operational model blend through the
weekend (between the ECMWF, GFS, and UKMET). The CMC continues to
be a bit out of phase with the Southern Plains system, wanting to
maintain troughing (or maybe a closed low) over the Mississippi
Valley, while the ECMWF/GFS/UKMET are more consistent with the
ensemble means. After day 5, models also begin to diverge on what
happens to a cutoff low out of the base of the initial shortwave
into the Northwest this weekend. The latest runs of the GFS/ECMWF
(and UKMET through day 5 at least) drag this feature south off the
California coast, before eventually ejecting back into the
Southwest early next week, possibly getting absorbed back into the
Western mean trough. The CMC however, has been consistent in
showing this low drifting west into the Pacific. Notably though, a
few past operational GFS/ECMWF runs have also showed this
possibility so there's plenty of uncertainty remaining. Thus,
increasing weighting of the ensemble means was used days 6-7 to
help mitigate some detail differences, while also being able to
maintain at least a 50% combo of the ECMWF/GFS which are the
deterministic guidance pieces closest to that of the means right
now.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The biggest concern for heavy rainfall potential will be with the
southern Plains trough/low which should promote daily episodes of
rain and thunderstorms across parts of Texas into the Lower
Mississippi Valley much of the period. The guidance continues to
show the potential for heavy rainfall, across south Texas on
Friday, shifting into East Texas and Louisiana this weekend, with
multi-day rain totals of several inches or more. Although models
continue to show plenty of uncertainty in the details of where and
how much, this region is already highly susceptible to any kind of
heavy rainfall given much above normal precipitation over recent
weeks. Elsewhere, conditions should dry out across the East into
the weekend, with showers lingering over parts of the Southeast.
Out West, a gradual increase of moisture over the Pacific
Northwest is expected, with some activity also possible into the
northern Rockies and eventually the northern tier.

Much above normal temperatures (+15-25F) from the central Great
Basin into the Northern Plains will continue into Friday with
daytime highs near or exceeding record values for some locations.
The trend toward cyclonic flow aloft over the Northwest by next
weekend and rising heights over eastern North America will
gradually suppress the heat across the West and spread above
normal readings into the Great Lakes/Northeast this weekend, with
near record warm morning lows possible for some locations from the
Great Basin into the northern tier states, and the Northeast.
Elsewhere, the Northwest and West Coast may dip marginally below
normal by early next week, while the southern Plains will tend to
see highs up to 5-10F below normal due to clouds and
showers/thunderstorms this weekend. Southern half of the East
should be near normal for much of the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0136 AM CDT Tue Jun 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough across the central CONUS will gradually shift
eastward towards the eastern U.S. as the upper ridge centered over
the West Coast drifts toward the Inter-mountain West tomorrow. A
combination of either showers/thunderstorms, moist low-level
conditions, or weak surface winds will continue to limit widespread,
significant wildfire-spread potential across the central/eastern
U.S. Similar to Day 1, locally dry, breezy conditions may occur over
terrain-favoring areas of the Lower Colorado River Basin tomorrow
afternoon. Also, hot surface temperatures along the West Coast will
support some wildfire-spread potential.

...Central into northern California...
Up to 100 F surface temperatures are expected again across portions
of the San Joaquin Valley and Bay Area. Thermal-low induced
downslope flow along the Coast Ranges will support periods of
overlapping 15+ mph sustained westerly surface winds and 10-20% RH,
necessitating the introduction of Elevated highlights. More
localized, brief Elevated conditions may also occur along the lee of
the Southern Cascades and Klamath Mountains across far northern
California during the late afternoon, as shown by some of the latest
high-resolution guidance. Across much of California, the hot
temperatures will again support some plume-dominated wildfire
potential across higher-terrain areas.

...Record-breaking heat found across the western United States to
start the month of June...

...Flash flooding and severe weather possible across portions of
the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southern Plains today...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms advance eastward into the
Ohio and Tennessee valleys on Wednesday...

The western United States is wasting no time to start
meteorological summer as high temperatures are forecast to soar
well above average from the Desert Southwest to the Pacific
Northwest through at least Thursday. Simmering and record-breaking
heat will be particularly likely today from central California to
northwest Oregon, before expanding into the northern Great Basin
on Wednesday. Highs are expected to reach into the triple digits
across the Sacramento and San Joaquin valleys of California, as
well as portions of southwest Oregon and the Desert Southwest.
High temperatures into the 90s should spread as far north as
central Washington and potentially north-central Montana on
Wednesday. A few locations at risk of experiencing daily record
high temperatures today and Wednesday include: Fresno and Redding,
CA; Medford and Portland, OR; as well as Spokane, WA and Boise,
ID. Excessive Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories have been issued
for areas where heat-related illness is possible if simple
precautions are not taken.

Farther east, a weak area of low pressure currently located over
northeast Texas is forecast to slowly move east-northeast over the
next few days and enter the Ohio Valley by Thursday morning.
Showers and thunderstorms will likely develop along and ahead of
an associated cold front as in influx of moisture streams
northward from the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, severe weather and flash
flooding will remain a concern today across the Lower Mississippi
Valley and portions of the Southern Plains. WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of Excessive rainfall that stretches from southern
Missouri to Louisiana, where chances of downpours leading to flash
flooding are greatest.

By Wednesday, showers and thunderstorms are forecast to shift into
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys, while also lingering throughout
central and southern Texas. A few thunderstorms will be capable of
producing damaging wind gusts and isolated tornadoes between
northern Mississippi and southwest Ohio. Isolated instances of
flash flooding are also an anticipated concern throughout the
aforementioned regions due to high rainfall rates and the
potential for local rainfall amounts over 2 inches.

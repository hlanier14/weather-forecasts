.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0142 AM CST Thu Feb 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
As the strong upper trough moves out of the Great Basin and across
the southern Rockies today, much cooler air will fill in across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Surface pressure gradients will
weaken, but may support occasional gusty winds across southern and
eastern New Mexico. Some low-end fire weather potential will be
possible across eastern New Mexico, though fuels have moderated.

...Eastern New Mexico...
Winds across much of southern and eastern New Mexico will weaken
through the day behind a Pacific front associated with the departing
upper trough. While gradients will weaken, gusty winds of 10-20 mph
will likely linger through the afternoon. Light overnight
precipitation, cloud cover and cooler temperatures should limit
diurnal RH minimums with most of the area expected to be near 15-25%
through peak heating. Widespread overlap of strong winds and dry
surface conditions is not expected. In addition, the colder
temperatures and better RH recoveries overnight will likely moderate
fuel dryness. The overall situation appear to favor only locally
elevated fire weather conditions across portions of southern and
eastern New Mexico for a few hours this afternoon.

next two days, except for the Southeast...


The second major winter storm to affect the nation this week will
be moving from the Tennessee/Ohio Valley region Thursday night to
a position off the New England coast during Friday.   The winter
weather effects currently from this storm across portions of the
Southern Plains into the Mid Mississippi Valley will be
diminishing tonight but increasing from the Great Lakes into the
northeast.  Accumulating snows expected Thursday night from the
Upper Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes, spreading into the
Northeast by early Friday.  The heaviest snows expected from along
the Pennsylvania/New York State border, across much of New York
and much of New England, except northern Maine.  Snow
accumulations in the 6 to 12 inch range possible across these
regions, with lighter totals westward across the Great Lakes into
the Upper Mississippi Valley.   Accumulating ice possible to the
south of the heavy snow region from Ohio into Pennsylvania and
northern and western Maryland, where .10-.25" amounts are
possible.

Farther to the south, heavy rains are possible tonight into the
early morning hours of Friday across portions of the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys.  These regions have received heavy rains over
the past three days, resulting in high stream/river flows and
saturated soil conditions.  The expected additional rains will
pose the threat of additional flash flooding and river flooding.

In the wake of the storm system moving northeastward off the New
England coast on Friday, below average temperatures will stretch
across much of the nation.  The exception to this will be across
portions of the Southern Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where much
above average temperatures are possible.   Record low minimum
temperatures are possible Friday morning from western Oregon,
through much of California and into western Arizona.

By Saturday, much more tranquil weather will dominate the nation
with only some light precipitation amounts developing over the
Southern Plains and moving into the Pacific Northwest.
Temperatures will also begin to moderate on Saturday along the
West coast and from the Northern Plains into the upper Great
Lakes, but remain below average from the Southern Plains into the
Northeast.  Warmer than average temperatures expected again across
the Southeast into Florida on Saturday.

Valid 12Z Sun Feb 27 2022 - 12Z Thu Mar 03 2022

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early through mid next week in transition to less amplified
upper level flow.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
general deterministic model blend through day 5 with less
weighting to the 00z CMC on day 4. Greater weighting given to the
00z UK/EC since they appeared to find a middle ground solution
between the 06z GFS and 00z CMC with respect to a shortwave
propagating through the West on day 5. An ensemble blend, composed
of the 06z GEFS and 00z ECENS/CMCE, as well as a bit of 00z EC and
06z GEFS were utilized on days 6 and 7. Models and ensembles offer
a reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolution, but continue
to offer run to run continuity issues and variance with smaller
scale embedded weather features such as a shortwave trough making
its way through the West on day 4.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will favor drier
conditions. However, a pair of Alberta Clippers will likely
produce periodic light northern tier snows from the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes through the Northeast. Also, expect a swath of
modest precipitation to traverse the Southeast into Sunday/Monday.
This will be mainly be in the form of light to moderate cold rain,
but with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the
swath of precipitation. In addition, a weak atmospheric river
event will to develop over parts of the Pacific Northwest/northern
CA this weekend with slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.
Precipitation totals are forecast to increase over the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA and increasingly spread across the
northwestern states through early and mid next week with upper
trough and associated lead frontal system approach and passage.
This pattern will include locally terrain enhancing heavier snows.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 24 2022

SYNOPSIS: Dynamical models remain in good agreement regarding the mid-level
height pattern across North America during week-2. Mid-level high pressure is
forecast to amplify across the northeastern Pacific and Alaska and mid-level
low pressure is forecast to develop downstream over the western contiguous
U.S.
Surface low pressure is forecast to eject out of the Rockies and track
northeastward early in the period, enhancing wind speeds across the Central
and
Southern Plains, and potentially resulting in snow to the north of the storm
track. A more zonal mid-level flow pattern with above normal mid-level heights
is favored for much of the East, leading to relatively warmer temperatures
compared to the late week-1 timeframe.

HAZARDS

Slight risk for heavy snow for parts of the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi
Valley, and Great Lakes, Fri-Sat, Mar 4-5.

Slight risk for heavy precipitation for parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower
and Middle Mississippi Valleys, southern Great Lakes, Appalachians, and the
Southeast, Fri-Thu, Mar 4-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the western CONUS
and the Northern and Central Plains, Sat-Thu, Mar 5-10.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Central and Southern Plains,
Fri-Sat, Mar 4-5.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, Fri, Mar 4.

Flooding possible across portions of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Middle
Mississippi Valleys.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY FEBRUARY 27 - THURSDAY MARCH 03:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vs5ELtpjYNL3DHW5ue14lziY3-W80C5Nmoo3J1Ehl4KuGE5u_xvr22Dk55S82vnFVyao7oj5$

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 04 - THURSDAY MARCH 10: Today's 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble mean 500-hPa height forecasts favor strong mid-level ridging
expanding
over the Northeastern Pacific and Alaska during week-2, with troughing
indicated over the western CONUS and building mid-level heights downstream. As
a result, anomalously cold temperatures are forecast to develop over parts of
the western CONUS, with above normal temperatures favored across the central
CONUS early in week-2, shifting eastward by the middle of the period. The
forecast 500-hPa height pattern over the CONUS generally mimics the expected
La
Nina response, which is being enhanced by an active Madden Julian Oscillation
(MJO) event over the eastern Indian Ocean. However, there is more uncertainty
late in week-2, and a return to near to below normal temperatures over the
central and northern portions of the CONUS is possible by the end of the
period.



Although the reforecast tools are not overly aggressive regarding the
hazardous
cold potential across the West, the uncalibrated temperature guidance from the
0z ECMWF and GEFS indicate minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F
over parts of the region starting around day-9 (Mar 5) in the ECMWF. The GEFS
is a bit later in terms of timing, but expands the anomalous cold further into
portions of the Northern and Central Plains later in the period. Given that
there are still some model differences related to the exact timing and
placement of the anomalous cold, a broad slight risk for much below normal
temperatures is highlighted over parts of the western CONUS, extending into
the
Northern and Central Plains from Mar 5 through the end of the period. Minimum
temperatures are forecast to range from the single digits deg F across the
highest elevations and near the Canadian Border to near freezing closer to the
Pacific Coast.



The troughing forecast across the western CONUS is also forecast to increase
the potential for surface low pressure development in the lee of the Rockies,
with the 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles all depicting an area of low
pressure tracking northeastward across the Great Plains and Midwest around day
8-9 (Mar 4-5). The ECMWF and Canadian indicate a stronger system compared to
the GEFS, and therefore supports a greater chance of heavy snow along the
northern periphery of the storm track. Uncalibrated guidance from the ECMWF
depicts some areas of the Upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes
having at least a 20% chance for day-8 (Mar 4) snowfall exceeding 4-inches.
Given the improved model agreement compared to yesterday, and the increased
signals for snow, a slight risk for heavy snow is introduced across parts of
the Northern Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, and Great Lakes. A broad area
is
depicted to account for expected model oscillations regarding the exact storm
track and where the heaviest snow potential will set up.



High wind speeds may accompany this system as it moves out of the Rockies,
with
the ECMWF reforecast tool indicating at least a 20% chance of wind speeds
exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 25-mph early in the period
across parts of the Great Plains. Although the signal for high winds in the
GEFS reforecast tool is not as robust, any potential for elevated wind speeds
over the drought impacted areas of the Great Plains has the potential to
increase the wildfire threat over the region, thus a slight risk of high winds
remains posted for Mar 4-5 across parts of the Central and Southern Plains.



In addition to the heavy snowfall potential across the northern tier, a
frontal
feature is also expected to accompany the aforementioned low pressure system,
with increased chances for heavy rainfall over portions of the east-central
CONUS. The overall pattern is likely to continue to be favorable for
additional
disturbances to track across the region given the forecast 500-hPa height
pattern. The ECMWF reforecast tool depicts some areas having at least a 20%
chance of 3-day precipitation exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and
1-inch throughout the period. Although weaker with the surface low early in
week-2, the GEFS comes into better agreement with the ECMWF regarding the
heavy
precipitation signal later in week-2, supporting a slight risk for heavy
precipitation across parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Middle
Mississippi Valleys, southern Great Lakes, Appalachians, and the Southeast for
the entire period. Ongoing river flooding across parts of the Ohio, Tennessee,
and Middle and Lower Mississippi Valleys may be exacerbated with any
additional
precipitation and/or increased snowmelt runoff from areas to the north,
resulting in a flooding possible hazard highlighted over these areas.



During late week-1 all of the models are in agreement regarding deep 500-hPa
troughing and associated surface low pressure forecast over the Bering Sea.
This is likely to result in increased wind speeds across the Aleutians and
southwestern coastal Mainland, which may persist into the start of the week-2
period. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate some areas with at
least a 20% chance wind speeds exceed the 85th climatological percentile and
25-mph (40-mph over parts of the Aleutians) supporting the continuation of the
slight risk for high winds for day 8 (Mar 4). By day 9 (Mar 5), ridging is
forecast to become dominant across Alaska, resulting in a retrogression of the
trough upstream and a weakening pressure gradient, diminishing chances for
high
winds.

are also expected across the Southwest, moderating fuels and
increasing overnight humidity recoveries. The increase in humidity
coupled with a decrease in surface winds across much of the region
will limit fire weather potential Friday. While some locally
elevated fire weather conditions may occur with gusty downslope
winds across eastern New Mexico, widespread fire weather concerns
are not expected.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu February 24 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 02 - 06 2022

Today's model solutions are in general good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An enhanced trough is predicted over the Bering Sea and the
western Aleutians with below normal 500-hPa heights. A ridge and associated
above normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the North Pacific extending
north through Alaska and toward the North Pole. Troughing is forecast over the
northwestern CONUS, leading to predicted below normal heights over the
northwestern CONUS. Above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over the
remainder of the CONUS.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored over the
northwestern CONUS, beneath a mean mid-level trough. There are enhanced
chances
for near to above normal temperatures across the remainder of the CONUS under
near to above normal 500 h-Pa heights. Meanwhile, the strong ridge building
across Alaska should  bring above normal temperatures to the entire state,
particularly toward the end of the period, supported by most of the dynamical
forecast tools.

An active storm track ahead of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea
favors increased above normal precipitation probabilities across western
Alaska
and the Aleutians. Predicted mid-level ridging and above normal 500-hPa
heights
favor below normal precipitation over eastern Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle,
parts of the southwestern and southeastern CONUS, while above normal
precipitation is forecast over the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with the
consolidation precipitation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 04 - 10 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to be
dominated by very strong ridging predicted over the North Pacific extending
north through Alaska and toward the North Pole. This ridge is forecast to
continue strengthening and to retrograde west of the mean position for the 6
to
10 day period, stronger, and highly meridional from the mid-latitudes to the
Arctic. Downstream, trouging and associated below normal 500-hPa heights are
predicted over much of the western and central CONUS. Ridging and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over the eastern CONUS.

Enhanced above normal temperature probabilities are favored for all of Alaska
due to mean southerly flow associated with the strong full-latitude ridge.
Chances for above normal temperatures top 60 percent along the western tier of
the state. Meanwhile, increased chances for below normal temperatures are
favored across the western CONUS and parts of the Northern and Central Plains
under the influence of the mean mid-level trough and below normal 500-hPa
heights expected to cover this region. The enhanced chances for warmer than
normal temperatures are likely over most of the eastern CONUS and the Southern
Plains, due to the ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

The broadening trough and resultant storm track will establish increased odds
for above normal precipitation across most areas from the central and northern
Rockies through the southern Plains and into the northeastern CONUS. South and
west of the anticipated mean mid-level ridge, below normal precipitation is
favored for parts of the Florida Peninsula  and along the western and
southwestern fringes of the CONUS. Meanwhile, near and west of the strong
ridge
over Alaska,  a stormy pattern is expected to continue into week-2 in the
expected humid, southerly flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
general good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation
pattern,
offset by some disagreement in the forecast temperature and precipitation
fields in the forecast tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early through mid next week in transition to less amplified
upper level flow.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
general deterministic model blend through day 5 with less
weighting to the 00z CMC on day 4. Greater weighting given to the
00z UK/EC since they appeared to find a middle ground solution
between the 06z GFS and 00z CMC with respect to a shortwave
propagating through the West on day 5. An ensemble blend, composed
of the 06z GEFS and 00z ECENS/CMCE, as well as a bit of 00z EC and
06z GEFS were utilized on days 6 and 7. Models and ensembles offer
a reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolution, but continue
to offer run to run continuity issues and variance with smaller
scale embedded weather features such as a shortwave trough making
its way through the West on day 4.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will favor drier
conditions. However, a pair of Alberta Clippers will likely
produce periodic light northern tier snows from the Upper
Midwest/Great Lakes through the Northeast. Also, expect a swath of
modest precipitation to traverse the Southeast into Sunday/Monday.
This will be mainly be in the form of light to moderate cold rain,
but with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the
swath of precipitation. In addition, a weak atmospheric river
event will to develop over parts of the Pacific Northwest/northern
CA this weekend with slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.
Precipitation totals are forecast to increase over the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA and increasingly spread across the
northwestern states through early and mid next week with upper
trough and associated lead frontal system approach and passage.
This pattern will include locally terrain enhancing heavier snows.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CST Fri Feb 25 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire-weather concerns will generally remain low through the period,
as cold surface ridging and below average temperatures persist over
much of the western and central CONUS. The one exception will be
over parts of New Mexico, where breezy southerly surface winds will
develop in response to a weak surface low/trough in the immediate
lee of the southern Rockies. However, minimum RH should generally
remain in the 20-30 percent range where the breezy surface winds are
expected.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CST Fri Feb 25 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will build over the western states, resulting
in dry offshore flow over portions of southern California. Periods
of breezy/gusty northeasterly surface winds (particularly over parts
of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties) may overlap critically low RH
during the morning and afternoon hours. With that said, the brief
nature of these conditions and generally unreceptive fuels cast
uncertainty on the overall fire-weather risk -- precluding
highlights at this time.

Farther east, strong midlevel flow accompanying a shortwave trough
will cross the central Rockies, supporting the potential for
modestly dry and breezy conditions over portions of the central
Plains. However, a limited overlap of the breezy surface winds and
low RH should temper the fire-weather threat. Elsewhere,
fire-weather concerns will generally remain low with high pressure
encompassing much of the CONUS.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 AM EST Fri Feb 25 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Feb 28 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 04 2022

...Overview...

Most guidance expects flow across the lower 48 to have moderate
amplitude next Monday-Friday.  A general western ridge/broad
eastern mean trough pattern through at least midweek should
progress eastward thereafter as a Pacific trough moves into the
western U.S.  Moisture ahead of the Pacific trough will likely
bring meaningful precipitation into the Pacific Northwest with
somewhat lighter amounts eventually spreading across other parts
of the West.  Many areas east of the Rockies will be fairly dry,
with any precipitation generally light and confined to northern
areas with one or more waves and possibly southern parts of the
Plains mid-late week.  Near to above normal temperatures will be
most common next week.  Best potential for below normal readings
will be over/near the southern Plains early in the week and in
northern parts of the eastern U.S. on some days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensemble means offer similar ideas for the overall
pattern evolution through the period but there are some embedded
uncertainties.  Solutions are similar for a leading wave tracking
from the northern Plains through the Great Lakes Monday-Tuesday
but there has been greater spread and run-to-run variability for
the pattern behind it, due to differences in the handling of
central-southern Canada shortwave energy. Faster progression of
the energy leads to more Midwest/eastern U.S. high pressure by
Wednesday-Thursday while slower progression allows for a more
defined surface wave and farther north front.  The preferred
starting point of a 12Z/18Z model composite transitioning to a
model/ensemble mean blend mid-late period introduced a hint of
such a surface wave.  New 00Z runs support existence of this
second wave but with a decent amount of spread.  The other
large-scale consideration is the amplitude and timing of the upper
trough moving into the West.  GFS runs have tended to be on the
flatter/faster side of the spectrum.  The 18Z run was closer to
other models and means (including the GEFS) than the 12Z or new
00Z runs.  The new 00Z ECMWF has trended a little weaker/faster
though.  A number of model runs are suggesting that a trailing
small-scale/low-predictability feature may drop into the mean
trough toward Friday and this would add some complexity to the
forecast.  An intermediate depiction of this trough looks
reasonable at this time.  There will also be a couple southern
tier features with relatively low predictability for specifics, a
weak shortwave crossing the Southeast early in the week and energy
that could briefly close off a low over/near Arizona before
shearing eastward.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect the heaviest precipitation next week to be over the Pacific
Northwest and northern Rockies.  A series of systems embedded in
moist flow ahead of an initially slow-moving eastern Pacific upper
trough may focus periods of locally moderate to heavy rain and
higher elevation snow over these regions early-mid week.  Eventual
progression of the upper trough should bring a lighter trend to
the Northwest and spread precipitation farther south and east
later in the week.  Exactly how far south the moisture reaches
into California and the Great Basin/Rockies will depend on the
amplitude of the upper trough.  Farther east, a couple clipper
systems may bring mostly light snow from the Upper Midwest through
the Great Lakes and Northeast.  Additional northern tier snow will
be possible late in the week ahead of low pressure organizing over
the north-central Plains.  A weak shortwave crossing the Southeast
Monday may produce some light rain before departing.  Another weak
upper feature may generate light/scattered rain over the southern
Plains around mid-late week.

Aside from chilly morning lows over the southern Plains on Monday
(up to 10-15F below normal), the forecast pattern will support
above normal temperatures over a majority of the western and
central U.S. Monday-Wednesday followed by a cooling trend over the
West and a warmer trend over the East.  Plus 10-20F anomalies will
be possible for max and/or min temperatures for one or more days
over the Great Basin/Southwest and parts of the Rockies/Plains.
Areas from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast will tend to stay
below normal though, with some locations in the Northeast 10-20F
below normal early in the week.

...Overview...

Most guidance expects flow across the lower 48 to have moderate
amplitude next Monday-Friday.  A general western ridge/broad
eastern mean trough pattern through at least midweek should
progress eastward thereafter as a Pacific trough moves into the
western U.S.  Moisture ahead of the Pacific trough will likely
bring meaningful precipitation into the Pacific Northwest with
somewhat lighter amounts eventually spreading across other parts
of the West.  Many areas east of the Rockies will be fairly dry,
with any precipitation generally light and confined to northern
areas with one or more waves and possibly southern parts of the
Plains mid-late week.  Near to above normal temperatures will be
most common next week.  Best potential for below normal readings
will be over/near the southern Plains early in the week and in
northern parts of the eastern U.S. on some days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

...A Major Winter Storm impacting areas from the Great Lakes into

will give way to fine and cold conditions over the weekend...

...Increasing chance of precipitation moving into Texas and Deep
South this weekend as well as over the Pacific Northwest...

A low pressure system moving across the lower Great Lakes toward
New England this morning will continue to bring widespread
impactful wintry weather through much of the northeastern U.S.
today into tonight.  The low pressure system is forecast to weak
as a new low pressure center intensifying off the coast of
southern New England gradually takes over as the main storm center
later today.  The area of snow over Great Lakes will quickly
overspread much of New England today, where 6 to more than a foot
of snow is forecast to accumulate before tapering off later
tonight as the new low pressure center moves rapidly away into the
Canadian Maritimes.  Meanwhile, significant amount of ice of up to
a quarter of an inch possible from much of Pennsylvania through
the inland sections of southern New England this morning before
quickly changing over to light snow and ending later today.
Farther south across portions of the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys,
the threat of heavy rain early today will quickly diminish as a
cold and dry air mass takes over behind the departing storm.
Below average temperatures will stretch across much of the nation
by this weekend as a cold high pressure system dominates the
weather pattern.  The exception to this will be across portions of
the southern Mid-Atlantic and Southeast where much above average
temperatures are forecast as the cold front will be slow to move
out to sea.  The trailing portion of the front will become nearly
stationary off the Gulf Coast this weekend.  Moisture is forecast
to return across southern Texas with chance of precipitation
increasing and heading northeast across the Deep South with a
threat of some wintry weather from Arkansas to Tennessee Sunday
morning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Thu Sep 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the Pacific Northwest and central
Rockies as the upper ridge/anticyclone across the interior West
continues to break down tomorrow/Friday. Upper support associated
with the passing mid-level trough will encourage scattered to
widespread thunderstorm development across the western Great Basin
into eastern Oregon and the central Rockies through the entire day
tomorrow. Also, at least locally dry and breezy conditions are
likely across much of the interior West, with more widespread dry
and breezy conditions possible along the lee of the Sierra and
central into eastern Wyoming.

...Interior West - Isolated Dry Thunderstorms...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are expected to be ongoing at
the start of the Day 2 period, mainly across the western Great Basin
into central Oregon. Through the day, the strongest deep-layer
ascent within close proximity to the upper-trough axis will move
eastward towards the central Rockies with a band of scattered to
numerous, predominantly wet storms. While this scenario would not
typically warrant fire weather highlights, an isolated dry
thunderstorm area was introduced since any strikes present on the
periphery of storms would be occurring over fuels that are modestly
to extremely critically receptive to wildfire spread.

...Northwest Nevada...
On the backside of the upper trough, modest mid-level flow will
overspread the Sierra, encouraging downslope flow to the lee of the
higher terrain. Latest guidance consensus suggests 15-25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds may coincide with 20% RH by
afternoon peak heating. Despite the stronger surface winds, some
questions remain if RH can drop to 20% for at least a few hours.
Elevated highlights may need to be removed in future outlooks should
guidance trend cooler and moister to the lee of the Sierra.

...Central Wyoming into the central High Plains...
By mid-afternoon, downslope flow to the lee of the Rockies will
support 15-20 mph sustained westerly surface winds amid 15-20% RH.
Given modestly receptive fuels, Elevated highlights have been
introduced.

..Squitieri.. 09/09/2021

...Tropical Storm Mindy is forecast to move across Georgia this
morning with gusty winds and a period heavy rain before moving out
to sea this afternoon and tonight...

...Scattered thunderstorms slowly move across the Eastern Seaboard
today...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Florida Panhandle through Thursday morning...

...The current heat wave in the western U.S. will shift into the
central High Plains by Friday as scattered thunderstorms move
across the interior northwestern U.S....

A cold front will continue to slowly edge eastward across the
Eastern Seaboard today. Thunderstorms associated with the front
will be scattered along the East Coast and will be slow to exit
the region today.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Mindy that formed
yesterday afternoon in the Gulf of Mexico is moving across Georgia
early this morning, bringing gusty winds and a period heavy rain
to the north of the storm track while scattered thunderstorms
develop south of the track over northern Florida.  The cold front
is forecast to gradually move off the East Coast tonight.  This
will push Mindy off the coast of southeastern U.S. together with
the rain and thunderstorms along much of the East Coast later
tonight.  Over New England a low pressure wave forming along the
front will impede the eastward progress of the front, and thus
keep the rain in the area into Friday.

Elsewhere, an upper-level high over the Great Basin will aid in
producing record high temperatures over the Western States through
Thursday, then over parts of the Central Rockies and the
Central/Southern High Plains on Friday.  Furthermore, the dry
weather associated with the upper-level high will and gusty winds
has led to an increase in the fire weather threat over parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region/Northern Rockies as a Critical
Risk of fire weather is posted. Red Flag Warnings over parts of
the Northwest into the Northern Rockies and Northern High Plains.
In addition, Excessive Heat Warnings are posted over Southeastern
California, southern Nevada, and parts of northwestern Arizona.
Heat Advisories are also issued over most of California. However,
Air Quality Alerts have also been published over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, Idaho, Wyoming, and Colorado due to wildfire
smoke.

...Scattered thunderstorms slowly move across the Eastern Seaboard

...The current heat wave in the western U.S. will shift into the

interior northwestern U.S....

A cold front will continue to slowly edge eastward across the
Eastern Seaboard today. Thunderstorms associated with the front
will be scattered along the East Coast and will be slow to exit
the region today.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Mindy that formed
yesterday afternoon in the Gulf of Mexico is moving across Georgia
early this morning, bringing gusty winds and a period heavy rain
north of the storm track while scattered thunderstorms develop
south of the track over northern Florida.  The cold front is
forecast to gradually move off the East Coast tonight.  This will
push Mindy off the coast of southeastern U.S. together with the
rain and thunderstorms off much of the East Coast later tonight.
Over New England however, a low pressure wave forming along the
front will impede the eastward progress of the front.  This will
help keep the rain in the vicinity into Friday morning before
drier air and clearing skies arrive by Friday afternoon behind a
reinforcing cold front.  The trailing portion of the front will
become nearly stationary across Florida, where a good chance of
thunderstorms will linger for the next couple of days.

Meanwhile, an upper-level high associated with the current heat
wave across much of the western U.S. will shift eastward during
the next couple of days.  Record high temperatures will remain
possible at numerous locations across the interior western U.S.
today.  By Friday, the heat is forecast to overspread the High
Plains as the upper high shifts eastward.  The persistent dry
weather together with gusty winds will continue to raise the fire
weather threat and poor air quality from the interior Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies and into the central High
Plains.  Excessive Heat Warnings and  Heat Advisories remain in
effect over portions of the Mojave Desert as well as parts of the
interior valleys of California.  Changes are on the way as an
upper-level trough is forecast to slide into the Pacific Northwest
on Friday.  Cooler air will be ushered into the region together
with an increasing chance of thunderstorms.  This upper trough
will then head northeastward into the northern Rockies Friday
night where scattered thunderstorms will be triggered.  By
Saturday morning, the thunderstorms should reach into the northern
High Plains as the upper trough interacts with a stationary front.
 Much of the Plains will remain dry.  Only widely scattered
thunderstorms can be found near the Canadian border near/ahead of
a warm front.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu May 20 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR JUNE 2021

The June 2021 monthly outlook was prepared based on current surface conditions
such as soil moisture and coastal sea surface temperatures (SSTs), potential
impacts from the currently active MJO, dynamical model and statistical
forecast
guidance and newly derived long term trends from the 1991-2020 base period.



La Nina conditions present during the winter and spring months has ended as
both SSTs in the equatorial Pacific Ocean have warmed and coupling to the
atmosphere has weakened. The MJO, however, has been active since mid-March and
has been strong and is starting its third "cycle" around the global Tropics.
The enhanced phase of the MJO is currently centered in the Indian Ocean and is
forecast to continue to propagate eastward to the western Pacific by the
beginning of June. The teleconnection to the mid-latitudes from MJO forcing
during late spring and summer, even during a moderate to strong event, is
typically considerably weaker, has a lower likelihood to occur and impacts
highly variable. For this event, the forecast phase of the MJO at the start of
June would favor above-normal temperatures for the western CONUS based on
composites and statistical forecast tools as well as, but to a considerably
lesser degree below-normal temperatures in the vicinity of the Great Lakes,
the
Ohio Valley and parts of the mid-South. These impacts, however, would be
mainly
during the first 10 days of the month June and impacts based on MJO composites
and other tools are not statistically significant in subsequent MJO phases
thereafter.



Favored above-normal temperatures for the western CONUS from the MJO
perspective is consistent and further supported by overwhelming dynamical
model
forecast guidance, statistical tools, low soil moisture considerations and
positive long term temperature trends. Conflicting and/or weak signals related
to the MJO, dynamical model and statistical guidance, areas of very wet
surface
conditions in addition to favored above-normal precipitation for the month of
June as a whole results in low confidence for the eventual category of June
monthly mean temperatures for the southern Plains, lower Mississippi Valley
and
parts of the Southeast. Equal-chances (EC) for either of the three categories
is forecast in these areas. Above-normal SSTs in the lower Bering Sea favor
above-normal temperatures for southwest Alaska which is somewhat supported by
model forecast guidance. Climate signals were weak for most of the remainder
of
the state.



The June 2021 precipitation outlook favors below-normal precipitation for a
region from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies to the central Rockies
southward to include parts of the state of New Mexico and Texas primarily
based
on consistent dynamical model forecast guidance. Elevated probabilities for
above-normal precipitation is forecast for the western portion of Alaska
supported by model guidance as well as potentially greater moisture
availability for precipitation due to more open and warmer waters in the
Bering
Sea, especially the first half of the month. The likely MJO phase over the
course of the month of June would tend to favor at various times enhanced odds
of above-normal precipitation for the Gulf Coast, Southeast and Ohio Valley.
This along with support from dynamical model guidance and long term positive
precipitation trends favor above-normal monthly total precipitation amounts
for
these areas.

FORECASTER: Jon Gottschalck

The climatic normals are based on conditions between 1991 and 2020, following
the World Meteorological Organization convention of using the most recent 3
complete decades as the climate reference period.  The probability anomalies
for temperature and precipitation based on these new normals better represent
shorter term climatic anomalies than the forecasts based on older normals.

An updated monthly outlook... for Jun will be issued on Mon May 31 2021

These outlooks are based on departures from the 1991-2020 base period.

Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu May 20 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

La Nina has ended and ENSO-neutral conditions are present across the
equatorial
Pacific Ocean, as represented in current oceanic and atmospheric observations.
The official CPC ENSO forecast indicates that ENSO-neutral conditions are
likely to persist through the summer.



The June-July-August (JJA) 2021 temperature outlook favors above normal
temperatures for a majority of the CONUS, with the largest probabilities
(greater than 60 percent) forecast across the Southwest. The JJA 2021
precipitation outlook depicts enhanced probabilities of below normal
precipitation amounts across the Pacific Northwest, Rockies, and High Plains.
Above-normal precipitation is slightly more likely across the East, parts of
the Gulf Coast, and much of Alaska. Equal chances (EC) are forecast for areas
where probabilities for each category of seasonal mean temperatures and
seasonal accumulated precipitation amounts are expected to be similar to
climatological probabilities.



BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!oVSVE3VsmylD8deTeN2YAu23Xd9n4B7GJpXOpbRSmaTgivlTYw3FsQhiYJNF4drsyHphEYw0$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions.  During the past four weeks (Apr 18  May 14), sea surface
temperatures (SSTs) were near to slightly below average with SST anomalies
less
than -0.5 degree C across the central and eastern equatorial Pacific. Positive
subsurface temperature anomalies continue to persist at a depth of 50 to 150
meters throughout much of the equatorial Pacific. Integrated upper-ocean heat
anomalies have remained positive since late March. Suppressed convection
diminished during April across the equatorial central Pacific, due in part to
a
robust Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). Since early March the MJO has
completed
two circumnavigations of the global tropics. The enhanced phase of the MJO is
currently over the Indian Ocean and is forecast to continue propagating
eastward to the western Pacific and then Western Hemisphere entering June.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) and the CPC SST consolidation
for the Nino3.4 region depicts ENSO-neutral conditions persisting through
summer 2021. Beyond this time, forecast tools diverge with the CFSv2 featuring
a return of La Nina while other dynamical models such as the ECMWF and
statistical tools maintaining ENSO-neutral conditions. The official CPC/IRI
ENSO outlook indicates that ENSO-neutral conditions are the most likely
outcome
through August-September-October 2021 with probabilities for a return of La
Nina increasing to 55 percent by October-November-December 2021 and continuing
through the winter 2021-2022.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model guidance such as the North American Multi-Model Ensemble
(NMME)
and the Calibration, Bridging, and Merging (CBaM) version of the NMME were
used. The consolidation tool, which includes NMME input and various
statistical
tools, was used as well, especially at later leads. Also, anomalously wet
(dry)
soil moisture conditions were factors in the temperature outlook across
eastern
Oklahoma, eastern Texas, and the lower Mississippi Valley (northern Great
Plains) during June-July-August 2021. At later leads, decadal trends in
temperature and precipitation were the primary tool used in creating the
seasonal outlooks. Slight adjustments to the seasonal outlooks, especially
temperature, were needed due to the change in the 30-year base period from
1981-2010 to 1991-2020.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - JJA 2021 TO JJA 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the forecast
domain during JJA, except for parts of the Midwest where equal chances (EC) of
below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast. This EC area is due to
a weaker signal among temperature tools coupled with poor skill historically
from the NMME during the summer months. Positive decadal temperature trends
and
low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile) support the largest probabilities
(above 60 percent) for above normal temperatures across the Southwest.
Compared
to the previous month, probabilities for above normal temperatures are
decreased from eastern Texas to the lower Mississippi Valley where recent
heavy
to excessive rainfall resulted in soil moisture exceeding the 70th percentile.
In addition, the June temperature outlook calls for EC for that region. Above
normal temperatures are favored throughout Alaska during JJA, but the largest
probabilities (above 50 percent) were shifted from northern Mainland Alaska to
the Aleutians based on the latest model guidance and recent SST anomalies.



Beginning in JAS through SON 2021, above normal temperatures are favored
through the entire CONUS with the largest probabilities (above 50 percent)
consistent with NMME dynamical model guidance and decadal trends. Although
probabilities for above normal temperatures were reduced slightly across the
North Slope of Alaska during SON and OND 2021 due to the new base period of
1991-2020, probabilities are larger compared to the remainder of Alaska.
Seasonal temperature outlooks during the winter 2021-2022 and continuing
through the summer 2022 are based on the CPC consolidation tool and decadal
trends.

PRECIPITATION

Model guidance remains consistent from previous months depicting elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest,
northern
Rockies, and northern to central high Plains during JJA. Based on good
agreement among the latest dynamical models, this favored area of below normal
precipitation was expanded to include the southern high Plains and New Mexico
during JJA and JAS. Due to a notable drying trend among the inputs to the NMME
and C3S along with the consolidation tool, below normal precipitation is
slightly favored for the desert Southwest through SON 2021. This favored
dryness coincides with the monsoon, a wet time of year for the Southwest. The
predicted MJO evolution is likely to provide a favorable large-scale
environment for the development of an early season tropical cyclone in the
Gulf
of Mexico during June. This expectation along with it being a non-El Nino
summer and fall support slightly elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation along parts of the Gulf Coast and Southeast. The favored area of
above normal precipitation across the remainder of the eastern U.S. from JJA
through ASO 2021 is related more to decadal trends. Based on the latest
dynamical models, the coverage of elevated probabilities for above normal
precipitation are increased to include more of mainland Alaska during JJA and
JAS 2021.



Although the NMME begins to favor below normal precipitation across the
southern tier of the CONUS during OND 2021, the precipitation outlook
maintains
EC at this time range due to large uncertainty on the return of La Nina. This
will be reassessed during subsequent seasonal outlooks as we draw closer to
the
fall and winter 2021-2022 when confidence in the state of ENSO is likely to
improve. Seasonal precipitation outlooks during the winter 2021-2022 and
continuing through the summer 2022 are based on the CPC consolidation tool and
decadal trends.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1158 AM CDT Thu May 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
GREAT BASIN...

No changes. Widespread winds of 25 to 30 mph are already present
across much of the critical area and are expected to strengthen
further through the day.

..Bentley.. 05/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1230 AM CDT Thu May 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery reveals an upper-level trough
beginning to deepen and dig southward into northern California. This
feature will continue to shift southward through the day,
maintaining southwesterly flow from southern California into the
Great Basin and northern Rockies. This will also contribute to the
deepening of a surface low over the northern Rockies throughout the
day, which will tighten the pressure gradient over the southwestern
U.S. The combination of increasing winds and antecedent dry
conditions will support another day of critical fire weather
conditions across much of the Southwest. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
rain chances and generally weak low-level flow will limit additional
fire weather concerns.

...Southern Great Basin and northern Four Corners...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions remain likely again
today from southern NV eastward into the Four Corners region.
Sustained surface winds between 20-30 mph are expected, and frequent
gusts up to 35-45 mph (and perhaps upwards of 50 mph for a few
locations) are probable as the general pressure gradient strengthens
over the region. Regional 00 UTC soundings show a very dry boundary
layer in place across the region and overnight RH recovery has been
poor (RH values in the teens and low 20s). These factors, combined
with little moisture recovery and mostly clear skies today, will set
the stage for another day of RH values 5-15% over a region with
receptive fuels.

Although eastern UT and western CO received precipitation over the
past 24 hours, MRMS estimates suggest this rainfall was fairly light
and scattered, and likely did little to moisten fuels. Furthermore,
several lightning strikes were noted across the region that may
become active this afternoon as dry/windy conditions become
prevalent. Elevated fire weather conditions will likely extend into
central NM and the central High Plains, but recent rainfall has
sufficiently mitigated fuel readiness across this region.

...California's Central Valley...
Northerly down-valley winds are expected to gradually increase to
15-20 mph through the day as the regional pressure gradient
strengthens. While overnight RH recoveries are slightly better than
areas to the east across the southern Great Basin, diurnal heating
and boundary-layer mixing will likely yield afternoon RH values in
the teens as mid-level dry air mixes downward. 10-hour fuels across
the region are generally dry with fuel moisture values between 3-7%,
which will support at least elevated fire weather conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 20 2021

SYNOPSIS: Model guidance and reforecast tools continue to maintain an elevated
potential for heavy precipitation and possible flooding throughout portions of
the Great Plains and the Mississippi Valley. Over Alaska, onshore flow is
expected to bring above-normal precipitation to portions of the southern
Mainland and Panhandle during week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Central and Southern
Plains, and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Fri-Tue, May 28-Jun 1.

Flooding possible for parts of the eastern Texas and the Lower Mississippi
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 23 - THURSDAY MAY 27:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!s0JJhp2ur4cOlQZudvziMmvNu25aG7--b3gB_9CKnjl6INBX8jGKaGNoGErOrDXCBlLy5Yjg$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 28 - THURSDAY JUNE 03: A fairly weak 500-hPa height pattern
remains on display in the dynamical models over the CONUS throughout week-2,
though there are a number of differences between the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensemble mean forecasts that introduces uncertainty, particularly with respect
to anomalous temperatures in today's outlook. While both models feature
mid-level ridging over the Eastern Pacific, the ECMWF favors a more northerly
mean solution of this feature, with more downstream anomalous troughing over
portions of the Rockies and north-central CONUS compared to the GEFS early in
the period. By day 10 (May 30), both models agree in the development of
positive height departures overspreading the northwestern CONUS to bring
warmer
and drier conditions to that part of the country, however the GEFS is more
robust in extending these heights and the accompanying warm temperatures into
the Four Corners region. Farther east, the 0z GEFS favors more of a zonal
mid-level pattern over the Southeast, whereas the ECMWF maintains a larger
coverage of positive height departures to sustain unseasonably warm
temperatures over much of the Eastern Seaboard throughout week-2.



By the outset of week-2, surface low pressure and frontal activity continues
to
be favored across the Plains, with southerly flow favoring Gulf moisture
advection to increase the potential for heavy precipitation over the Plains
and
Mississippi Valley. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to
support a slight risk of heavy precipitation with at least a 20% chance of
3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch across
the many parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley through the middle of the
outlook period (May 28 to Jun 1). Compared to yesterday, higher probabilities
are indicated in the ECMWF reforecast tool across the Midwest and the slight
risk area is slightly expanded to account for this prediction. Of particular
concern is the heavy precipitation threat that remains across the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley. Much of Texas is now registering
streamflow values in the highest percentiles due to persistent enhanced
precipitation where many areas have experienced more than twice their normal
rainfall accumulation since late April. With above-normal rainfall also
possible during week-1, there is a continued risk of localized flooding and
river inundation mainly across parts of southern Oklahoma, eastern Texas and
the Lower Mississippi Valley. A possible flooding hazard remains issued over
these areas as the observed minor to moderate river flooding may persist into
week-2.



Over Alaska, there is good agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
favoring anomalous troughing over the Aleutians to bring onshore flow and
above-normal precipitation across the southern Mainland and the Panhandle.
Although reforecast tool guidance shows pockets of 3-day precipitation amounts
exceeding the 85th percentile over the southern Mainland, these amounts are
not
likely to exceed hazardous thresholds, and no corresponding hazards are
issued.

0119 PM CDT Thu May 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN ARIZONA AND
SOUTHERN UTAH...

Extended the elevated delineation northeastward across northeast New
Mexico into southeast Colorado. Recent rainfall and greenup has
rendered most of these fuels moist, but very dry and very windy
conditions are forecast (Sustained 30 mph and 10% relative humidity)
which could support some fire threat, especially in local regions
which have received less rainfall recently.

..Bentley.. 05/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0128 AM CDT Thu May 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough currently digging into northern California is
forecast to gradually shift into southern NV by Friday afternoon.
The slow progression of this wave will continue to place strong mid
and upper-level flow over the Southwest where conditions have been
dry. A surface low lingering over the central Rockies is forecast to
be weaker compared to previous day, but will still maintain a
sufficient pressure gradient to support fire weather concerns for
parts of the Southwest that do not see precipitation during the
afternoon hours.

...Utah and Arizona...
Portions of southern UT and northern AZ are expected to reside
within the dry slot of the synoptic low as it slowly moves east
through the day. While cloud cover and precipitation chances across
the Four Corners will limit the spatial extent of the fire weather
concern, strong mid-level flow within the dry slot and a lingering
surface low across the UT/WY/ID region will support dry and windy
conditions Friday afternoon. Sustained surface winds between 20-30
mph with frequent gusts up to 35-45 mph appear likely as
boundary-layer mixing increases through the day. 5-15% RH values are
expected from southern AZ into central UT, and fuel conditions will
remain supportive of wildfire spread. The eastern and western extent
of the fire weather threat is somewhat uncertain due to rain chances
and the approach of a cold front (respectively), but confidence in
critical conditions for the AZ/UT region remains high.

...Central to Southern New Mexico...
Lee troughing along the central to northern High Plains will result
in 15-20 mph winds across much of NM and adjacent portions of west
TX. Downslope warming and drying of low-level parcels emanating out
of southern AZ will result in widespread RH values in the 10-20%
range. While elevated wind/RH combinations are possible across much
of the southern High Plains, the fire weather threat will be
confined to areas of NM that have not recently received wetting
rainfall and have low rain chances Friday afternoon.

...California's Central Valley...
Northerly down-valley winds will persist into Friday afternoon
thanks to a generally static synoptic pattern. As with Thursday,
relative humidity values will likely fall into the teens with breezy
winds sustained near 15-20 mph. Little to no rainfall is expected,
which will maintain receptive fine fuels.

Valid 12Z Sun May 23 2021 - 12Z Thu May 27 2021

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic model guidance suite is in
above average agreement through early next week.  By Wednesday,
the GFS becomes more amplified with the northern stream trough
crossing the northern Plains and northern Great Lakes, whereas the
CMC and ECMWF have a more broad solution.  More noteworthy
differences become evident over the eastern Pacific and West Coast
region by the end of the forecast period, and the CMC is out of
phase with the GEFS/EC means with a trough approaching the West
Coast by Thursday.  The WPC medium range forecast was primarily
derived from a UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/EC blend through Tuesday, and then
slightly more of the EC/GEFS means while still maintaining some of
the operational GFS/ECMWF.  The previous discussion is appended
below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sun-Tue)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains southern stream troughing from
short range time scales and localized threat for slow moving
convection with heavy downpours will gradually weaken this weekend
into early next week. Meanwhile, an amplified trough over the West
and dynamic ejection favors some moderate precipitation for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies/High Plains including
elevation snows as enhanced by upslope, especially for the
Northern Rockies. This occurs as regional post-frontal conditions
cool to 10-20F below normal.

Downstream, the focus for precipitation episodes is expected to
increasingly shift toward the north-central states next week, with
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill activity across the
Midwest/Great Lakes over the top of an amplified east-central U.S.
upper ridge and drive backdoor cold fronts from the Northeast to
the Mid-Atlantic. Upper ridge transition and backdoor fronts
suggests a transition of lead much above normal temperatures from
the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic to the South/Southeast where some
record high minimum and maximum values will be possible with
temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Upstream, less certain upper troughing with mainly modest
amplitude/precipitation may dig renewed over the Northwest/West
early-mid next week. Guidance has not been as stellar with run to
run variance for these features.

18Z Update:  The 12Z deterministic model guidance suite is in
above average agreement through early next week.  By Wednesday,
the GFS becomes more amplified with the northern stream trough
crossing the northern Plains and northern Great Lakes, whereas the
CMC and ECMWF have a more broad solution.  More noteworthy
differences become evident over the eastern Pacific and West Coast
region by the end of the forecast period, and the CMC is out of
phase with the GEFS/EC means with a trough approaching the West
Coast by Thursday.  The WPC medium range forecast was primarily
derived from a UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/EC blend through Tuesday, and then
slightly more of the EC/GEFS means while still maintaining some of
the operational GFS/ECMWF.  The previous discussion is appended
below. /Hamrick

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium-range product suite was derived days 3-5 (Sun-Tue)
from a composite of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and
12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models in a pattern with above normal predictability. By days
6-7, the GEFS/ECENS means were added to the blend consistent with
slowly increasing forecast spread. WPC continuity is well
maintained and is in line with latest 00 UTC guidance.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Lingering south-central Plains southern stream troughing from
short range time scales and localized threat for slow moving
convection with heavy downpours will gradually weaken this weekend
into early next week. Meanwhile, an amplified trough over the West
and dynamic ejection favors some moderate precipitation for the
north-central Intermountain West/Rockies/High Plains including
elevation snows as enhanced by upslope, especially for the
Northern Rockies. This occurs as regional post-frontal conditions
cool to 10-20F below normal.

Downstream, the focus for precipitation episodes is expected to
increasingly shift toward the north-central states next week, with
scattered strong thunderstorms down through the Plains. This
occurs as ample ejecting western U.S. trough energies interact
with wavy boundaries. Energies will spill activity across the
Midwest/Great Lakes over the top of an amplified east-central U.S.
upper ridge and drive backdoor cold fronts from the Northeast to
the Mid-Atlantic. Upper ridge transition and backdoor fronts
suggests a transition of lead much above normal temperatures from
the Midwest and the Mid-Atlantic to the South/Southeast where some
record high minimum and maximum values will be possible with
temperature anomalies 10-20F above normal.

Upstream, less certain upper troughing with mainly modest
amplitude/precipitation may dig renewed over the Northwest/West
early-mid next week. Guidance has not been as stellar with run to
run variance for these features.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu May 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 26 - 30 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa pattern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a  500-hPa trough over the Aleutians and anomalous
ridging over eastern areas of the North Pacific, extending through eastern
Mainland Alaska. Downstream, a trough is forecast over the western CONUS, and
enhanced ridging is predicted over the southern central and eastern CONUS.
Near
normal heights are forecast over much of the western CONUS, associated with
the
predicted trough. Above normal heights are predicted over the Alaska Panhandle
and Pacific Northwest, where ridging over the North Pacific has moved slightly
eastward into North America, relative to yesterdays forecasts. Above normal
heights are also predicted from the Southern Plains extending across most of
the eastern CONUS, under the ridging over the eastern half of the CONUS.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of western
and northern Alaska associated with enhanced southerly flow. Troughing favors
near to below normal temperatures for much of the western third of the CONUS,
extending across the Northern Plains into the western Great Lakes region. A
broad ridge predicted over the southern central and eastern CONUS favors above
normal temperatures for these regions, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool.

A predicted trough over the Bering Sea and associated onshore flow leads to
increased chances of above normal precipitation for southwestern Alaska and
the
Alaska Panhandle. Anomalous northerly flow and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies lead to increased probabilities of below normal precipitation for
northern areas of the West Coast. Near to below normal precipitation is also
favored for the Southwest CONUS and southern High Plains, supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool. Increased probabilities of above normal
precipitation are indicated for parts of northern High Plains, and from the
Great Plains across the Central and Upper Mississippi Valley into the Midwest,
ahead of predicted mean troughing. Enhanced ridging increases probabilities of
below normal precipitation over the Southeast, the Mid-Atlantic, and the
Northeast Atlantic coast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by differences among
the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 28 - JUN 03, 2021

During the week-2 period, the circulation pattern over the CONUS is generally
forecast to shift slightly eastward and become less amplified compared to the
6-10 day period. Troughing over the Aleutians shifts eastward relative to the
6-10 day period. Above normal heights extend into the northern West Coast from
the eastern North Pacific. A weakening 500-hPa trough is forecast across the
western CONUS with near to slightly above normal heights, while ridging is
forecast over most of the eastern CONUS with weak positive 500-hPa height
anomalies.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of western
and northern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians associated with the trough and
enhanced mid-level southerly flow. Below normal temperatures are favored for
parts of the south coast of Mainland Alaska, associated with cloud cover due
to
onshore flow. Weak troughing over the western CONUS leads to uncertainty among
temperature tools. As a result, near normal temperatures are favored over a
large area of the interior western CONUS. Below normal temperatures are
favored
over parts of the western Great Lakes, associated with high latitude
troughing,
and over parts of extreme southern California and Arizona, as supported by the
temperature consolidation tool. Above normal heights over the northern West
Coast increase the probability of above normal temperature there. Elevated
chances of above normal temperatures are forecast from parts of the Central
Plains across most of eastern CONUS associated with ridging and consistent
with
the temperature consolidation.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across southwestern
Alaska, and the southern coast and Alaska Panhandle, due to onshore flow. Near
to below normal precipitation is predicted over much of the western CONUS,
under increasing influence of the predicted ridge over the eastern North
Pacific. Chances of above normal precipitation are slightly enhanced over the
Great Plains, Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes, and much of the eastern
CONUS, excluding the Gulf Coast, related to potential storm systems ahead of
troughing to the west and anomalous southerly flow and consistent with the
precipitation consolidation tool. Below normal precipitation is favored for
the
Gulf Coast and Florida due to predicted ridging.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
good agreement among models on the overall circulation pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty, weak anomalies, and differences among the temperature
and precipitation forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

Valid 00Z Fri May 21 2021 - 00Z Sun May 23 2021

...Even more rainfall could cause additional flooding and flash
flooding for eastern Texas into Louisiana...

...Thunderstorms are expected over parts of the central U.S., with
severe weather possible in the Northern/Central High Plains
through tonight...

...Late-season snow will continue across higher elevations of the
West, with well over a foot of snow likely in the Northern
Rockies...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the Central Great Basin and Southwest...

Ample moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will continue streaming
into the central U.S. over the next few days, and upper-level
energy moving from the Plains to the Midwest should continue to
trigger showers and thunderstorms over the region. Additional
rainfall totals of up to 3 inches are possible for southeastern
Texas into parts of Louisiana, which have already seen several
days of heavy rain, and flooding is ongoing in some areas. The
next rounds of rain should serve to exacerbate ongoing flooding
and could lead to numerous instances of flash flooding. A Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall is in place through tonight, and Flash
Flood Watches are in effect along the western/central Gulf Coast.
Lessening rain totals by Friday, but still some modest rainfall
potential, has led to a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in place
for Friday for southeastern Texas and southwestern Louisiana.

A deep upper-level low is forecast to drop slowly southward across
the West and persist there over the next couple of days. This
feature providing lift combined with a frontal system moving
slowly across the north-central U.S. will lead to scattered
showers and thunderstorms across the Northern/Central Plains and
Midwest. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in place through
tonight for northern and central parts of the High Plains mainly
for wind and hail threats. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms
are possible for the Mississippi Valley as well. Additionally,
isolated flash floods are possible for eastern North
Dakota/northwestern Minnesota through tonight where locally heavy
rain could occur if thunderstorms train over the same area.

Underneath the upper low, temperatures are expected to be
substantially below normal over the West. High temperatures are
forecast to be more than 30 degrees below average for portions of
Montana, with temperature anomalies of 20 degrees below normal
common for the Intermountain West. These cold temperatures will
support lowering snow levels across the West, so snow is likely
for the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, and higher elevations of the
Intermountain West. But the greatest snow totals are expected in
the Northern Rockies, and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect for
portions of Montana where snow totals should be well over a foot.

Meanwhile, the upper-level pattern will support gusty winds across
the interior West, and combined with dry conditions, fire danger
will continue. Critical Risks of fire weather are delineated for
much of the Central Great Basin and Southwest through Saturday,
and the interior valleys of California and the Southern High
Plains are under Elevated Risks as well. Elsewhere, the
northeastern U.S. can expect increasing chances for showers and
thunderstorms for the end of the week along a meandering front.
Warmer than average temperatures are forecast to continue for the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next
several days, with highs rising well into the 80s and even into
the 90s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Fri May 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL
UTAH...

...Synopsis...
The upper trough in the West will move slowly eastward today. The
ridge across the east will generally remain in place with some
modest intensification during the day. Fire weather concerns will
again be primarily focused in the parts of the Great Basin and
Southwest.

...Northern Arizona into Utah...
The mid-level jet is forecast to intensify across the region during
the afternoon. Very dry and windy conditions will develop,
particularly within lower elevations. Some locations will have RH
that approaches 5% with the broader region more likely to see
10-15%. Winds of 20-30 are expected. Locally higher winds may also
occur. Potential precipitation and cloud cover will limit concerns
to the east with an approaching cold front limiting concerns to the
west.

...California Central Valley...
A modest northerly pressure gradient will combine with strong
along-valley flow aloft to elevated fire weather concerns during the
afternoon. RH of 15-20% will overlap with 15-20 mph winds. Dry
fuels/very high ERCs will support fire spread.

...Southern/eastern New Mexico into southeast Colorado...
Strong surface winds are expected to develop west of the lee trough.
Winds will reach 15-20 mph across much of southern/central New
Mexico. Higher wind speeds (20-30 mph) are possible farther north
into Colorado given the proximity to the mid-level jet and surface
low. Fuels will be driest with southern extent, but critical
meteorological conditions over more modestly receptive fuels to the
north will still elevate concerns.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
Under the influence of an upper ridge, much of Florida has seen
little rainfall over the past week. ERCs in much of the Peninsula
have risen above the 90th percentile with the west-central coast
above the 97th percentile. Recent large fire activity further
suggests available fuels. During the day, the ridge aloft will
intensify across the Southeast and lead to enhanced easterly winds
across the Peninsula. 10-15 mph winds appear probable with the
potential for higher wind gusts. RH will is expected to drop to
25-35% along and near the coast during the afternoon. Fire weather
concerns will be elevated to near critical.

...Record heat likely for portions of the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic next week...

...Overview...

Upper lows in the Bering Sea and near the Davis Strait favor a
trough/ridge pattern across the lower 48 next week. This will
maintain a cool and showery (even snowy) regime over the interior
West behind a frontal system moving ashore early in the week. Over
the East, ridging will promote hot and dry conditions over the
Southeast with record highs well into the 90s to around 100F. A
backdoor front may cool some areas of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic
in the otherwise very warm pattern. Rainfall will be focused over
the Plains and northern tier until a cold front pushes
southeastward late in the week.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, the deterministic models formed a
reasonable blended solution despite their differences in timing
into the West early in the week. The GFS runs have been generally
quicker but within the ensemble spread, and this was balanced by
the slower ECMWF/Canadian. To the east, quicker trend in all the
guidance with low pressure through southern Canada (and warm
fronts just over the border), but less change near the inflection
point between the backdoor cold front into NC Mon-Tue. By later in
the week, relied on 50/50 model/ensemble blend, as the West will
likely see smaller wavelength features dive through/into the broad
trough, but predictability is low. In the East, still expect high
pressure out of Canada to help push the cold front southeastward
into the Carolinas by late next Thu into next Fri, lingering the
boundary across the Plains.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Highest chances of rainfall next week will like over the central
Plains to the Midwest as well as the interior Northwest/northern
Rockies. Incoming front into the Pacific Northwest and the
slowly-moving cold front out of the northern Plains will touch off
light to modest showers and perhaps some thunderstorms east of the
Rockies. Some snow is possible over the highest elevations, with
snow levels lowering a bit underneath the upper trough. Amounts
have the potential to be locally heavy in some
convectively-enhanced areas (over the Plains) along the frontal
boundary. Backdoor cold front in the East may bring only light
showers to some areas. By later in the week, approaching cold
front could support more organized showers and perhaps a storm.

Temperatures will be cool in the West, warm/hot in the East, and
within several degrees of normal in between. Coldest anomalies in
the West may be early in the week  where readings of 5-15F below
normal will moderate a bit to about 5 degrees below normal by the
end of the week. In the East, ahead of the backdoor cold front (or
behind the warm front as it advances back to the northeast),
temperatures may climb to 10-20F above normal. This will bring
80s/90s into the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic and 90s to near 100F over
the Southeast. Records highs are likely for some areas and could
be widespread over several states Mon-Wed. Heat indices may be
kept in check by dew points in the 50s/60s through the week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA AND WESTERN NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The western upper-level trough will continue to make eastward
progress on Saturday. Strong mid-level winds will remain across
parts of the Great Basin and Southwest. A surface trough in the Four
Corners will bring another day of critical fire weather to parts of
Arizona and New Mexico.

...Eastern Arizona and western New Mexico...
The mid-level jet will remain overhead during the day. An
intensifying surface pressure gradient will combine with strong
mid-level winds mixing to the surface to produce 20-25 mph winds in
the AZ/NM border vicinity. RH will be lowest in the valleys, with
most areas seeing around 10-15%. Critical fire weather conditions
are expected in these areas. Within the higher terrain, confidence
in critical fire weather will be lower given potential precipitation
on Friday and higher RH values on Saturday. Away from the mid-level
jet core, elevated conditions will be possible into eastern Utah and
western Colorado. Lighter winds (15-20 mph) will overlap with 15-20%
RH to produce elevated fire weather conditions.

...Western Florida Peninsula...
A somewhat similar atmospheric pattern to Friday will exist on
Saturday. Easterly winds and relatively dry conditions are expected
during the afternoon. While some locally elevated conditions are
possible near the coast, the surface ridge moving overhead is
expected to weaken the gradient enough such that wind speeds will be
too light for highlights.

...Additional heavy rain associated with a developing low pressure
center over the western Gulf of Mexico could impact areas from
Texas Gulf Coast to Louisiana today followed by eastern Texas
tonight...

...Thunderstorms could become severe ahead of a cold front through
the High Plains for the next couple of days...

...Late-season snow will linger across higher elevations from the
Sierra Nevada to the northern Rockies into the weekend...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the central Great Basin and Southwest...

Southeasterly winds circulating around a large high pressure
system centered over the northeastern U.S. will continue to direct
a stream of tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico toward the
western Gulf states.  Meanwhile, latest observations indicate that
a low pressure center is forming in the western Gulf of Mexico as
it begins to move northward toward the western Gulf Coast.  The
National Hurricane Center is monitoring this area for the
potential for tropical cyclone formation.  Heavy rain ahead of
this developing circulation continues to move across coastal
Louisiana early this morning.  Additional heavy rain could impact
areas from the Texas Gulf Coast to Louisiana today as the
developing low pressure center moves toward the western Gulf
Coast.  The continued threat of heavy rain will keep a Slight to
Moderate Risk of flash flooding over southern Louisiana to the
upper Texas coast today.

A deep upper-level low is forecast to drop slowly southward across
the West and persist there over the next couple of days. This
feature providing lift combined with a frontal system moving
slowly across the north-central U.S. will lead to scattered
showers and thunderstorms across the Northern/Central Plains and
Midwest. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in place through
tonight for northern and central parts of the High Plains mainly
for wind and hail threats. Isolated strong to severe thunderstorms
are possible for the Mississippi Valley as well. Additionally,
isolated flash floods are possible for eastern North
Dakota/northwestern Minnesota through tonight where locally heavy
rain could occur if thunderstorms train over the same area.

Underneath the upper low, temperatures are expected to remain
below normal over the West. High temperatures are forecast to be
more than 30 degrees below average for portions of Montana, with
temperature anomalies of 20 degrees below normal common for the
Intermountain West. These cold temperatures will support lowering
snow levels across the West, so snow is likely for the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, and higher elevations of the Intermountain West.
But the greatest snow totals are expected in the Northern Rockies,
and Winter Storm Warnings are in effect for portions of Montana
where snow totals should be well over a foot.

Meanwhile, the upper-level pattern will support gusty winds across
the interior West, and combined with dry conditions, fire danger
will continue. Critical Risks of fire weather are delineated for
much of the Central Great Basin and Southwest through Saturday,
and the interior valleys of California and the Southern High
Plains are under Elevated Risks as well. Elsewhere, the
northeastern U.S. can expect increasing chances for showers and
thunderstorms for the end of the week along a meandering front.
Warmer than average temperatures are forecast to continue for the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next
several days, with highs rising well into the 80s and even into
the 90s.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1140 AM CDT Wed May 11 2022

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHWEST AND HIGH
PLAINS...

The previous forecast remains valid with minor changes for the
latest guidance. The IsoDryT area was trimmed slightly westward to
better account for the initiation of dry thunderstorms in the
vicinity of the diffuse dryline across the southern High Plains. The
eastern edge of the Critical area was also adjusted to the west to
avoid greater precipitation chances farther east. Otherwise, please
see the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 05/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Wed May 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will amplify and progress across the central
Rockies today, encouraging the development of surface lows in the
Four Corners region and across the central High Plains. The net
result will be widespread surface conditions conducive to
significant wildfire spread. Closer to the dryline in the southern
High Plains, a few lightning flashes may occur outside of storm
cores atop dry fuels to support fire ignitions. Meanwhile, a surface
low off of the coast of the Carolinas will drive dry northeasterly
surface flow across the central Florida Peninsula, promoting modest
wildfire spread potential.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the surface low strengthens during the day and the boundary layer
mixes, widespread 15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
amid RH under 15 percent will occur across much of the Southwest
eastward to the Colorado Front Range. While fuels are modestly
receptive to fire spread from the Four Corners westward, 25-30 mph
sustained surface winds will compensate to support Critical
wildfire-spread potential. From central New Mexico into eastern
Colorado, 20-25 mph winds and RH under 10 percent in spots will
foster high-end Critical conditions, supporting rapid wildfire
growth.

A dryline is also expected to meander near the Colorado Front Range
into eastern New Mexico during the afternoon, serving as a forcing
mechanism for thunderstorm development. Some of the initial
thunderstorms may produce strikes away from narrow precipitation
cores into extremely dry fuel beds. In addition, efficient
evaporative cooling from higher-based storms, amid a very buoyant
environment, may also promote erratic surface wind gusts. Isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights have been maintained/expanded where the
greatest chance of dry strikes and subsequent erratic gusts are most
likely. Please view our convective outlook for more details on any
severe threat across the southern High Plains.

...Portions of the Florida Peninsula...
By afternoon peak heating, northeasterly surface winds are expected
to peak into the 10-15 mph range for at least a few hours, when RH
drops to 25-35 percent. Elevated highlights have been maintained
where the aforementioned surface conditions will overlap the
longest, and where forecast fuel ERCs are expected to exceed the
95th percentile.

...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while persistent southern Plains heat
intensifies and expands eastward...
...Record warmth to continue over parts of New England into
Saturday...


...Overview...

A rapidly opening upper low over the East on Saturday (spreading
some rain across the region) will provide the last vestige of the
current blocky pattern over and near the lower 48. Guidance is
consistent in showing the upstream flow settling into a
trough-ridge-trough configuration soon thereafter, with the
eastern Pacific trough axis likely pushing into the West around
the middle of next week as the eastern trough nears the East
Coast. The combination of upper ridging that crosses the West,
persistence of a mean ridge over the southern Plains, and with
time rising heights over the Southeast, should lead to an
expanding area of unseasonably hot weather across the southern
U.S. This heat will challenge daily record highs for multiple days
at some locations. New England may see record heat extend into
Saturday as well. A series of fronts pushed along by the
developing central-eastern U.S. cyclonic flow and extending back
into the Plains will produce episodes of showers and thunderstorms
through the period. At the same time the mean trough eventually
reaching the West Coast should send multiple waves/fronts into
western North America, supporting periods of rain and perhaps very
high elevation snow over the Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains consistent with the overall pattern during
the medium range period, which begins Saturday with a closed upper
low in south-central Canada and the opening low/trough centered to
its southeast, while ridging builds into the interior West and
southern Plains. These features all show good agreement in the
00Z/06Z and newer 12Z models. Somewhat more notable differences
arise as troughing develops across the east-central U.S. by Monday
from combining features. GFS runs remain flattest/less deep with
the northern stream part of the trough while CMC runs are deeper
and slower than consensus and almost every individual ensemble
member (though the newer 12Z run perhaps in better alignment than
the 00Z through Monday, but beyond Monday the 12Z CMC closes off
an upper low over the Northeast unlike other guidance). Preferred
a middle ground solution like the 00Z ECMWF along with the UKMET
for the depth/extent of the eastern trough on Monday, and the
ECMWF and GEFS and EC ensemble means Tuesday and Wednesday.

This blend of model guidance (00Z/06Z deterministic model
composite led by the EC early on, phasing in the GEFS/EC means and
phasing out the CMC by day 5) also worked well for ridging
building west of the eastern trough, as well as troughing upstream
of the ridging. An upper low offshore of British Columbia could
send several shortwaves through the West with overall low
amplitude troughing coming in, but with differences in the low
predictability details. The 00Z CMC once again appeared too
amplified compared to consensus.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The combination of initial southern Plains ridging plus the upper
ridge crossing the West and reaching the Plains, along with
eventually rising heights over the South will likely promote an
expanding area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The primary focus of this heat during the weekend will be
over the southern Plains (persisting from the short range time
frame) and over the southern half or so of the West with highs
10-15F or so above normal. By Monday-Wednesday the gradual
progression of the upper pattern should lead to slow
intensification of the heat over the southern Plains as highs
could reach up to 15-20F above normal, while plus 10-15F anomalies
spread eastward across the South. The upper trough nearing the
West Coast may offer slight cooling over California after Sunday
and eventually trim the coverage of plus 10F anomalies farther
inland. Potential for daily record highs will be most persistent
through the period over parts of the southern Plains. Record highs
are most likely over southern parts of the West Sunday into early
next week and should steadily spread east into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast during the first half of next
week.

On the other hand, surface waves/fronts ahead of the approaching
eastern Pacific upper trough will tend to keep the Pacific
Northwest on the cool side with precipitation of varying
intensity. Snow levels should be quite high into early next week
and then may decline somewhat as the upper trough begins to move
inland. Individual supporting shortwaves have low predictability
so it will take additional time to resolve details of when/where
precipitation could be locally heavier.

Moisture ahead of a couple fronts could bring lingering moderate
to heavy showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi Valley
region early in the weekend, with a consolidated front becoming
more progressive as upper troughing heads toward and into the
East. Some rainfall along the front could still be fairly intense
but the greater progression may temper maximum totals over the
East. Another trailing front could also support some
showers/thunderstorms, while the trailing part of each front
should stall over the Plains and could focus additional
convection. Currently there are at least vague signals for locally
enhanced rainfall potential within a broad area between the
eastern Plains and Ohio Valley/central Appalachians south to the
Lower Mississippi Valley. However disagreements in
shortwave/surface front details make it difficult to resolve any
defined areas of relatively greater potential. At this point
signals point to enhancement across parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South on Saturday, which could cause localized flooding
especially over areas of training convection and/or wet soils.
Near the East Coast, record heat should continue into Saturday
over New England. The rapidly opening upper low lifting through
the East will produce some areas of rainfall farther south over
the Mid-Atlantic and vicinity.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
256 PM EDT Wed May 11 2022

Valid 12Z Sat May 14 2022 - 12Z Wed May 18 2022

...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while persistent southern Plains heat
intensifies and expands eastward...
...Record warmth to continue over parts of New England into
Saturday...


...Overview...

A rapidly opening upper low over the East on Saturday (spreading
some rain across the region) will provide the last vestige of the
current blocky pattern over and near the lower 48. Guidance is
consistent in showing the upstream flow settling into a
trough-ridge-trough configuration soon thereafter, with the
eastern Pacific trough axis likely pushing into the West around
the middle of next week as the eastern trough nears the East
Coast. The combination of upper ridging that crosses the West,
persistence of a mean ridge over the southern Plains, and with
time rising heights over the Southeast, should lead to an
expanding area of unseasonably hot weather across the southern
U.S. This heat will challenge daily record highs for multiple days
at some locations. New England may see record heat extend into
Saturday as well. A series of fronts pushed along by the
developing central-eastern U.S. cyclonic flow and extending back
into the Plains will produce episodes of showers and thunderstorms
through the period. At the same time the mean trough eventually
reaching the West Coast should send multiple waves/fronts into
western North America, supporting periods of rain and perhaps very
high elevation snow over the Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains consistent with the overall pattern during
the medium range period, which begins Saturday with a closed upper
low in south-central Canada and the opening low/trough centered to
its southeast, while ridging builds into the interior West and
southern Plains. These features all show good agreement in the
00Z/06Z and newer 12Z models. Somewhat more notable differences
arise as troughing develops across the east-central U.S. by Monday
from combining features. GFS runs remain flattest/less deep with
the northern stream part of the trough while CMC runs are deeper
and slower than consensus and almost every individual ensemble
member (though the newer 12Z run perhaps in better alignment than
the 00Z through Monday, but beyond Monday the 12Z CMC closes off
an upper low over the Northeast unlike other guidance). Preferred
a middle ground solution like the 00Z ECMWF along with the UKMET
for the depth/extent of the eastern trough on Monday, and the
ECMWF and GEFS and EC ensemble means Tuesday and Wednesday.

This blend of model guidance (00Z/06Z deterministic model
composite led by the EC early on, phasing in the GEFS/EC means and
phasing out the CMC by day 5) also worked well for ridging
building west of the eastern trough, as well as troughing upstream
of the ridging. An upper low offshore of British Columbia could
send several shortwaves through the West with overall low
amplitude troughing coming in, but with differences in the low
predictability details. The 00Z CMC once again appeared too
amplified compared to consensus.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The combination of initial southern Plains ridging plus the upper
ridge crossing the West and reaching the Plains, along with
eventually rising heights over the South will likely promote an
expanding area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The primary focus of this heat during the weekend will be
over the southern Plains (persisting from the short range time
frame) and over the southern half or so of the West with highs
10-15F or so above normal. By Monday-Wednesday the gradual
progression of the upper pattern should lead to slow
intensification of the heat over the southern Plains as highs
could reach up to 15-20F above normal, while plus 10-15F anomalies
spread eastward across the South. The upper trough nearing the
West Coast may offer slight cooling over California after Sunday
and eventually trim the coverage of plus 10F anomalies farther
inland. Potential for daily record highs will be most persistent
through the period over parts of the southern Plains. Record highs
are most likely over southern parts of the West Sunday into early
next week and should steadily spread east into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast during the first half of next
week.

On the other hand, surface waves/fronts ahead of the approaching
eastern Pacific upper trough will tend to keep the Pacific
Northwest on the cool side with precipitation of varying
intensity. Snow levels should be quite high into early next week
and then may decline somewhat as the upper trough begins to move
inland. Individual supporting shortwaves have low predictability
so it will take additional time to resolve details of when/where
precipitation could be locally heavier.

Moisture ahead of a couple fronts could bring lingering moderate
to heavy showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi Valley
region early in the weekend, with a consolidated front becoming
more progressive as upper troughing heads toward and into the
East. Some rainfall along the front could still be fairly intense
but the greater progression may temper maximum totals over the
East. Another trailing front could also support some
showers/thunderstorms, while the trailing part of each front
should stall over the Plains and could focus additional
convection. Currently there are at least vague signals for locally
enhanced rainfall potential within a broad area between the
eastern Plains and Ohio Valley/central Appalachians south to the
Lower Mississippi Valley. However disagreements in
shortwave/surface front details make it difficult to resolve any
defined areas of relatively greater potential. At this point
signals point to enhancement across parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South on Saturday, which could cause localized flooding
especially over areas of training convection and/or wet soils.
Near the East Coast, record heat should continue into Saturday
over New England. The rapidly opening upper low lifting through
the East will produce some areas of rainfall farther south over
the Mid-Atlantic and vicinity.

FOR THURSDAY MAY 19 - WEDNESDAY MAY 25: The 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles'
500-hPa week-2 mean height forecasts are in good agreement over North Ameri=
ca,
featuring amplified troughing throughout the western and central CONUS, and
downstream ridging east of the Mississippi River. As advertised by yesterda=
y's
ECMWF ensemble, much of this troughing that is favored to develop early in =
the
period has become more amplified in the latest guidance, with a deep trough
axis extending southward into the Desert Southwest by next weekend. Despite
some differences between the GEFS and ECMWF in regards to the timing of thi=
s
mid-level feature, there are increased chances for a much colder and wetter
pattern emerging across the West while remediating some of the elevated
excessive heat risks that have been highlighted throughout the southern CON=
US
in previous hazard outlooks this week.



With positive mid-level height departures favored to linger across the
southern
tier by the outset of week-2, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue =
to
indicate a broad area with at least a 20% chance of maximum temperature
exceeding the 85th percentile in the region. The ECMWF reforecast tool
maintains more coverage of this warm signal across the Southwest than the G=
EFS
early in the period, likely due to a later onset of the aforementioned
mid-level troughing aloft. Therefore, a slight risk of excessive heat is
continued across the south-central and southeastern CONUS for May 19-23 whe=
re
there is the greatest amount of agreement between the tools. In the Souther=
n
Plains, both reforecast tools maintain at least a 40% chance for maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, with higher probabilities (>60%=
)
focused across central Texas supporting the continuation of a moderate risk
and
high risk of excessive heat for May 19-20 and May 19, respectively. This
elevated potential for excessive heat continues to be further supported by
uncalibrated temperature guidance, as well as the National Blend of Models
analysis depicting several locations approaching near record breaking
temperatures (>100 degrees F in parts of Texas) early in the period.



The amplifying mid-level trough, and prevailing northwesterly flow favored =
in
both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles is expected to bring unseasonably cold
temperatures throughout much of the northwestern and north-central CONUS.
Relative to yesterday, a stronger cold trend is reflected in the GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools, with both indicating a larger and more persistent coverag=
e
of
at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile
and below freezing. Thus, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures i=
s
expanded to include nearly the northwestern quarter of the CONUS, and is
extended through the middle of the period (May 19-22). Higher probabilities
(>40%) for reaching hazards criteria are indicated mainly throughout the
Northern Intermountain and Northern Rockies to support the addition of a
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for May 19-20. While the
coldest temperatures (<28 degrees F) are favored for the highest elevations=
,
any frost and/or freezes in the lower elevations may lead to adverse impact=
s
as
sub-freezing temperatures would be considered fairly late for this time of =
the
year in the region.



Enhanced onshore flow and Pacific moisture is anticipated to bring increase=
d
amounts of precipitation to the lee side of the amplifying trough aloft. Th=
e
ECMWF reforecast tool shows a broad region over the higher elevations of th=
e
West with at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding th=
e
85th percentile and a half inch. Given the combination of anomalously cold
temperatures and above-normal precipitation favored during week-2, a slight
risk of heavy snow is posted over the higher elevations of the Northern and
Central Rockies for May 19-21. This is also supported by the GEFS snow wate=
r
equivalent reforecast tool as well as some of the latest deterministic GFS
solutions depicting locally heavy snowfall accumulations in the region late
next week.



At the base of the amplified trough early in the period, a slight risk of h=
igh
winds remains posted for May 19-23 and is expanded to include much of the
western and central CONUS relative to yesterday's outlook. This adjustment =
is
supported by both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools which show a larger
coverage of increased probabilities (>20%) for wind speeds exceeding the 85=
th
percentile and 20mph. In addition, both the latest GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
now
favor a sub 1000-hPa mean low forming over eastern Colorado late next week
which would induce strong pressure gradients early in the period. Given thi=
s
trend, a moderate risk of high winds is issued for parts of the Great Basin=
,
Rockies and High Plains for May 19-21. The continued potential for high win=
ds
is likely to sustain an elevated wildfire risk during the outlook period
across
many parts of the Four Corner region where multiple large wildfires are
currently ongoing. The largest wildfire incident is the Calf Canyon fire
located east of Santa Fe, which has burned over 236,000 acres (as of May 11=
)
with less than half containment.



With lee side cyclogenesis favored during the first several days of the
period,
there is also better ensemble support for the advection of Gulf of Mexico
moisture conducive for potentially heavy precipitation across the central
CONUS
tied to this surface low. The uncalibrated and calibrated ECMWF reforecast
guidances favors a predominately wetter solution early in the period compar=
ed
to the GEFS, however both reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance o=
f
3-day accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch across much of
the
Southern Plains, and the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during day=
s
10-12 (May 21-23). To address some of the differences in timing and locatio=
n
with the heavy precipitation potential, a broad slight risk area of heavy
precipitation is posted over east-central CONUS for May 19-23. Given the
increased potential for heavy precipitation over the Southern Plains, this
reduces the risk for rapid onset drought in eastern Texas during the period=
,
thus the corresponding hazard area is removed in the outlook.



Across the tropics, there continues to be good model support for a
convectively
coupled Kelvin wave aloft traversing the western Hemisphere during week-2,
which is conducive for possible early season tropical cyclone formation.
Several runs of GEFS ensemble members continue to show a handful of deepeni=
ng
low pressure centers tracking northward in the Caribbean, resulting in
enhanced
precipitation signals in the ensemble mean daily totals, as well as in the
GEFS
reforecast tool throughout the Caribbean and Florida during mid to late
week-2.
While this is suggestive of the first signs of tropical cyclone development=
 in
the Atlantic for the season, no corresponding precipitation related hazards
are
posted given general uncertainty at this lead, and that these solutions rem=
ain
isolated to one model. However, any potential tropical developments and
consensus among the models and probabilistic tropical cyclone tools will be
addressed in subsequent week-2 U.S. hazards outlooks.



Flooding is likely to persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of =
the
North, and extending into part of the James River basin due to ongoing
snowmelt
and above-normal precipitation favored during week-1. Across Alaska,
below-normal temperatures are predominately favored throughout much of the
Mainland. Although anomalously cold temperatures may slow the rate of
springtime snowmelt and ice-river breakup, a possible flood hazard is
maintained for much of the central and eastern Mainland.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed May 11 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 17 - 21 2022

All models show a de-amplifying mid-level 500-hPa anomaly pattern over the
course of the 6 to 10 day period, particularly at higher latitudes, but the=
re
are some notable differences relative to forecasts from the past several da=
ys.
Today, the GEFS and European ensemble means are both more amplified than
yesterday, dropping a mid-level trough into the Pacific Northwest and Mount=
ain
West by the end of the period, with the largest 500-hPa height anomalies
centered over the northern Rockies. The Canadian ensemble mean remains less
amplified - more like yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecasts - but=
 does show mid-level
heights
slightly lower in the Mountain West than elsewhere. Based on both model
consensus and teleconnections on the strong mid-level ridge southwest of
Mainland Alaska, below-normal heights are somewhat favored in the Mountain
West
- more amplified than the Canadian ensemble mean, but less meridional than =
the
GEFS and European ensemble means (effectively a compromise between the
GEFS/European mean solutions, the more-zonal Canadian ensemble mean, and
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook). Elsewhere, models generally=
 agree that the strong
mid-level ridge southwest of Canada will slowly break down, and a relativel=
y
zonal pattern will develop with positive 500-hPa height anomalies west of t=
he
CONUS and over the Eastern States, and mid-level troughing with negative
500-hPa height anomalies in the northern Rockies and off the northeast CONU=
S
coast. Assuming less meridional extent to the mid-level trough over the
Mountain West, 500-hPa heights should remain at or above normal in the
southern
Rockies.

This forecast pattern results in enhanced chances for above-normal
temperatures
across the southern half of the CONUS and near the northeastern CONUS
coastline. A significant early-season heat wave centered over the south-
central
CONUS should continue through most of the period. Re-forecast tools from bo=
th
the GEFS and the European ensembles show temperatures averaging over 10 deg=
. F
above normal for the period centered over the Red River (of the South) Vall=
ey,
but the heat should ease slightly late in the period in response to the
developing trough in the northern Rockies. In contrast, subnormal temperatu=
res
are favored in the north-central and northwestern CONUS near the developing
mid-level trough and lower 500-hPa heights.

Elevated chances for drier than normal conditions cover much of the
southwestern quarter of the CONUS, near the 500-hPa ridge off the West Coas=
t
and south of the developing trough in the northern Rockies. Subnormal
precipitation is also slightly favored in parts of the mid-Atlantic and
northeastern CONUS in response to increasing 500-hPa heights. Meanwhile,
increased chances for above normal precipitation are indicated from the
Pacific
Northwest into the Great Lakes, near or downstream from the mean mid-level
trough.

The strong ridge southwest of Alaska is forecast by all models to deteriora=
te
slowly, creating slightly enhanced odds for above normal temperatures and
below
normal precipitation over much of the southwestern part of the Mainland, wi=
th
enhanced chances for cooler, wetter conditions farther north and east


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z European Ensem=
ble
Mean centered on Day 7, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is below
average, 2 out of 5, because of uncertainties in the evolution of the chang=
ing
pattern, and model differences in both the Rockies and eastern CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 19 - 25 2022

There is general model agreement that a relatively zonal pattern should
dominate the country, with mid-level ridging over and west of the Pacific
Coast
States and (to a lesser extent) over the eastern CONUS. The GEFS and Europe=
an
ensembles continue to favor a trough over the Mountain West with the larges=
t
500-hPa height anomalies centered over the northern Rockies, while the
Canadian
ensembles show mostly near-normal heights here. Again, troughing in the
Mountain West is favored based on the preponderance of the model solutions =
and
teleconnections associated with the deteriorating ridge southwest of Mainla=
nd
Alaska, but with less amplitude than the GEFS and European ensemble means n=
ow
indicate. Somewhat above-normal 500-hPa heights in the south-central and
eastern CONUS should persist through the period, and may increase slightly =
in
the southern Great Plains toward the end of week-2, possibly signaling the
re-emergence of unseasonably hot weather in that region.

The slightly more-amplified solution favored today than yesterday should br=
ing
a fetch of warm, moist air northward from the Gulf of Mexico into the centr=
al
CONUS, between the mid-level trough in the Rockies and the above-normal 500=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN AND
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS....

...Southern/central High Plains...
Minor changes have been made along the eastern end of the Critical
area based on the latest guidance. Overnight
thunderstorms/precipitation and the position of the dryline/lee
trough suggests some uncertainty on the eastern bound of the
critical conditions, especially across far eastern Colorado. A few
lightning strikes may also interact with dry fuel beds across the
region, though storm coverage and mode are not expected to support
IsoDryT probabilities at this time.

Localized extremely critical conditions may also develop around mid
day across portions of the Foothills in the immediate lee of the
Front Range. The strong west/southwesterly flow interacting with
terrain gaps may support occasional gusts to 40+ mph concurrent with
the single digit humidity values across the High Plains. However,
confidence in widespread extremely critical conditions is lower
owing to recent reductions in sustained wind speeds by the latest
guidance. See the previous forecast for more information.

..Lyons.. 05/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Wed May 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low will eject into the
northern Plains tomorrow/Thursday, with dry westerly surface flow
occurring in their wake across portions of the southern and central
High Plains. Strong mid-level flow aligned roughly perpendicular to
the Rockies, along with robust boundary-layer mixing and surface
gradient winds, will all serve to promote very strong downslope flow
along the lee of the central and southern Rockies tomorrow
afternoon. Latest guidance consensus depicts 25+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds overlapping 10-15 percent RH from the
Colorado/Nebraska border into northeast New Mexico. With anomalously
dry fuels in place (widespread ERCs exceeding the 95th percentile),
high-end Critical conditions are expected, with at least locally
Extremely Critical conditions likely in terrain-favoring areas, and
where stronger wind gusts can develop. If guidance consensus depicts
any increase in wind speeds or further decrease in RH, Extremely
Critical highlights may be introduced in future outlooks.

...Threat of severe thunderstorms and flash flooding continues
across the Upper Midwest and Northern Plains through Thursday
night...

area from the Southern Plains to the Great Lakes and northern New
England...

Rockies, and central/southern High Plains into Thursday...

...Unsettled weather to enter the Northwest and Southeast on
Thursday and Friday...

An active and anomalous weather pattern will continue to impact
the Nation over the next few days, with several potential hazards
spanning from severe weather to potentially dangerous heat.
Starting in the north-central U.S., a surface boundary currently
lifting north as a warm front this afternoon and is likely to
spawn numerous thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and tornadoes from eastern South Dakota and
northwest Iowa toward southern/central Minnesota and northwest
Wisconsin. These thunderstorms will also have the potential to
contain heavy rainfall rates and lead to instances of flash
flooding. An area of low pressure is forecast to develop along
this quasi-stationary boundary on Thursday over the central High
Plains and ahead of an approaching upper-level trough ejecting out
of the Intermountain West. While rapidly strengthening, the area
of low pressure is forecast to move northward into the Northern
Plains and spread areas of showers and thunderstorms. Once again,
the potential for severe thunderstorms will exist from the
northern/central Plains towards the Upper Midwest as a strong cold
front swings eastward. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an
Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe weather on Thursday across
parts of Minnesota, southeast North Dakota, eastern South Dakota,
northwest Iowa, and eastern Nebraska. Additionally, heavy rain
over already saturated soils is possible across eastern Montana,
North Dakota, and northern Minnesota on Thursday. As a result,
instances of flash flooding are possible which has prompted a
Slight Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall to be issued for
this region. By Friday, the main low pressure center is expected
to enter south-central Canada as the attached cold front pushes
into the Midwest and southern Plains. The severe weather threat on
Friday is forecast to diminish slightly and extend along the cold
front.

Ahead of the approaching western U.S. upper-level trough, an
anomalous ridge set up over the Great Lakes and northern New
England will lead to widespread above average temperatures. Highs
20+ degrees above average are forecast on Thursday and Friday
across the Great Lakes, Interior Northeast, and northern New
England, which equates to temperatures into the 80s. Highs into
the 90s will reach as far north as Iowa on Thursday, which
combined with heat indices approaching 100 degrees, has prompted
Heat Advisories to be issued across parts of the Midwest.
Meanwhile, much of the southern Plains will continue to experience
summer-like warmth and highs into the mid-to-upper 90s. Dozens of
daily high temperature records will potentially fall on Thursday
throughout 16 states spanning from Texas to Maine. The anomalous
early-season heat is anticipated to relax slightly on Friday
(outside of northern New England) as the cold front and associated
thunderstorm activity enters further into the Midwest and
central/southern Plains.

As the previously mentioned storm system strengthens over the
central High Plains, gusty winds and low relative humidity will
make for dangerous fire weather conditions over the Southwest. The
Critical Fire Weather risk also extends into the southern Rockies
this evening and central/southern High Plains on Thursday. Red
Flag Warnings and High Wind Warnings have also been issued.

Elsewhere, a retrograding low pressure system and associated
moisture from the western Atlantic is forecast to begin entering
the Southeast by late Thursday. Areas of showers and isolated
thunderstorms will lead to unsettled weather along the East Coast
from southern New England to northeast Florida. Rain is also
expected to enter the Northwest as a frontal system swings into
the region on Thursday, with locally heavy rainfall possible along
coastal regions of Washington and Oregon. Snow is likely in the
higher elevations of the Cascades before spreading into the
northern Rockies Friday morning.

...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while persistent southern Plains heat
intensifies and expands eastward...
...Record warmth to continue over parts of New England into
Saturday...


...Overview...

A rapidly opening upper low over the East on Saturday (spreading
some rain across the region) will provide the last vestige of the
current blocky pattern over and near the lower 48. Guidance is
consistent in showing the upstream flow settling into a
trough-ridge-trough configuration soon thereafter, with the
eastern Pacific trough axis likely pushing into the West around
the middle of next week as the eastern trough nears the East
Coast. The combination of upper ridging that crosses the West,
persistence of a mean ridge over the southern Plains, and with
time rising heights over the Southeast, should lead to an
expanding area of unseasonably hot weather across the southern
U.S. This heat will challenge daily record highs for multiple days
at some locations. New England may see record heat extend into
Saturday as well. A series of fronts pushed along by the
developing central-eastern U.S. cyclonic flow and extending back
into the Plains will produce episodes of showers and thunderstorms
through the period. At the same time the mean trough eventually
reaching the West Coast should send multiple waves/fronts into
western North America, supporting periods of rain and perhaps very
high elevation snow over the Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains consistent with the overall pattern during
the medium range period, which begins Saturday with a closed upper
low in south-central Canada and the opening low/trough centered to
its southeast, while ridging builds into the interior West and
southern Plains. These features all show good agreement in the
00Z/06Z and newer 12Z models. Somewhat more notable differences
arise as troughing develops across the east-central U.S. by Monday
from combining features. GFS runs remain flattest/less deep with
the northern stream part of the trough while CMC runs are deeper
and slower than consensus and almost every individual ensemble
member (though the newer 12Z run perhaps in better alignment than
the 00Z through Monday, but beyond Monday the 12Z CMC closes off
an upper low over the Northeast unlike other guidance). Preferred
a middle ground solution like the 00Z ECMWF along with the UKMET
for the depth/extent of the eastern trough on Monday, and the
ECMWF and GEFS and EC ensemble means Tuesday and Wednesday.

This blend of model guidance (00Z/06Z deterministic model
composite led by the EC early on, phasing in the GEFS/EC means and
phasing out the CMC by day 5) also worked well for ridging
building west of the eastern trough, as well as troughing upstream
of the ridging. An upper low offshore of British Columbia could
send several shortwaves through the West with overall low
amplitude troughing coming in, but with differences in the low
predictability details. The 00Z CMC once again appeared too
amplified compared to consensus.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The combination of initial southern Plains ridging plus the upper
ridge crossing the West and reaching the Plains, along with
eventually rising heights over the South will likely promote an
expanding area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The primary focus of this heat during the weekend will be
over the southern Plains (persisting from the short range time
frame) and over the southern half or so of the West with highs
10-15F or so above normal. By Monday-Wednesday the gradual
progression of the upper pattern should lead to slow
intensification of the heat over the southern Plains as highs
could reach up to 15-20F above normal, while plus 10-15F anomalies
spread eastward across the South. The upper trough nearing the
West Coast may offer slight cooling over California after Sunday
and eventually trim the coverage of plus 10F anomalies farther
inland. Potential for daily record highs will be most persistent
through the period over parts of the southern Plains. Record highs
are most likely over southern parts of the West Sunday into early
next week and should steadily spread east into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast during the first half of next
week.

On the other hand, surface waves/fronts ahead of the approaching
eastern Pacific upper trough will tend to keep the Pacific
Northwest on the cool side with precipitation of varying
intensity. Snow levels should be quite high into early next week
and then may decline somewhat as the upper trough begins to move
inland. Individual supporting shortwaves have low predictability
so it will take additional time to resolve details of when/where
precipitation could be locally heavier.

Moisture ahead of a couple fronts could bring lingering moderate
to heavy showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi Valley
region early in the weekend, with a consolidated front becoming
more progressive as upper troughing heads toward and into the
East. Some rainfall along the front could still be fairly intense
but the greater progression may temper maximum totals over the
East. Another trailing front could also support some
showers/thunderstorms, while the trailing part of each front
should stall over the Plains and could focus additional
convection. Currently there are at least vague signals for locally
enhanced rainfall potential within a broad area between the
eastern Plains and Ohio Valley/central Appalachians south to the
Lower Mississippi Valley. However disagreements in
shortwave/surface front details make it difficult to resolve any
defined areas of relatively greater potential. At this point
signals point to enhancement across parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South on Saturday, which could cause localized flooding
especially over areas of training convection and/or wet soils.
Near the East Coast, record heat should continue into Saturday
over New England. The rapidly opening upper low lifting through
the East will produce some areas of rainfall farther south over
the Mid-Atlantic and vicinity.

...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while persistent southern Plains heat
intensifies and expands eastward...
...Record warmth to continue over parts of New England into
Saturday...


...Overview...

A rapidly opening upper low over the East on Saturday (spreading
some rain across the region) will provide the last vestige of the
current blocky pattern over and near the lower 48. Guidance is
consistent in showing the upstream flow settling into a
trough-ridge-trough configuration soon thereafter, with the
eastern Pacific trough axis likely pushing into the West around
the middle of next week as the eastern trough nears the East
Coast. The combination of upper ridging that crosses the West,
persistence of a mean ridge over the southern Plains, and with
time rising heights over the Southeast, should lead to an
expanding area of unseasonably hot weather across the southern
U.S. This heat will challenge daily record highs for multiple days
at some locations. New England may see record heat extend into
Saturday as well. A series of fronts pushed along by the
developing central-eastern U.S. cyclonic flow and extending back
into the Plains will produce episodes of showers and thunderstorms
through the period. At the same time the mean trough eventually
reaching the West Coast should send multiple waves/fronts into
western North America, supporting periods of rain and perhaps very
high elevation snow over the Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains consistent with the overall pattern during
the medium range period, which begins Saturday with a closed upper
low in south-central Canada and the opening low/trough centered to
its southeast, while ridging builds into the interior West and
southern Plains. These features all show good agreement in the
00Z/06Z and newer 12Z models. Somewhat more notable differences
arise as troughing develops across the east-central U.S. by Monday
from combining features. GFS runs remain flattest/less deep with
the northern stream part of the trough while CMC runs are deeper
and slower than consensus and almost every individual ensemble
member (though the newer 12Z run perhaps in better alignment than
the 00Z through Monday, but beyond Monday the 12Z CMC closes off
an upper low over the Northeast unlike other guidance). Preferred
a middle ground solution like the 00Z ECMWF along with the UKMET
for the depth/extent of the eastern trough on Monday, and the
ECMWF and GEFS and EC ensemble means Tuesday and Wednesday.

This blend of model guidance (00Z/06Z deterministic model
composite led by the EC early on, phasing in the GEFS/EC means and
phasing out the CMC by day 5) also worked well for ridging
building west of the eastern trough, as well as troughing upstream
of the ridging. An upper low offshore of British Columbia could
send several shortwaves through the West with overall low
amplitude troughing coming in, but with differences in the low
predictability details. The 00Z CMC once again appeared too
amplified compared to consensus.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The combination of initial southern Plains ridging plus the upper
ridge crossing the West and reaching the Plains, along with
eventually rising heights over the South will likely promote an
expanding area of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the
period. The primary focus of this heat during the weekend will be
over the southern Plains (persisting from the short range time
frame) and over the southern half or so of the West with highs
10-15F or so above normal. By Monday-Wednesday the gradual
progression of the upper pattern should lead to slow
intensification of the heat over the southern Plains as highs
could reach up to 15-20F above normal, while plus 10-15F anomalies
spread eastward across the South. The upper trough nearing the
West Coast may offer slight cooling over California after Sunday
and eventually trim the coverage of plus 10F anomalies farther
inland. Potential for daily record highs will be most persistent
through the period over parts of the southern Plains. Record highs
are most likely over southern parts of the West Sunday into early
next week and should steadily spread east into the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Southeast during the first half of next
week.

On the other hand, surface waves/fronts ahead of the approaching
eastern Pacific upper trough will tend to keep the Pacific
Northwest on the cool side with precipitation of varying
intensity. Snow levels should be quite high into early next week
and then may decline somewhat as the upper trough begins to move
inland. Individual supporting shortwaves have low predictability
so it will take additional time to resolve details of when/where
precipitation could be locally heavier.

Moisture ahead of a couple fronts could bring lingering moderate
to heavy showers and thunderstorms to the Mississippi Valley
region early in the weekend, with a consolidated front becoming
more progressive as upper troughing heads toward and into the
East. Some rainfall along the front could still be fairly intense
but the greater progression may temper maximum totals over the
East. Another trailing front could also support some
showers/thunderstorms, while the trailing part of each front
should stall over the Plains and could focus additional
convection. Currently there are at least vague signals for locally
enhanced rainfall potential within a broad area between the
eastern Plains and Ohio Valley/central Appalachians south to the
Lower Mississippi Valley. However disagreements in
shortwave/surface front details make it difficult to resolve any
defined areas of relatively greater potential. At this point
signals point to enhancement across parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South on Saturday, which could cause localized flooding
especially over areas of training convection and/or wet soils.
Near the East Coast, record heat should continue into Saturday
over New England. The rapidly opening upper low lifting through
the East will produce some areas of rainfall farther south over
the Mid-Atlantic and vicinity.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN INTO
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will traverse the central Rockies today,
encouraging the deepening of a surface cyclone across the northern
Plains states. As such, deep-layer westerly flow over the Rockies
will encourage strong downslope flow from the Colorado Front Range
southward into eastern New Mexico during the afternoon. 25 mph
sustained westerly surface winds coinciding with 5-15 percent RH by
afternoon peak heating will encourage high-end Critical fire weather
conditions along the immediate lee of the central Rockies given the
anomalously dry fuels in the area. Locally Extremely Critical
conditions may also appear in terrain-favoring areas where the
ambient winds can be channeled, as well as any location experiencing
persistent higher gusts through the afternoon.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As an upper trough ejects into Canada at the start of the day
tomorrow/Friday, zonal flow aloft will prevail across the western
and central CONUS. High pressure and weaker ambient surface winds
will prevail across much of the Southwest into the southern High
Plains, serving as a reprieve from the many preceding days of
Critical wildfire-spread conditions. Nonetheless, anomalously dry
fuels will still remain across much of the Southwest into the High
Plains due to an ongoing exceptional drought. Any terrain-favoring
locations that can generate gusty conditions amid very low RH would
support localized wildfire spread.

...Heat threat for California and the Southwest from the weekend
into next week while persistent southern Plains heat intensifies
and expands eastward...


...Overview...

The latest models and ensemble means continue to suggest that a
trough-ridge-trough pattern aloft will make gradual eastward
progress with time, such that the mean troughs should reach near
the East and West Coasts around Wednesday. Troughing may begin to
amplify somewhat over the West thereafter while the downstream
ridge broadens as it crosses the Plains/Mississippi Valley.
Initial western U.S. and southern Plains ridging followed by
rising heights over the Southeast will lead to a broad area of
unseasonably hot weather across the southern U.S. This heat will
be most persistent over the southern Plains and vicinity while it
should peak over western areas during Sunday-Tuesday and extend
farther east from the Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley by around
Tuesday-Thursday. High temperatures will likely challenge daily
records for multiple days at some locations. A series
shortwaves/fronts ejecting from the trough eventually arriving
into the West will produce cool conditions with periods of rain
and perhaps high elevation snow over the Northwest. Meanwhile
fronts pushed along by the mean trough crossing the eastern half
of the country and stalling back over the Plains will help to
focus areas of showers and thunderstorms of varying intensity
through the period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

For the most part, the latest guidance agreed fairly well for the
mean pattern but with persistent differences for
low-predictability shortwave details within the eastern U.S.
trough as well as for shortwaves moving through and ejecting from
the Pacific trough eventually pushing into the West. Day-to-day
frontal position and thus specifics of convective focus will be
sensitive to these uncertain medium to smaller scale aspects of
the forecast. From the large scale perspective, the latest CMC
runs have offered the greatest discrepancies versus remaining
guidance as they are more amplified with the eastern trough and
stray to the progressive extreme with western-central U.S. energy
Tuesday-Thursday. The new 00Z run is not as extreme as its prior
run in the East but still questionable. Meanwhile the 18Z GFS was
a bit on the flatter side with the eastern trough, while in the
latter half of the period the 18Z GFS was deeper with energy
coming into the Northwest around Tuesday but the 12Z run ultimate
strayed to the deep side with trailing amplification by next
Thursday. Not surprising given some of the operational model
differences that develop with the eastern Pacific/western U.S.
trough, GEFS/ECens/CMCens member spread becomes noticeably more
pronounced by Wednesday-Thursday. Guidance comparisons ultimately
led to emphasizing the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET and 12Z/18Z GFS for the
updated forecast during the first half of the period and then
rapidly increased 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input (reaching a total
of 60 percent by day 7 Thursday) to emphasize the more agreeable
large scale pattern while downplaying the uncertain details.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial southern Plains/western ridging and then eventually rising
heights farther east over the South will likely promote broad area
of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the period. The
greatest anomalies through the period should be over the southern
Plains (persisting from the short range time frame) where some
locations could see highs up to 15-20F above normal. The southern
half or so of the West will tend to see highs up to 10-15F above
normal from Sunday into at least the first part of next week
followed by a cooling trend that reaches California initially and
extends farther eastward by next Thursday as Pacific upper
troughing arrives. Meanwhile by Tuesday or Wednesday through
Thursday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal should extend
eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Southeast. Potential for daily record highs will be most
persistent through the period over parts of the southern Plains.
Numerous record highs will be possible each day over areas with
plus 10F and greater high temperature anomalies.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to
decline as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the
short range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. From Sunday into Monday the best focus
for showers and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing
through the East. There may be one area of emphasis over and near
the south-central Mississippi Valley on Sunday while additional
areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may occur from the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into New England. Frontal progression may
temper amounts over these latter areas even if some of the
rainfall is fairly intense while much of New England has dry soil
conditions to mitigate effects of any locally heavy rainfall. Then
from later Monday through Thursday, the stalling of the leading
front and another one behind it over the Plains along with
shortwaves aloft will provide focus for multiple areas of showers
and thunderstorms/convective complexes from the northern-central
Plains into the central Appalachians or vicinity. Some rainfall
may be heavy, with some added time required to refine the details
of coverage and timing of highest totals.

...Heat threat for California and the Southwest from the weekend
into next week while persistent southern Plains heat intensifies
and expands eastward...


...Overview...

The latest models and ensemble means continue to suggest that a
trough-ridge-trough pattern aloft will make gradual eastward
progress with time, such that the mean troughs should reach near
the East and West Coasts around Wednesday. Troughing may begin to
amplify somewhat over the West thereafter while the downstream
ridge broadens as it crosses the Plains/Mississippi Valley.
Initial western U.S. and southern Plains ridging followed by
rising heights over the Southeast will lead to a broad area of
unseasonably hot weather across the southern U.S. This heat will
be most persistent over the southern Plains and vicinity while it
should peak over western areas during Sunday-Tuesday and extend
farther east from the Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley by around
Tuesday-Thursday. High temperatures will likely challenge daily
records for multiple days at some locations. A series
shortwaves/fronts ejecting from the trough eventually arriving
into the West will produce cool conditions with periods of rain
and perhaps high elevation snow over the Northwest. Meanwhile
fronts pushed along by the mean trough crossing the eastern half
of the country and stalling back over the Plains will help to
focus areas of showers and thunderstorms of varying intensity
through the period.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

For the most part, the latest guidance agreed fairly well for the
mean pattern but with persistent differences for
low-predictability shortwave details within the eastern U.S.
trough as well as for shortwaves moving through and ejecting from
the Pacific trough eventually pushing into the West. Day-to-day
frontal position and thus specifics of convective focus will be
sensitive to these uncertain medium to smaller scale aspects of
the forecast. From the large scale perspective, the latest CMC
runs have offered the greatest discrepancies versus remaining
guidance as they are more amplified with the eastern trough and
stray to the progressive extreme with western-central U.S. energy
Tuesday-Thursday. The new 00Z run is not as extreme as its prior
run in the East but still questionable. Meanwhile the 18Z GFS was
a bit on the flatter side with the eastern trough, while in the
latter half of the period the 18Z GFS was deeper with energy
coming into the Northwest around Tuesday but the 12Z run ultimate
strayed to the deep side with trailing amplification by next
Thursday. Not surprising given some of the operational model
differences that develop with the eastern Pacific/western U.S.
trough, GEFS/ECens/CMCens member spread becomes noticeably more
pronounced by Wednesday-Thursday. Guidance comparisons ultimately
led to emphasizing the 12Z ECMWF/UKMET and 12Z/18Z GFS for the
updated forecast during the first half of the period and then
rapidly increased 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF mean input (reaching a total
of 60 percent by day 7 Thursday) to emphasize the more agreeable
large scale pattern while downplaying the uncertain details.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Initial southern Plains/western ridging and then eventually rising
heights farther east over the South will likely promote broad area
of heat across much of the southern U.S. during the period. The
greatest anomalies through the period should be over the southern
Plains (persisting from the short range time frame) where some
locations could see highs up to 15-20F above normal. The southern
half or so of the West will tend to see highs up to 10-15F above
normal from Sunday into at least the first part of next week
followed by a cooling trend that reaches California initially and
extends farther eastward by next Thursday as Pacific upper
troughing arrives. Meanwhile by Tuesday or Wednesday through
Thursday the coverage of highs 10-15F above normal should extend
eastward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Southeast. Potential for daily record highs will be most
persistent through the period over parts of the southern Plains.
Numerous record highs will be possible each day over areas with
plus 10F and greater high temperature anomalies.

In contrast, the series of surface waves/fronts ahead of the
approaching/arriving eastern Pacific upper trough will keep the
Pacific Northwest on the cool side with frequent episodes of
precipitation. The trough should reach far enough eastward to
bring highs down to 10-15F below normal over the
Northwest/northern Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday. Snow levels
should be quite high into early next week and then begin to
decline as the upper trough arrives. It will likely take into the
short range time frame to resolve timing/intensity aspects of each
precipitation episode due to the medium to smaller scale of the
supporting shortwaves.

Areas to the east of the Rockies should generally see two rainfall
regimes during the period. From Sunday into Monday the best focus
for showers and thunderstorms will be along a cold front pushing
through the East. There may be one area of emphasis over and near
the south-central Mississippi Valley on Sunday while additional
areas of locally moderate to heavy rainfall may occur from the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley into New England. Frontal progression may
temper amounts over these latter areas even if some of the
rainfall is fairly intense while much of New England has dry soil
conditions to mitigate effects of any locally heavy rainfall. Then
from later Monday through Thursday, the stalling of the leading
front and another one behind it over the Plains along with
shortwaves aloft will provide focus for multiple areas of showers
and thunderstorms/convective complexes from the northern-central
Plains into the central Appalachians or vicinity. Some rainfall
may be heavy, with some added time required to refine the details
of coverage and timing of highest totals.

...Rapidly developing low pressure system will bring rounds of
heavy rain, severe thunderstorms and strong winds across the Upper
Midwest and northern Plains through Thursday night...

...Summer-like heat across a large area from the southern Plains
to the Great Lakes and northern New England will continue to
challenge daily records...

...Unsettled weather to enter the Northwest as well as over the
East Coast during the next couple of days...

...Another day of critical fire danger across central/southern
High Plains today before conditions ease on Friday...

An anomalous weather pattern will continue to bring active weather
across the northern Plains as well as the Pacific Northwest,
anomalous heat from the midsection of the country to the
Northeast, while a low pressure system is forecast to move back
toward the East Coast.  Starting in the midsection of the country,
upper-level energy moving through a persistent upper trough across
the western U.S. will interact with a stalled front to result in a
rapidly developing low pressure system to sweep through the
northern Plains today and into tonight.  Rain is forecast to
expand across the northern High Plains as the system rapidly
intensifies just to the south.  Strong to severe thunderstorms
will also impact the upper Midwest during the early morning hours
ahead of a lifting warm front.  As the low pressure further
intensifies later today, a strong cold front will sweep across the
northern Plains, triggering another round of strong to severe
thunderstorms as a result.  These storms are forecast to reach
into the upper Midwest by tonight with locally heavy rain and
instances of flash flooding possible.  By Friday, the main low
pressure center is expected to enter south-central Canada as the
attached cold front stalls across the upper Midwest and trails
back across southern Plains.  The severe weather threat is
forecast to diminish slightly on Friday but additional rounds of
strong thunderstorms can be expected to reignited near this
frontal boundary into Saturday morning.

Ahead of the western U.S. upper-level trough, an anomalous ridge
anchored over the Great Lakes and northern New England will lead
to widespread above average temperatures.  Highs 20+ degrees above
average are forecast on Thursday and Friday across the Great
Lakes, Interior Northeast, and northern New England, which equates
to temperatures into the 80s.  Highs into the 90s will reach as
far north as Iowa today, which combined with heat indices
approaching 100 degrees, has prompted Heat Advisories to be issued
across parts of the Midwest.  Meanwhile, much of the southern
Plains will continue to experience summer-like warmth and highs
into the mid-to-upper 90s. Dozens of daily high temperature
records will be challenged once again today throughout 16 states
spanning from Texas to Maine.  The anomalous early-season heat is
anticipated to relax slightly on Friday (outside of northern New
England) as the cold front and associated thunderstorm activity
enters further into the Midwest and central/southern Plains.

As the previously mentioned storm system strengthens over the
central High Plains, gusty winds and low relative humidity will
make for another day of dangerous fire weather conditions over the
central/southern High Plains today before conditions ease on
Friday.

Elsewhere, a retrograding low pressure system and associated
moisture from the western Atlantic is forecast to begin entering
the Southeast today.  Areas of showers and isolated thunderstorms
will lead to unsettled weather along the East Coast from southern
New England to northeast Florida.  Rain is also expected to enter
the Northwest as a frontal system swings into the region on today,
with locally heavy rainfall possible along coastal regions of
Washington and Oregon.  Snow is likely in the higher elevations of
the Cascades before spreading into the northern Rockies Friday
morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a deepening trough will pivot eastward through
upper Midwest toward the Great Lakes while weak zonal flow persists
across much of the western US. Weak monsoonal flow over the
Southwest will continue with showers and thunderstorms likely across
southern California and western Arizona. At the surface, a cold
front will stall across the Plains with stronger northwesterly flow
aloft supporting dry and gusty conditions across parts of Texas,
Oklahoma, and Kansas.

...Southern Plains...
At the start of the forecast period a cold front is forecast to move
slowly south through Kansas and into northern Oklahoma before
stalling by early afternoon. Along and south of the front, gusty
south/southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph are expected to
develop by early afternoon. Bolstered by increasing mid-level flow
on the western flank of the upper Midwest trough, the gusty winds
will accompany a dry airmass with widespread surface RH below 20%.
With dry fuels in place, elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions are possible through the afternoon. Weakening winds
overnight should curtail the fire weather threat by early evening.

...Northern Plains...
In the dry post-frontal airmass across the western Dakotas and far
eastern Montana, strong northwesterly flow aloft on the backside of
the trough will bolster breezy northwesterly surface winds of 15-20
mph. Downslope trajectories behind the front will favor low surface
humidity of 15-20% through the afternoon. At least a few hours of
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions appear probable
given dry fuels in place. A rapid cessation of fire danger is
expected in the evening, as winds weaken and temperatures fall into
the 50s/60s F supporting higher humidity recoveries overnight.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 AM CDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Troughing over the Midwest and Great Lakes will move eastward toward
the Northeastern US while shortwave ridging develops over the center
of the country. A second trough will move onshore across the Pacific
Northwest late, bringing increasing mid-level flow and dry
conditions to the Rockies and western US.

...Northern/Central Rockies...
Ahead of the Pacific Northwest trough, westerly mid-level flow will
begin to increase in the wake of shortwave ridging across the
Rockies. In response, a lee trough is expected to form early Day 2
enhancing low-level westerly winds through portions of Montana and
southern Wyoming. The dry westerly flow will support low surface RH
of 15-25% with winds of 15-20 mph. However, the greatest overlap
with dry and windy conditions is forecast to remain within areas of
less receptive and available fuels. This suggests the threat for
elevated fire weather conditions should remain mostly local in
nature.

...Southern Plains...
Widespread elevated fire weather conditions are not expected during
the forecast period on day 2. However, a prolonged dry period will
continue with gusty surface winds near the lee trough, and surface
RH below 20%. With dry fuels in place, a risk for locally elevated
fire weather conditions may linger for a few hours across portions
of The Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
253 AM EDT Fri Sep 24 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 27 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 01 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will begin on Monday with a closed upper
low offshore of British Columbia and another in southeastern
Canada, spreading low amplitude ridging to the Northwest and
Northeast. Besides a compact upper low moving across the Southwest
to Southern Plains, ridging should dominate the center of the
country. This general trough-ridge-trough pattern should maintain
itself and even amplify during the period as the initial
trough/low is forecast to push into the western U.S. and amplify
ridging over the central U.S. during the week, while additional
energy strengthens the trough in the East as well.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

While model guidance generally is agreeable with the overall
trough-ridge-trough pattern described above, differences in
placement of the features as well as their evolution remain. On
day 3/Monday, 12/18Z GFS runs were somewhat out of line with
consensus regarding the structure and placement of the upper low
in southeastern Canada, splitting some energy eastward and
shifting the center of the main upper low to the west because of
the split, though less so than in its previous runs. Favored the
other deterministic guidance for this upper low placement, and
noticed the 00Z GFS came in more in line with other models,
showing one low. As the week progresses, all guidance generally
shows amplification of troughing in the East, including the GFS,
which had been out of phase in previous runs.

In the West, overall good agreement exists for the first part of
the period with troughing coming in and with the small upper low
shifting from the Southwest into the Southern Plains and
eventually getting absorbed into the eastern side of the trough.
However, uncertainty increases from midweek onward given a complex
pattern with multiple shortwaves potentially tracking through the
trough stemming from the lower predictability northern Pacific.
There are questions of northern/southern stream separation or
phasing as another vort max may come into the Southwest later in
the week, with the 12Z EC and CMC separating the streams more
quickly than GFS runs. The GFS runs also produced troughing across
the Northern Rockies/Northern Plains for the latter part of the
workweek, unlike other guidance. Confidence in the evolution of
these features is low.

The WPC forecast began with a blend of 12Z/18Z deterministic
guidance and shifted to include more ensemble mean guidance as the
medium range period progressed to lessen the differences between
individual models.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Increasing moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is forecast to spread
into Texas by Monday/Tuesday, causing increased chances of
rain/storms there and farther north into the Plains later in the
week, focusing ahead of a frontal boundary. Scattered showers in
parts of the Four Corners states could become more widespread and
heavier later in the week as well. The Pacific Northwest should
see periods of orographically enhanced precipitation with the
upper trough, especially Monday, and even high elevation snow for
the Cascades after a cold frontal passage. Generally only light
precipitation is forecast elsewhere in the country, with a
possible round of rain moving south across the Eastern Seaboard
with the front, and scattered showers across southern parts of
Florida.

Temperatures are expected to be warmer than average for the
north-central U.S. throughout the period underneath the
upper-level ridge. The Northern Plains in particular could see
temperatures around 15-25 degrees above normal, with highs in the
mid to upper 80s. Troughing influencing the western U.S. will lead
to below normal temperatures there, with highs 10-20 degrees below
average spreading from the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin.
Meanwhile, temperatures in the East will generally be right around
average.

...Isolated instances of flash flooding possible across parts of
New England, southern Florida, and the Southwest through this
weekend...

...After a brief taste of autumn, well above average temperatures
return to the Northern Plains by Saturday...

A slow moving cold front pushing across the Northeast is expected
to continue producing moderate to locally heavy rain across parts
of New England today, with a few severe thunderstorms not out of
the question as well. As the frontal boundary reaches central
Maine on Saturday, it is expected to stall and lead to lingering
showers. Widespread rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches, with locally
higher amounts, may lead to isolated instances of flash flooding.
A Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued
for today across New England and for Saturday throughout most of
Maine and coastal sections of New England. Farther south, this
same cold front is currently draped over southern Florida and will
be the focus for multiple rounds of showers and thunderstorms
through the weekend across the southern half of the peninsula. The
biggest concern with these storms will be the possibility of flash
and urban flooding.

Elsewhere, an unsettled weather pattern is in store for the
Southwest thanks to a nearby upper-level low pressure system
helping funnel monsoonal moisture into the region. Scattered
showers and thunderstorms are forecast to potentially impact parts
of Arizona, southwest New Mexico, and the Low Desert of Southern
California. A few of these storms could produce intense rainfall
rates and result in flash flooding. To highlight the concern, a
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall has been issued for today and
Saturday across this section of the country.

Temperature-wise, outside of New England much of the East will
enjoy temperatures near or slightly below average through this
upcoming weekend under a controlling high pressure system. The
opposite is in store for the central U.S., as comfortable
temperatures today are set to be replaced by well above average
temperatures on Saturday. This is especially the case across the
Northern Plains with highs jumping into the 80s by Saturday
(nearly 20 degrees warmer than today).

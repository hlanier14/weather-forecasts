Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1131 AM CDT Wed Jun 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

Major change to the isolated dry thunderstorm area was an expansion
eastward to include more of Colorado and into far southeast Wyoming
and southwest Nebraska Panhandle where PWAT values are forecast to
be less than 0.75 and thus dry thunderstorms are most likely.
Otherwise, the largest change was to expand the northern Plains
elevated southeastward into northwest South Dakota. Morning forecast
guidance indicates 15+ mph winds and RH of 20 to 25 percent
extending farther southeast than previous guidance had indicated.

Strong offshore flow continues in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara
counties with multiple RAWS sites showing 30 to 40 mph winds and
relative humidity between 20 and 30 percent. Expect these winds to
subside through the day.

..Bentley.. 06/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1257 AM CDT Wed Jun 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Partial upper-level ridge breakdown will continue for today as an
upper-level trough, currently moving east over the northern Rockies,
continues to translate into the northern Plains. An attendant
surface low and trailing cold front/trough will likewise continue to
the east through the day. The displacement of stronger upper-level
flow and tighter surface pressure gradients from the drier air mass
and favorable fuels to the west will limit the potential for a
robust fire weather threat. But the diurnal deepening of a thermal
low over the lower Colorado River Valley and building high pressure
along the West Coast will support several areas of elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Great Basin into the northern Rockies...
Areas of elevated fire weather conditions appear likely this
afternoon for much of the Great Basin and parts of the northern
Rockies as RH values fall into the single digits and low teens area
wide. Downslope winds in the lee of the Sierra Nevada will drive
15-20 mph winds along the CA/NV border, and similar sustained winds
are expected further east/northeast across the Great Basin and
northern Rockies as the regional pressure gradient tightens. Areas
of east-central NV, northeast UT, and southwest WY may see frequent
gusts upwards of 25-30 mph in terrain-favored locations by early
afternoon. This may support periods of critical wind/RH conditions,
but the potential for widespread critical conditions is low given
weak flow aloft.

...Northern Montana...
Post-frontal winds are forecast to be sustained at 15-25 mph across
northern and northeast MT early this morning, but are forecast to
gradually abate through the day as the surface low shifts east into
the Plains. Diurnal warming will drive RH reductions into the 20-30%
range by mid/late afternoon, but winds by this time will most likely
be near 15 mph across the region. This temporal displacement of
stronger winds and low RH suggest low potential for sustained
critical conditions, but elevated wind/RH combinations seem likely
with localized critical combinations possible.

...Southern California...
The thermal low across the southern CO River Valley is forecast to
extend along the CA coast as temperatures climb into the upper 90s
and low 100s. Building high pressure across CA's Central Valley will
support an offshore wind gradient with 15-25 mph winds likely. RH
values falling into the 15-20% range and dry fuels will support
elevated fire weather conditions.

...Four Corners...
Mid-level moisture lingers over the southeastern quadrants of the
Four Corners region as sampled by 00Z regional soundings and recent
GOES PWAT imagery thanks to modest moisture advection within a mean
easterly flow regime. This moisture, combined with deep
boundary-layer mixing from strong diurnal heating, will support
thermodynamic profiles favorable for convection again this
afternoon. Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will be driven
primarily by orographic ascent. With dry lightning observed in
recent days under similar conditions, another day of dry lightning
strikes seems likely.

To the south along the AZ/NM border, southeasterly winds will
increase in response to the deepening thermal low to the west. Winds
will likely increase to near 15 mph by early afternoon and support
elevated fire weather conditions given single digit to low teen RH
values.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California into the weekend
followed by a cooler trend...

...Tropical system to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to Central
Gulf Coast and Southeast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...

Extreme heat continues over the Southwest U.S. and California
through Saturday thanks to the persistent upper level ridging over
the West. Some moderation in temperatures is expected though later
in the weekend and next week as the ridging is gradually replaced
with an upper trough forecast to approach the California coast.
Until then, some much above normal temperatures of 10F to 20F will
remain likely for the Great Basin and portions of the Northwest.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, developing troughing over the
central/east U.S. will parade a few cold fronts through the region
and could spell some locally heavy rainfall over the course of
several days. Finally, a tropical disturbance is expected to
approach the west-central Gulf Coast later this week and weekend
and will bring some significant rainfall totals to the area. This
is likely to lead to flooding along portions of the central Gulf
Coast as well as inland across portions of the Southeast.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The model guidance has improved and clustered somewhat with the
track and timing of the potential tropical system current in the
Bay of Campeche forecast to drift northward toward the
west-central Gulf later this week. Compared to the previous
forecast cycle, only minor nudges to the east were needed for the
day 3 position and the forecast favored a GFS/ECMWF blend. The CMC
and UKMET continued to be on the slightly slower/southwestward
side of the model envelope, but that spread has lessened in the
last few cycles. The system will weaken as it moves inland over
Alabama this weekend then become absorbed in the mean flow over
the Carolinas before moving offshore. The ECMWF still wants to
hold onto a stronger low center as it lifts northeastward through
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic but for now, in coordination with
NHC, a weaker system is the preference.

A blend of the latest GFS/ECMWF was the preferred approach for a
consensus based forecast approach for the rest of the CONUS. The
leading shortwave crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast along with
associated front, plus the trailing upper trough that amplifies
into the central/eastern U.S. during the first half of next week,
are agreeable in concept. Shortwave energy helping to carve out
the deepening central U.S. trough will spawn a deepening low
pressure system Sunday into early next week. As it approaches the
Great Lakes, guidance all points to a sub-1000 mb low by Monday.
Its associated cold front will sweep through the central U.S. with
sprawling high pressure overtaking the central U.S. by the middle
of next week. Meanwhile, a West Coast trough will settle offshore
California and the latest model guidance shows fairly
good/agreeable support here such that a general model blend was
sufficient.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record breaking and dangerous heat should continue into Saturday
over the Southwest, California Central Valley, and Interior West
where highs well into the 100s and 110s are likely. This region
should begin to see temperatures moderating a little on Sunday and
to a greater extent during the first half of next week. Meanwhile
areas to the north will trend hotter into early next week with
some areas seeing highs reach into the 90s and possibly low 100s
as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are 10F to 20F
or so above normal and could produce a few isolated daily records.
The combination of extreme temperatures and duration will make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups. Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
the California Central Valley through Saturday.  For the central
and eastern U.S., the combination of frontal passages, potential
for scattered to numerous daily thunderstorms, and a looming
tropical system will likely keep temperatures at or slightly below
the mid/late June normals. The broadest area of cool readings will
progress from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
Monday-Wednesday.

There is increasing concern for potentially significant flooding
impacts resulting from heavy rainfall associated with the tropical
system across the Central Gulf Coast beginning Friday and this
flooding threat then spreads inland across portions of the
Southeast this weekend. Given the much above normal rainfall seen
this spring contributing to high/wet soil moisture content, there
is concern for some significant flooding impacts.

A leading front that settles from the Plains into Mid-Atlantic
this weekend followed by strengthening Plains through Upper Great
Lakes low pressure that returns the first front northward and then
sweeps a cold front through the central/eastern states early next
week will produce multiple rounds of showers/storms.  Some of this
rain may be heavy. Also worth monitoring will be to what extent
the moisture from the tropical system may interact with the second
front as it reaches the eastern U.S.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 161839
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: An amplified pattern is predicted across the North Pacific during
week-2, with a more zonal pattern forecast over the contiguous U.S. Mid-level
high pressure off the west coast of the contiguous U.S. favors a continuation
of anomalously warm temperatures across much of the West. Weak mid-level low
pressure forecast near the California coast at the start of the period is
likely to provide some relief from the heat across California and the
Southwest
initially. The combination of this feature weakening and broad mid-level high
pressure expanding across the southern tier of the contiguous U.S. ultimately
favors increased chances of hazardous heat expanding through these areas as
the
period progresses.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the western CONUS, and the
central and southern High Plains, Thu-Wed, Jun 24-30.

Flooding possible for portions of eastern Texas, southeastern Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the western Florida Panhandle.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY JUNE 19 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pjHpXa-FCzNuewJnOhLqhwQuRTxu5rqgYb9y4kLlIeIL_WJO3v1rDuWkNTh_f_eGb7_UnweS$

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 24 - WEDNESDAY JUNE 30: An amplified 500-hPa height pattern
is forecast across the North Pacific during week-2, with troughing across the
Bering Sea and ridging downstream over the Northeast Pacific. Weak troughing
is
initially forecast underneath this ridge, with the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF
ensembles depicting slightly negative 500-hPa height anomalies off the
California coast at the end of week-1. A more zonal pattern is forecast across
the remainder of the CONUS, with todays guidance favoring weak long wave
troughing to develop across the east-central CONUS by the middle of the
period.
This would retrograde the subtropical ridge further to the west, resulting in
a
trend toward warmer temperatures across California and the Desert Southwest,
as
the initial troughing near California dissipates. This evolution supports a
slight risk for excessive heat across a large area of the western CONUS, and
extending into the Central and Southern High Plains for all of week-2.
Portions
of the Northwest are still favored to be underneath the influence of the
Northeast Pacific ridge, and the broad subtropical ridging forecast to expand
across the south-central and southwestern states favors an increased risk for
hazardous temperatures across the Central and Southern Rockies and High
Plains,
and into California and the Desert Southwest by the middle of the period. Both
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance that
maximum
temperatures exceed the 85th percentile across these areas during week-2,
supporting a slight risk for excessive heat for the entire period. The timing
in the GEFS reforecast tool is slightly faster in terms of the heat expanding
into the Southwest and California, with elevated excessive heat probabilities
beginning on day-9 (6/25) versus days 10-11 (6/26-6/27) in the ECMWF
reforecast
tool. The primary hazard concern is the increased potential for maximum
temperatures exceeding 90 deg F in the valleys of the Rockies and Great Basin,
100 deg F over the central and southern High Plains and the Central Valley of
California, and 110 deg F across the Desert Southwest. Combined with below
normal precipitation favored during late June, the anomalously warm
temperatures are expected to worsen drought conditions being felt throughout
many portions of the western CONUS.



The National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring a tropical disturbance,
currently over the Bay of Campeche, which is forecast to move northward toward
the central Gulf Coast states. Currently, this system has a 90% chance to
develop into a tropical cyclone in the next 5 days. Regardless of its
development, heavy rain is likely across the Gulf Coast in week-1, with the
Weather Prediction Center forecasting 5-10 inches of rain over southeastern
Louisiana and southern Mississippi and Alabama through the end of week-1.
River
flooding remains a concern across the Gulf of Mexico coastal region where this
antecedent heavy rainfall, combined with high soil moistures, supports the
continuation of flooding possible hazard highlighted over portions of eastern
Texas, southeastern Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and the western
Florida Panhandle.



The aforementioned weak longwave troughing forecast to develop in the
east-central CONUS may result in transient shortwave disturbances and frontal
systems tracking across the Midwest and eventually toward the East Coast.
While
some enhanced chances of rainfall are possible as these systems pass through,
there is no coherent signal in the model guidance in terms of exact spatial
coverage and timing to designate a related hazard. Seasonable temperatures are
indicated for much of the eastern CONUS and Midwest, with excessive heat
looking unlikely over these areas heading into the final week of June.



Much of Alaska is forecast to experience anomalous 500-hPa ridging, resulting
in a tilt toward near to above-normal temperatures being favored statewide.
Early in the period, a tight pressure gradient is favored along the southern
coast of the Mainland and the Alaska Peninsula with surface low pressure
forecast over the Bering Sea resulting in enhanced precipitation chances along
with increased wind speeds. However, hazards thresholds are not expected to be
reached. Drier conditions are forecast later in the period as surface high
pressure becomes more established over the Gulf of Alaska, although any
convection that develops could be a concern given the associated lightning
potential and the forecast period coinciding with the climatological peak of
fire season.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed June 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered  over the western Aleutians, and a ridge with
above
normal 500-hPa heights over the Gulf of Alaska, extending to  the Pacific
Northwest. Downstream a weak  ridge is forecast over the western CONUS, while
an amplified  trough is over the east-central CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights.

The predicted troughing over the western Aleutians associated with southerly
to
southwesterly flow favors relatively warm conditions for northern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted trough over the east-central
CONUS
favors enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures across most
of the central and eastern CONUS, except for parts of the Northeast where
above
normal temperatures are indicated due to predicted positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Above normal temperatures are also likely over much of the western
CONUS, parts of the Southern Plains and Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the western Aleutians favors above-normal
precipitation over the Aleutians and much of Mainland Alaska. Anomalous
ridging
and northerly flow increase chances of near to below-normal precipitation
across parts of  eastern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, parts of the
northwestern CONUS, Northern Plains and southwestern CONUS.  Predicted
troughing over the east-central CONUS favors near to above normal
precipitation
across most of the eastern CONUS except for southern Florida , where below
normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 24 - 30 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS but remaining amplified over the Northern Pacific,
while
ensemble spread and uncertainty increases.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska
and
the Alaska Panhandle, associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean
trough over the western Aleutians and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near
to above-normal temperatures are likely over the western half of theCONUS and
parts of southern Florida, under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below
normal temperatures are mostly favored over the remainder eastern half of the
CONUS, as a trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The above normal week-2 precipitation probability is enhanced over much of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians due to forecast troughing over the western
Aleutians with mean southerly flow. Near to below-normal precipitation odds
are
increased for the Alaska Panhandle and most of  the western CONUS as well as
the southern Plains , associated with mean ridging over the Gulf of Alaska and
the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is favored across parts
of the Northern High Plains, the central and eastern CONUS, consistent with
the
ERF consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is indicated over the
Northern American monsoon region related to the southerly flow active during
this period.  Below normal precipitation is also indicated over southern
Florida and parts of the Northern Plain, consistent with operational autoblend
forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California into the weekend
followed by a cooler trend...

...Tropical system to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to Central
Gulf Coast and Southeast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...

Extreme heat continues over the Southwest U.S. and California
through Saturday thanks to the persistent upper level ridging over
the West. Some moderation in temperatures is expected though later
in the weekend and next week as the ridging is gradually replaced
with an upper trough forecast to approach the California coast.
Until then, some much above normal temperatures of 10F to 20F will
remain likely for the Great Basin and portions of the Northwest.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, developing troughing over the
central/east U.S. will parade a few cold fronts through the region
and could spell some locally heavy rainfall over the course of
several days. Finally, a tropical disturbance is expected to
approach the west-central Gulf Coast later this week and weekend
and will bring some significant rainfall totals to the area. This
is likely to lead to flooding along portions of the central Gulf
Coast as well as inland across portions of the Southeast.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The model guidance has improved and clustered somewhat with the
track and timing of the potential tropical system current in the
Bay of Campeche forecast to drift northward toward the
west-central Gulf later this week. Compared to the previous
forecast cycle, only minor nudges to the east were needed for the
day 3 position and the forecast favored a GFS/ECMWF blend. The CMC
and UKMET continued to be on the slightly slower/southwestward
side of the model envelope, but that spread has lessened in the
last few cycles. The system will weaken as it moves inland over
Alabama this weekend then become absorbed in the mean flow over
the Carolinas before moving offshore. The ECMWF still wants to
hold onto a stronger low center as it lifts northeastward through
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic but for now, in coordination with
NHC, a weaker system is the preference.

A blend of the latest GFS/ECMWF was the preferred approach for a
consensus based forecast approach for the rest of the CONUS. The
leading shortwave crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast along with
associated front, plus the trailing upper trough that amplifies
into the central/eastern U.S. during the first half of next week,
are agreeable in concept. Shortwave energy helping to carve out
the deepening central U.S. trough will spawn a deepening low
pressure system Sunday into early next week. As it approaches the
Great Lakes, guidance all points to a sub-1000 mb low by Monday.
Its associated cold front will sweep through the central U.S. with
sprawling high pressure overtaking the central U.S. by the middle
of next week. Meanwhile, a West Coast trough will settle offshore
California and the latest model guidance shows fairly
good/agreeable support here such that a general model blend was
sufficient.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record breaking and dangerous heat should continue into Saturday
over the Southwest, California Central Valley, and Interior West
where highs well into the 100s and 110s are likely. This region
should begin to see temperatures moderating a little on Sunday and
to a greater extent during the first half of next week. Meanwhile
areas to the north will trend hotter into early next week with
some areas seeing highs reach into the 90s and possibly low 100s
as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are 10F to 20F
or so above normal and could produce a few isolated daily records.
The combination of extreme temperatures and duration will make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups. Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
the California Central Valley through Saturday.  For the central
and eastern U.S., the combination of frontal passages, potential
for scattered to numerous daily thunderstorms, and a looming
tropical system will likely keep temperatures at or slightly below
the mid/late June normals. The broadest area of cool readings will
progress from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
Monday-Wednesday.

There is increasing concern for potentially significant flooding
impacts resulting from heavy rainfall associated with the tropical
system across the Central Gulf Coast beginning Friday and this
flooding threat then spreads inland across portions of the
Southeast this weekend. Given the much above normal rainfall seen
this spring contributing to high/wet soil moisture content, there
is concern for some significant flooding impacts.

A leading front that settles from the Plains into Mid-Atlantic
this weekend followed by strengthening Plains through Upper Great
Lakes low pressure that returns the first front northward and then
sweeps a cold front through the central/eastern states early next
week will produce multiple rounds of showers/storms.  Some of this
rain may be heavy. Also worth monitoring will be to what extent
the moisture from the tropical system may interact with the second
front as it reaches the eastern U.S.

...Dangerous and record-breaking heat to continue across portions
of the West and Central Plains...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms possible throughout the
Midwest on Thursday and Ohio Valley on Friday...

...Thunderstorms and scattered flash flooding expected across
Florida this evening, as tropical rains approach the central Gulf
Coast by Friday...

The persistent and extreme heat wave being felt across the western
U.S. is set to continue and even expand over the next couple of
days. A strong upper-level ridge over the Southwest is expected to
remain in place through Friday, while only slightly weakening.
High temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average will spread into
central and northern California on Thursday, before reaching
portions of the northern Great Basin by Friday. Dangerous and
potentially deadly heat will continue throughout the Southwest and
Intermountain West during this time period as well. Highs into the
110s and low 120s are likely throughout the Desert Southwest.
Meanwhile, widespread triple digits will be felt throughout
California and lower elevations of the central Great Basin and
central Rockies. A brief period of sweltering heat will also
impact areas farther east across the central Plains to end the
workweek. High temperatures into the upper 90s and low 100s will
stretch from eastern Colorado to southern Illinois. Much of the
aforementioned regions from the West to Midwest will see dozens of
daily record high temperatures set. A few monthly and even
all-time records have already been tied/broken this week
associated with the current stretch of heat. Widespread Excessive
Heat Warnings and Heat Advisories are in effect throughout
California, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. Residents enduring the
abnormal heat are urged to stay hydrated and avoid extended
periods of time outdoors if possible. With warm temperatures and
dry soil in place, an elevated fire risk is in effect throughout
portions of the Rockies and Intermountain West.

A weak area of low pressure and associated frontal boundaries will
fuel scattered showers and thunderstorms over the Midwest on
Thursday. A few of these storms will be capable of producing
damaging wind gusts, large hail, flash flooding, and isolated
tornadoes. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted an area
that includes northern/central Iowa, southern Minnesota, northern
Illinois, and southern Wisconsin as having the greatest chances
for severe weather on Thursday. By Friday the severe weather and
flash flooding threat is expected to shift eastward into the Ohio
Valley. SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms that
extends from central Illinois to western Pennsylvania. WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Friday over a very
similar area throughout the Ohio Valley.

Active weather is also in store for the Gulf Coast States over the
next few days and potentially into the weekend. Scattered
thunderstorms across the Florida Peninsula will potentially lead
to flash flooding this evening, particularly throughout the
southern half of the Sunshine State. Meanwhile, the National
Hurricane Center has highlighted an area of unsettled weather
currently located over the southwest Gulf of Mexico as having a 70
percent chance of forming into a tropical cyclone over the next 48
hours. Regardless of formation into an organized system, heavy
rain is likely to encroach upon the central Gulf Coast by Friday
afternoon/evening. Much of southern Louisiana has received double
their normal rainfall over the last month; therefore, if any
tropical moisture enters the region it would likely exacerbate
flooding concerns.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN WYOMING...

Expanded the elevated area to include the Snake River Plain based on
forecast 15 to 20 mph winds amid less than 10 percent RH.

In addition, added a critical area to southern Wyoming. Sustained
winds are forecast 25 to 30 mph with gusts as high as 45 mph along
the I-80 corridor in southern Wyoming. Guidance regarding fuel
receptiveness has been mixed, but recent 1000+ acre fires near the
Big Horn mountains in areas showing similar fuel receptiveness lend
support for more critical fuels. Therefore, based on this evidence
and collaboration with fuels guidance, local WFOs, and regional
GACCs, it was deemed fuels are sufficiently dry to warrant a
critical delineation.

Finally, added an elevated area in northeast Nevada where winds are
forecast to be 15 to 20 mph with relative humidity in the single
digits.

Expanded the isolated dry thunderstorm area westward to include much
of southern Nevada into the Sierra and parts of southern California.
Lightning may be very isolated across this region, but there appears
to be enough of a mid-level moisture push to support at least some
convection capable of lightning production.

..Bentley.. 06/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Wed Jun 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strong zonal flow aloft will persist over the northern Rockies into
Thursday. This will support strong mid-level winds from Wyoming into
Montana and western North Dakota, which will help support areas of
elevated fire weather concerns given the receptive fuels. Mid-level
moisture will continue to linger across the Four Corners region
under an upper-level high, supporting another day of dry
thunderstorm potential.

...Northern Rockies and northern High Plains...
Westerly surface winds are expected across the northern Rockies and
northern High Plains as a surface trough stalls to the east across
the Plains and high pressure builds over the Pacific Northwest.
Sustained winds near 15-20 mph are probable, and strong mid-level
flow may mix down as frequent gusts to 25-35 mph given sufficiently
deep boundary-layer mixing. With afternoon RH values in the teens to
low twenties expected and receptive fuels already in place, elevated
conditions appear likely. Locations along the I-80 corridor in
south-central WY will see the highest potential for critical
conditions as downslope winds support strong warming/drying as well
as wind gusts up to 45 mph. However, recent fuel reports from this
area suggest fuels are not as receptive as areas further north,
precluding a critical risk delineation at this time (though an
upgrade is possible pending new fuel reports).

...Four Corners...
A persistent upper-level high over the Four Corners will continue to
allow mid-level moisture return from the southern Plains into
central AZ, NM, and central CO. Forecast soundings show sufficient
instability above deep, well-mixed boundary layers with mean
boundary-layer RH values near 20% and PWAT values between 0.4 to
0.6. This suggests a mixture of wet and dry storms is possible, and
given recent dry lightning activity under similar thermodynamic
conditions in recent days, at least a few dry strikes seem likely.

...Great Basin...
Dry conditions will persist across much of the Great Basin for
Thursday. Afternoon RH values in the single digits are expected, and
fuels will remain receptive after several days of hot/dry
conditions. Weak upper-level flow aloft will limit the potential for
widespread fire weather concerns, but winds up to 15 mph are
possible, especially in terrain-favored locations, which should
support patchy elevated conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed June 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a broad trough over
the North Pacific, centered  over the western Aleutians, and a ridge with
above
normal 500-hPa heights over the Gulf of Alaska, extending to  the Pacific
Northwest. Downstream a weak  ridge is forecast over the western CONUS, while
an amplified  trough is over the east-central CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights.

The predicted troughing over the western Aleutians associated with southerly
to
southwesterly flow favors relatively warm conditions for northern Mainland
Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. A predicted trough over the east-central
CONUS
favors enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures across most
of the central and eastern CONUS, except for parts of the Northeast where
above
normal temperatures are indicated due to predicted positive 500-hPa height
anomalies. Above normal temperatures are also likely over much of the western
CONUS, parts of the Southern Plains and Florida Peninsula, consistent with the
ERF consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the western Aleutians favors above-normal
precipitation over the Aleutians and much of Mainland Alaska. Anomalous
ridging
and northerly flow increase chances of near to below-normal precipitation
across parts of  eastern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, parts of the
northwestern CONUS, Northern Plains and southwestern CONUS.  Predicted
troughing over the east-central CONUS favors near to above normal
precipitation
across most of the eastern CONUS except for southern Florida , where below
normal precipitation is indicated, consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Yesterday's
12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 24 - 30 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
forecast
to persist but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period, becoming more zonal
over much of the CONUS but remaining amplified over the Northern Pacific,
while
ensemble spread and uncertainty increases.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska
and
the Alaska Panhandle, associated with mean southerly flow ahead of a mean
trough over the western Aleutians and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Near
to above-normal temperatures are likely over the western half of theCONUS and
parts of southern Florida, under near to above normal 500-hPa heights. Below
normal temperatures are mostly favored over the remainder eastern half of the
CONUS, as a trough and storm systems are predicted to traverse the region.

The above normal week-2 precipitation probability is enhanced over much of
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians due to forecast troughing over the western
Aleutians with mean southerly flow. Near to below-normal precipitation odds
are
increased for the Alaska Panhandle and most of  the western CONUS as well as
the southern Plains , associated with mean ridging over the Gulf of Alaska and
the western CONUS. Near to above normal precipitation is favored across parts
of the Northern High Plains, the central and eastern CONUS, consistent with
the
ERF consolidation tool. Above normal precipitation is indicated over the
Northern American monsoon region related to the southerly flow active during
this period.  Below normal precipitation is also indicated over southern
Florida and parts of the Northern Plain, consistent with operational autoblend
forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California into the weekend
followed by a cooler trend...

...Tropical system to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to Central
Gulf Coast and Southeast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...

Extreme heat continues over the Southwest U.S. and California
through Saturday thanks to the persistent upper level ridging over
the West. Some moderation in temperatures is expected though later
in the weekend and next week as the ridging is gradually replaced
with an upper trough forecast to approach the California coast.
Until then, some much above normal temperatures of 10F to 20F will
remain likely for the Great Basin and portions of the Northwest.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, developing troughing over the
central/east U.S. will parade a few cold fronts through the region
and could spell some locally heavy rainfall over the course of
several days. Finally, a tropical disturbance is expected to
approach the west-central Gulf Coast later this week and weekend
and will bring some significant rainfall totals to the area. This
is likely to lead to flooding along portions of the central Gulf
Coast as well as inland across portions of the Southeast.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The model guidance has improved and clustered somewhat with the
track and timing of the potential tropical system current in the
Bay of Campeche forecast to drift northward toward the
west-central Gulf later this week. Compared to the previous
forecast cycle, only minor nudges to the east were needed for the
day 3 position and the forecast favored a GFS/ECMWF blend. The CMC
and UKMET continued to be on the slightly slower/southwestward
side of the model envelope, but that spread has lessened in the
last few cycles. The system will weaken as it moves inland over
Alabama this weekend then become absorbed in the mean flow over
the Carolinas before moving offshore. The ECMWF still wants to
hold onto a stronger low center as it lifts northeastward through
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic but for now, in coordination with
NHC, a weaker system is the preference.

A blend of the latest GFS/ECMWF was the preferred approach for a
consensus based forecast approach for the rest of the CONUS. The
leading shortwave crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast along with
associated front, plus the trailing upper trough that amplifies
into the central/eastern U.S. during the first half of next week,
are agreeable in concept. Shortwave energy helping to carve out
the deepening central U.S. trough will spawn a deepening low
pressure system Sunday into early next week. As it approaches the
Great Lakes, guidance all points to a sub-1000 mb low by Monday.
Its associated cold front will sweep through the central U.S. with
sprawling high pressure overtaking the central U.S. by the middle
of next week. Meanwhile, a West Coast trough will settle offshore
California and the latest model guidance shows fairly
good/agreeable support here such that a general model blend was
sufficient.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record breaking and dangerous heat should continue into Saturday
over the Southwest, California Central Valley, and Interior West
where highs well into the 100s and 110s are likely. This region
should begin to see temperatures moderating a little on Sunday and
to a greater extent during the first half of next week. Meanwhile
areas to the north will trend hotter into early next week with
some areas seeing highs reach into the 90s and possibly low 100s
as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are 10F to 20F
or so above normal and could produce a few isolated daily records.
The combination of extreme temperatures and duration will make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups. Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
the California Central Valley through Saturday.  For the central
and eastern U.S., the combination of frontal passages, potential
for scattered to numerous daily thunderstorms, and a looming
tropical system will likely keep temperatures at or slightly below
the mid/late June normals. The broadest area of cool readings will
progress from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
Monday-Wednesday.

There is increasing concern for potentially significant flooding
impacts resulting from heavy rainfall associated with the tropical
system across the Central Gulf Coast beginning Friday and this
flooding threat then spreads inland across portions of the
Southeast this weekend. Given the much above normal rainfall seen
this spring contributing to high/wet soil moisture content, there
is concern for some significant flooding impacts.

A leading front that settles from the Plains into Mid-Atlantic
this weekend followed by strengthening Plains through Upper Great
Lakes low pressure that returns the first front northward and then
sweeps a cold front through the central/eastern states early next
week will produce multiple rounds of showers/storms.  Some of this
rain may be heavy. Also worth monitoring will be to what extent
the moisture from the tropical system may interact with the second
front as it reaches the eastern U.S.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat for the Southwest/California into the weekend
followed by a cooler trend...

...Tropical system to bring heavy rainfall and flooding to Central
Gulf Coast and Southeast Friday and this weekend...

...Overview...

Extreme heat continues over the Southwest U.S. and California
through Saturday thanks to the persistent upper level ridging over
the West. Some moderation in temperatures is expected though later
in the weekend and next week as the ridging is gradually replaced
with an upper trough forecast to approach the California coast.
Until then, some much above normal temperatures of 10F to 20F will
remain likely for the Great Basin and portions of the Northwest.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, developing troughing over the
central/east U.S. will parade a few cold fronts through the region
and could spell some locally heavy rainfall over the course of
several days. Finally, a tropical disturbance is expected to
approach the west-central Gulf Coast later this week and weekend
and will bring some significant rainfall totals to the area. This
is likely to lead to flooding along portions of the central Gulf
Coast as well as inland across portions of the Southeast.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The model guidance has improved and clustered somewhat with the
track and timing of the potential tropical system current in the
Bay of Campeche forecast to drift northward toward the
west-central Gulf later this week. Compared to the previous
forecast cycle, only minor nudges to the east were needed for the
day 3 position and the forecast favored a GFS/ECMWF blend. The CMC
and UKMET continued to be on the slightly slower/southwestward
side of the model envelope, but that spread has lessened in the
last few cycles. The system will weaken as it moves inland over
Alabama this weekend then become absorbed in the mean flow over
the Carolinas before moving offshore. The ECMWF still wants to
hold onto a stronger low center as it lifts northeastward through
the Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic but for now, in coordination with
NHC, a weaker system is the preference.

A blend of the latest GFS/ECMWF was the preferred approach for a
consensus based forecast approach for the rest of the CONUS. The
leading shortwave crossing the Great Lakes/Northeast along with
associated front, plus the trailing upper trough that amplifies
into the central/eastern U.S. during the first half of next week,
are agreeable in concept. Shortwave energy helping to carve out
the deepening central U.S. trough will spawn a deepening low
pressure system Sunday into early next week. As it approaches the
Great Lakes, guidance all points to a sub-1000 mb low by Monday.
Its associated cold front will sweep through the central U.S. with
sprawling high pressure overtaking the central U.S. by the middle
of next week. Meanwhile, a West Coast trough will settle offshore
California and the latest model guidance shows fairly
good/agreeable support here such that a general model blend was
sufficient.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Record breaking and dangerous heat should continue into Saturday
over the Southwest, California Central Valley, and Interior West
where highs well into the 100s and 110s are likely. This region
should begin to see temperatures moderating a little on Sunday and
to a greater extent during the first half of next week. Meanwhile
areas to the north will trend hotter into early next week with
some areas seeing highs reach into the 90s and possibly low 100s
as far north as eastern Washington. These readings are 10F to 20F
or so above normal and could produce a few isolated daily records.
The combination of extreme temperatures and duration will make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups. Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
the California Central Valley through Saturday.  For the central
and eastern U.S., the combination of frontal passages, potential
for scattered to numerous daily thunderstorms, and a looming
tropical system will likely keep temperatures at or slightly below
the mid/late June normals. The broadest area of cool readings will
progress from the northern Plains into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
Monday-Wednesday.

There is increasing concern for potentially significant flooding
impacts resulting from heavy rainfall associated with the tropical
system across the Central Gulf Coast beginning Friday and this
flooding threat then spreads inland across portions of the
Southeast this weekend. Given the much above normal rainfall seen
this spring contributing to high/wet soil moisture content, there
is concern for some significant flooding impacts.

A leading front that settles from the Plains into Mid-Atlantic
this weekend followed by strengthening Plains through Upper Great
Lakes low pressure that returns the first front northward and then
sweeps a cold front through the central/eastern states early next
week will produce multiple rounds of showers/storms.  Some of this
rain may be heavy. Also worth monitoring will be to what extent
the moisture from the tropical system may interact with the second
front as it reaches the eastern U.S.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1250 AM CDT Thu Jun 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH CENTRAL WYOMING...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level high will remain over the Four Corners region today,
allowing for strong diurnal heating and the deepening of a thermal
trough over the Four Corners/Great Basin region. To the north,
pressure gradient winds will increase through the day as surface
high pressure builds over the Pacific Northwest with a lingering low
over the Plains. This will support elevated to critical fire weather
conditions across the northern Great Basin and into the northern
Rockies/High Plains.

...Central to Northern Rockies and Great Basin...
Dry conditions will persist for much of the northern Great Basin and
into the northern Rockies, and active fires within the region over
the past few days are indicative of receptive fuels. Afternoon RH
values in the single digits are expected across NV/UT, increasing to
the teens and low 20s with northward extent into northern MT and
western ND. The synoptic pressure gradient over the northern Great
Basin and central/northern Rockies will be augmented by early
afternoon as boundary-layer mixing transports stronger mid-level
flow to the surface. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph (gusting to
25-35 mph) will support areas of elevated conditions. Critical
conditions remain likely across south-central WY where terrain
influences will regionally strengthen winds to 20-25 mph (with gusts
up to 40-45 mph possible) along the I-80 corridor.

...Southwest...
Evening soundings from across the Four Corners region show mid-level
moisture atop of deep, well-mixed boundary layers with 100-500 J/kg
MUCAPE. This environment supported isolated to scattered
thunderstorms Wednesday afternoon, and despite some convective
overturning, mean easterly winds into NM/AZ will continue to supply
mid-level moisture and maintain favorable thermodynamic profiles for
thunderstorms this afternoon. Strong heating coupled with orographic
ascent will favor isolated, to perhaps scattered, thunderstorms
across the broader Southwest/Four Corners region. PWAT values
between 0.5 to 0.75 inches suggest a mix of wet and dry storms.

...Southern Arizona/New Mexico Border...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected this afternoon along
the southern AZ/NM border. Southeasterly winds are forecast to
increase to near 15 mph (with occasional gusts upwards of 25 mph) in
response to the deepening thermal low to the west. Single digit to
low teen RH values are expected, and fuels remain receptive per
recent fire activity.

...Northern Michigan...
A dry continental air mass has moved into the central Great Lakes
region on the eastern periphery of a surface high. The approach of a
surface low/trough to the northwest through the day will increase
southwesterly winds to 10-15 mph as RH values fall to near 20%.
10-hour fuel moisture values in the 5-6% range are noted, as well as
high ERC values per recent fuel analyses. Although winds should
generally remain below elevated thresholds, pockets of elevated fire
weather conditions are possible.

...Dangerous heat continues across portions of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat over the Southwest/California through the weekend
and then subsiding next week...

...Tropical system likely reaching the Gulf Coast late this week
to spread heavy rainfall into the Southeast by Sunday...


...Overview...

The extreme heat over the Southwest and California should moderate
after the weekend as an upper ridge over the region gives way to a
trough (likely with an embedded low) that settles just off the
West Coast.  However enough ridging will persist over parts of the
Great Basin/Northwest to support very warm to hot conditions over
those areas, likely peaking early in the week.  A broad mean
trough will prevail farther east with the greatest depth/amplitude
likely to be over the east-central U.S. during the early-mid
portion of next week.  This trough and associated surface
system/fronts will support areas of active weather with potential
for heavy rainfall.  Meanwhile the National Hurricane Center
continues to monitor a broad area of low pressure over the Bay of
Campeche.  During the short-range time frame this feature should
start to organize while tracking northward and bring heavy rain
into the Gulf Coast region, reaching an inland position over the
southern U.S. by the start of the extended period early Sunday.
Expect the heavy rainfall to extend across parts of the Southeast
on Sunday.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Based on data through the 18Z cycle, a blend of 12Z-18Z GFS/12Z
ECMWF runs and 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means (mostly operational model
weight early and about half models/means by days 6-7
Wednesday-Thursday) provided the best overall starting point for
the forecast.  There is still a fair degree of uncertainty over
the specifics of the possible tropical system that may reach into
the South by the start of the period and then continue
northeastward as directed by the southern fringe of the
westerlies.  The new 00Z GFS shifted east of its prior couple
runs.  The CMC and UKMET continue their recent tendency to be on
the fast and slow side respectively.  The ECMWF has been the
deepest with the surface low but the 12Z run represented a weaker
trend from some earlier runs.  The upper trough amplifying east of
the Rockies is handled well in principle but with persistent
shortwave detail differences.  The 12Z UKMET/CMC offered the
possibility of slightly slower upper trough/cold front progression
while their new runs appear to align better to established
consensus.  On the other hand the 00Z GFS becomes a little faster
than the majority.  Guidance continues to refine details a bit for
Sunday-Monday Northern Plains/Upper Great Lakes low pressure.  For
the upper low/trough near the West Coast, latest GFS runs have
strayed a bit north/northeast of consensus by Thursday--likely due
in part to being a little fast with height falls approaching from
the northwest.  Flow over southwest Canada should ultimately trend
toward weak troughing in response to the mean ridge over the
Northeast Pacific but so far guidance has been erratic over this
area.  Preferred model/ensemble consensus suggests this trough
could push a front into the northern High Plains by next Thursday.
 The new 00Z GFS compares much better than prior runs for this
aspect of the forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The record-breaking and dangerous heat continuing into the weekend
over the Southwest and California Central Valley should begin to
moderate a little on Sunday and then subside more dramatically
thereafter with high temperatures trending close to normal by
Tuesday-Thursday.  On the other hand persistence of upper ridging
will support well above normal temperatures from parts of the
Great Basin through the Northwest.  The most extreme anomalies
over the Northwest should be early in the week when parts of
Oregon and Washington could see highs up to 20-25F above normal.
Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible.  By next
Thursday highs of 10-15F above normal should be confined to the
Interior Northwest and northern Rockies.  The amplifying upper
trough to the east early-mid week will produce an area of below
normal temperatures progressing from the Plains into the
east-central U.S., moderating some as it reaches the East Coast
states.  Best potential for at least a day of temperatures 10F or
more below normal will be from the Dakotas into the central High
Plains and eastward into the Great Lakes.

Southern U.S. heavy rainfall and flooding concerns associated with
the tropical system expected to reach the Gulf Coast early in the
weekend should extend into the Southeast by Sunday.  Portions of
the South that have seen well above normal rainfall in recent
weeks will be particularly sensitive to the additional rainfall
from this system.  The amplifying upper trough over the
central/east-central U.S. and leading low pressure/frontal system
should spread a broad area of showers and thunderstorms across the
eastern half of the country.  Some of the rain may be heavy from
the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes as well as the Ohio Valley
or Tennessee Valley into the southern Plains.  The Storm
Prediction Center is also monitoring the potential for organized
severe threats given the vigorous nature of the system.  Thus far
guidance is maintaining some separation between the tropical
moisture over the south and the front that heads into the East by
next Tuesday.  Farther west, areas along eastern slopes of the
northern/central Rockies may see a period of organized rainfall
Sunday-Sunday night with the passage of a cold front and the
shortwave energy aloft feeding into the overall trough to the east.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1105 AM CDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

Visible satellite depicts clear skies along the West Coast, with
METAR observations showing 20+ mph sustained north-northwesterly
winds present across the Sacramento Valley area. Though RH is
currently within the 20-30% range, continued heating/boundary-layer
mixing is expected to foster 15-20% RH during the afternoon (per
latest guidance consensus). As such, Elevated and Critical
highlights have been maintained across portions of northern
California.

Little change has been made to the Elevated and Critical highlights
across the Southwest. Clear skies are evident across the Lower
Colorado River Basin, with METARs showing RH below 20% across
several locales. As stronger flow aloft overspreads a deepening and
mixing boundary layer, widespread 20+ mph sustained westerly surface
winds will develop, with RH likely dropping into the 10-15% range.
Fuels should remain dry enough to support considerable
wildfire-spread potential.

..Squitieri.. 05/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1237 AM CDT Mon May 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough positioned over the Northern Rockies will remain
quasi-stationary throughout the day, resulting in a mostly zonal
flow pattern over much of the central and eastern CONUS. The
exception will be along the West Coast, which will experience more
northerly/northwesterly flow aloft. A mid-level jet streak embedded
in the flow field, featuring 50+ kt winds, will move from parts of
northern California into the Southwest throughout the day. At the
surface, dry/breezy conditions are forecast to prevail over much of
the West.

...Northern California...
With the aforementioned enhanced northerly flow aloft, day time
heating/mixing processes will allow winds aloft to mix toward the
surface. Afternoon sustained northerly surface winds of 20+ mph
(higher gusts in terrain-favored areas) should occur as RH values
fall into the teens amid dry/receptive fuels. Consequently, critical
fire-weather conditions can be expected, from late morning
throughout the afternoon. In proximity to the critical area,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected where the wind/RH
combo will be slightly weaker.

...Southwest...
Enhanced westerly mid-level flow present over the region, combined
with diurnal heating/mixing, should result in widespread sustained
winds of 20-30 mph over the region. Meanwhile, RH values will fall
into the teens and perhaps single digits (mainly across east-central
Arizona into central New Mexico). Fuels across the region remain
receptive to large-fire spread, and thus, critical fire-weather
conditions can be expected for an expansive portion of the region.
Elevated fire-weather conditions will occur in regions surrounding
the critical delineation, where winds and RH values should generally
not exceed critical thresholds, though localized critical conditions
are certainly possible.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: Regions of mid-level high pressure are forecast across the
northeastern Pacific and Great Lakes during Week-2, with mid-level low
pressure
possible across the Intermountain West. An advancing cold front with
accompanying heavy rainfall chances is likely to cross the Central U.S. during
the early portion of the forecast period. Forecast solutions featuring
increased mid-level low pressure across the West would support some risk of
high winds across roughly the southwestern quarter of the Lower-48 states.
Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the Bering Sea which could bring a wet
pattern to the southern coast of Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain across portions of the Central and Southern Plains,
and the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Tue-Wed, May 18-19.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Central Great Basin,
Southwest, Rockies, and High Plains, Tue-Mon, May 18-24.

FOR TUESDAY MAY 18 - MONDAY MAY 24: The Weather Prediction Center (WPC)
surface
analysis for Day 7 shows a surface low pressure center near the Sandhills of
Nebraska with a trailing dry line and cold front extending southward over the
High Plains. As this system transits eastward the cold front is likely to
overcome the dry line and become the primary focus for heavy rainfall concerns
during Week-2. A slight risk of heavy rain is forecast for much of the Central
and Southern Plains and Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley on May 18th and
19th tied to the advancing boundary. Discrepancies exist regarding how
progressive the system is, resulting in a slower advance in the GEFS
(primarily
focused over the Great Plains) versus the quicker ECMWF (targeting the
Mississippi Valley), resulting in the broad shape covering both days. The GEFS
is also quicker to wash out the precipitation risks beyond the 18th, while the
ECMWF lingers precipitation into the 19th, resulting in the two day forecast
period. Flash flooding could be a concern with this system as currently
observed soil moisture levels are generally above normal across the area
highlighted for the hazard, while another 2-4 inches of rain are possible over
the coming week per WPC.



Mid-level low pressure is forecast to varying degrees across the West in the
mean Week-2 circulation field. This feature digs the furthest south in the
ECMWF ensembles, while the Canadian ensembles exhibit similar height
departures
with some northwestward displacement. Conversely, today's 0Z GEFS has only
marginally below-normal heights confined to the Northern Rockies. The more
amplified solutions of the ECMWF and Canadian models would support periodic
high wind risks throughout Week-2 extending across the Southwest, Rockies, and
High Plains depending on the timing of shortwave activity rotating through the
longwave axis. A broad slight risk of high winds is posted for these regions
across the entirety of Week-2 where winds of 35+ knots are possible but
difficult to pinpoint in time and space.



Anomalous mid-level troughing is forecast over the Bering Sea during Week-2,
supportive of a wet pattern for areas adjacent to the Gulf of Alaska and
potentially the Bering Sea. Despite this, it's a relatively dry time of year
for the region and forecast precipitation totals appear unimpressive.
Reforecast guidance for temperature across the state is mixed, with the GEFS
generally favoring near-normal temperatures, while the ECMWF tilts strongly
toward above-normal temperatures for the northern two-thirds of the state. If
the ECMWF solution were to verify this could exacerbate river flooding
concerns
during break-up season for regions north of the Brooks Range.

149 PM EDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 12Z Thu May 13 2021 - 12Z Mon May 17 2021

1800 UTC update...

The models and ensembles continue to show fairly good agreement
(especially the first half of the period) with the overall large
scale pattern, but larger differences in the details. There is not
a whole lot to note with the new 00z/06z guidance, with the same
forecast concerns from the overnight shift as noted below. Given
this, maintained pretty close WPC continuity with no major changes
to the forecast needed. The updated guidance favored a blend
towards the deterministic ECMWF/GFS/CMC/UKMET days 3-5, with more
weight on the ensemble means/ECMWF days 6-7. See previous
discussion copied below for the details.

Santorelli


Previous discussion issued at 0655 UTC...

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show moderate progression to flow
aloft across the lower 48 and vicinity.  Aside from fairly minor
details, there is reasonable consensus for a broad mean trough to
cross the eastern U.S. and emerge into the Atlantic while a
trailing ridge over the West as of Thursday should reach into the
Mississippi Valley by next Monday.  There has been more spread and
variability for details of upstream Pacific energy that should
amplify into an upper trough that reaches/crosses the West during
the weekend, as well as for details of flow behind this feature.
Aside from a front dropping through the Gulf and Florida Peninsula
late this week, waves/fronts will primarily affect the
western/central U.S. as high pressure prevails over the East.
Thus the best focus for precipitation during the period will
likely extend from the northern Rockies through a majority of the
Plains and into the Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley.  Contrasting
temperatures on Thursday, with parts of the West quite warm and
the South/East much cooler than normal, should steadily gravitate
toward climatology with time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

With current model runs still showing minimal surface response to
the upper trough crossing the East aside from waviness well
offshore, the dominant forecast difficulties involve the shortwave
energy expected to move into the West during the weekend and
upstream flow that will affect the pattern behind this energy.
After a couple days of increased spread for where/when features
could try to separate, 12Z/18Z model/ensemble runs (and followed
up in the new 00Z runs) have returned to some variation of 2-3
days ago when there was better clustering toward the idea that any
separation that occurs would wait until energy reaches near the
West Coast.  There are still significant differences for what
individual pieces of energy will do though, and predictability is
low due to their small scale.  A blended approach (more models
than means into day 5 Saturday followed by a more even mix by day
7 Monday) continues to provide the best way to navigate the spread
and variability that the models/ensembles have exhibited so far.

Farther west, recent GFS runs trend out of phase with North
Pacific flow from the weekend onward--a result of western Pacific
flow separation which other guidance does not depict.  In contrast
to the flat flow to ridging that the GFS shows near the West Coast
by next Monday, ECMWF/CMC runs and their ensemble means have been
fairly consistent so far in bringing another trough toward the
West--albeit with detail and amplitude differences.  Latest GEFS
means fall between these two extremes, with a weaker and delayed
trough approaching the West.  Current preference is to tilt the
forecast somewhat more in the direction of the ECMWF cluster
relative to the GFS/GEFS.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect a gradual increase in coverage and amounts for rain and
thunderstorms over the central U.S. and northern Rockies from late
this week into early next week.  Initial activity will be focused
mostly by weak northern stream shortwave impulses and there should
be a relative lack of deep moisture.  Then Gulf moisture should
begin to contribute more and interact with one or more
waves/fronts as eastern U.S. high pressure nears the East Coast.
With uncertainty in the specifics, shortwave energy emerging from
the West late in the period may provide another ingredient in the
rainfall recipe.  Currently expect the highest five-day totals
over portions of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley.  Some precipitation could be in the form of
snow over highest elevations of the northern Rockies.  Any
precipitation farther west should be fairly light and scattered.
The upper trough crossing the East late this week may produce some
areas of mostly light rainfall over central/northern latitudes,
with greater coverage during the latter half of each day.
Locations near the Southeast coast and over the Florida Peninsula
could see somewhat more organized rainfall for a time before a
drier trend, as a wavy front initially over the Gulf and Florida
Peninsula pushes southward.

On Thursday the southern tier will see well below normal highs
with minus 10-20F anomalies over parts of the Southeast and minus
10-15F anomalies over parts of Texas.  Some locations in the
Southeast could challenge daily records for cool highs.  Less
extreme below normal readings should prevail late this week over
the remaining majority of the central/eastern U.S.  Meanwhile
temperatures are likely to be up to 10-20F above normal over areas
from Oregon/California into the Great Basin late this week with
more moderate anomalies stretching into the central Rockies/High
Plains late this week into the weekend.  During the weekend upper
troughing that moves into the West should bring temperatures back
down toward normal across the region from west to east.  The
moderating trends for both cool and warm areas from late this week
may yield highs within a few degrees on either side of normal over
much of the lower 48 by next Monday.

upstream flow that will affect the pattern behind this energy.
After a couple days of increased spread for where/when features
could try to separate, 12Z/18Z model/ensemble runs (and followed
up in the new 00Z runs) have returned to some variation of 2-3
days ago when there was better clustering toward the idea that any
separation that occurs would wait until energy reaches near the
West Coast.  There are still significant differences for what
individual pieces of energy will do though, and predictability is
low due to their small scale.  A blended approach (more models
than means into day 5 Saturday followed by a more even mix by day
7 Monday) continues to provide the best way to navigate the spread
and variability that the models/ensembles have exhibited so far.

Farther west, recent GFS runs trend out of phase with North
Pacific flow from the weekend onward--a result of western Pacific
flow separation which other guidance does not depict.  In contrast
to the flat flow to ridging that the GFS shows near the West Coast
by next Monday, ECMWF/CMC runs and their ensemble means have been
fairly consistent so far in bringing another trough toward the
West--albeit with detail and amplitude differences.  Latest GEFS
means fall between these two extremes, with a weaker and delayed
trough approaching the West.  Current preference is to tilt the
forecast somewhat more in the direction of the ECMWF cluster
relative to the GFS/GEFS.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect a gradual increase in coverage and amounts for rain and
thunderstorms over the central U.S. and northern Rockies from late
this week into early next week.  Initial activity will be focused
mostly by weak northern stream shortwave impulses and there should
be a relative lack of deep moisture.  Then Gulf moisture should
begin to contribute more and interact with one or more
waves/fronts as eastern U.S. high pressure nears the East Coast.
With uncertainty in the specifics, shortwave energy emerging from
the West late in the period may provide another ingredient in the
rainfall recipe.  Currently expect the highest five-day totals
over portions of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley.  Some precipitation could be in the form of
snow over highest elevations of the northern Rockies.  Any
precipitation farther west should be fairly light and scattered.
The upper trough crossing the East late this week may produce some
areas of mostly light rainfall over central/northern latitudes,
with greater coverage during the latter half of each day.
Locations near the Southeast coast and over the Florida Peninsula
could see somewhat more organized rainfall for a time before a
drier trend, as a wavy front initially over the Gulf and Florida
Peninsula pushes southward.

On Thursday the southern tier will see well below normal highs
with minus 10-20F anomalies over parts of the Southeast and minus
10-15F anomalies over parts of Texas.  Some locations in the
Southeast could challenge daily records for cool highs.  Less
extreme below normal readings should prevail late this week over
the remaining majority of the central/eastern U.S.  Meanwhile
temperatures are likely to be up to 10-20F above normal over areas
from Oregon/California into the Great Basin late this week with
more moderate anomalies stretching into the central Rockies/High
Plains late this week into the weekend.  During the weekend upper
troughing that moves into the West should bring temperatures back
down toward normal across the region from west to east.  The
moderating trends for both cool and warm areas from late this week
may yield highs within a few degrees on either side of normal over
much of the lower 48 by next Monday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 16 - 20 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement with
regard to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over North America.
Troughing and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the Bering Sea and eastward across western Alaska. Across the western CONUS,
increased mid-level troughing is predicted, compared to yesterday's 6-10 day
forecast, while in the eastern CONUS, ridging is forecast with positive 500-
hPa
height anomalies.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted across
parts of the Southeast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.
Above
normal temperatures are favored over the Northeast and central CONUS,
extending
westward to the Rockies and parts of the Great Basin, underneath near to above
normal mid-level heights and low level southerly flow. Near to below normal
temperatures are forecast over the West Coast and Alaska Panhandle due to
predicted low level northerly flow over the region.
Near to above normal temperatures are favored across much of Mainland Alaska
and the Aleutians, due to forecast enhanced southerly surface and mid-level
flow ahead of a mean trough over the Bering Sea.

Below normal precipitation is favored over most of the eastern CONUS,
underneath above normal 500-hPa heights. Southerly flow and frontal activities
increase odds of above normal precipitation over the Mississippi Valley, Great
Plains, and the western Great Lakes. Below normal precipitation is favored for
the Southern High Plains, the southern Rockies, and parts of the northwestern
CONUS, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Over central and
southern Alaska, an active storm track is favored on the northern periphery of
the mean Pacific ridge, leading to increased odds of above normal
precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 4 out of 5, due to
decent
agreement in the model mid-level height forecasts, offset by differences among
the forecast tools in the predicted temperature and precipitation fields.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 18 - 24 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the Week-2 period depicts mean
mid-level troughing and weak negative height anomalies across the western
CONUS. Positive height anomalies are predicted elsewhere over the CONUS,
underneath mean ridging and anticyclonic mid-level flow. Over Alaska, negative
500-hPa height anomalies are predicted for much of the Mainland and Aleutians,
associated with mean troughing over the Bering Sea and western Alaska.

Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across parts of the West
Coast and Alaska Panhandle, with increased troughing over the region. Near to
below normal temperatures are predicted over parts of the Southeast,
consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool. As high pressure shifts eastward across
the eastern CONUS throughout the period, return flow from the Gulf of Mexico
on
its western periphery favors increased probabilities of above normal
temperatures for the remainder of the CONUS. Mean southerly to southwesterly
flow favors above normal temperatures across much of the Alaska mainland and
the Aleutians.

Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation for much of the East Coast,
associated with mean surface high pressure. Increased odds of above normal
precipitation in the Central CONUS are associated with southerly flow and
moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico behind surface high pressure in the
Southeast and ahead of a mean mid-level trough over the West. Despite the mean
trough over the Western CONUS, energy crossing the northwestern CONUS and
southern Rockies is not favored to amplify until it reaches the Plains,
leading
to enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities in the northwestern CONUS
and Four Corners and Southern High Rockies. Above normal precipitation chances
continue to be increased over Alaska due to troughing over the Bering Sea and
the west coast of Mainland Alaska and the ridging over the eastern Pacific,
favoring an active storm track across much of Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
day-to-day consistency in the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble model guidance,
offset by continued uncertainty in GEFS and the temperature fields over the
CONUS and Alaska.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0236 PM CDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

An Elevated area was added for portions of the Sacramento Valley,
mainly for tomorrow morning into early afternoon. From roughly
15-20Z, high-resolution guidance shows 15-20 mph sustained northerly
surface winds overlapping with RH under 20% as a modest belt of
30-40 kt 500 mb flow overspreads northern California. While the
favorable winds/RH should only overlap for a few hours, an Elevated
area was added given very receptive fuels in place. Otherwise, the
Elevated across northwestern New Mexico was expanded in area since
the latest guidance shows a larger overlap of 15+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds coinciding with RH under 20%.

Overlapping Elevated winds/RH are expected across northern parts of
the Mid Atlantic into southern New England tomorrow afternoon within
a post-cold frontal environment. However, recent rainfall has likely
dampened fuels enough to reduce the wildfire-spread threat in most
locales, with wildfire-growth potential remaining relatively
localized.

..Squitieri.. 05/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CDT Mon May 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
The predominant zonal flow pattern anchored over the CONUS will
begin to breakdown as the mid-level trough located over the Northern
Rockies shifts eastward. This will result in a more diffuse height
gradient in the West, and thus, a general weakening of the mid-level
flow field. At the surface, high pressure will settle into the Great
Basin region.

...Southwest...
Despite the weakening flow aloft, diurnal heating/mixing should
allow for sustained winds of 10-15 mph to develop in localized
areas. Dry conditions will prevail across the region, with RH values
falling into the teens. For the most part, any fire-weather concerns
will likely be quite localized. However, there exists relative
agreement among mid-range guidance for elevated fire-weather
conditions developing across west-central portions of New Mexico
into far east-central Arizona. Given this relative confidence, an
elevated area has been introduced for this region.

...There is an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
south-central Texas through Tuesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys and the Southern Plains
through Wednesday morning...

...Late-season snowfall is likely across the Northern/Central
Rockies and
High Plains with much colder than average temperatures...

...Warm and dry conditions will cause fire danger in the
southwestern U.S. and California...

A front extending from the southern Mid-Atlantic southwestward to
the Central Gulf Coast, then westward into the Southern Plains
will be quasi-stationary through Wednesday.  The boundary will
move off the Central/Western Gulf Coast into the Gulf of Mexico by
Wednesday evening.  The system will produce severe thunderstorms
and heavy rain over parts of the Southern Plains and the southern
Mid-Atlantic through Tuesday morning.  The SPC has issued an
Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of south-central
Texas a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Ark-La-Tex
and the southern Mid-Atlantic through Tuesday morning.  The
hazards associated with these severe thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  Some of the storms will have a 10% or greater
probability of producing hail two inches or greater over parts of
south-central Texas through Tuesday morning.  The thunderstorms
will also produce heavy rain.  The showers and thunderstorms over
the southern Mid-Atlantic/Southeast will move off the coast
overnight Monday.

The showers and thunderstorms will continue over the Southern
Plains and the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on Tuesday. Due
to the heavy rain over the region, the WPC has issued a Slight
risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Tennessee/Lower
Mississippi Valleys and the Southern Plains through Wednesday
morning.  The hazards associated with the rain are scattered flash
flooding, where urban areas, roads, and small streams are the most
vulnerable. On Tuesday evening and into overnight Tuesday, the
showers and thunderstorms will return to the Southeast and
continue through Wednesday evening. Also, on Wednesday, the
showers and thunderstorms over the Southern Plains will retreat to
the Gulf Coast by Wednesday evening.

Meanwhile, energy from a weakening upper-level low over the Great
Lakes will move over the Northeast.  Rain will develop over parts
of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes
overnight Monday, ending by Tuesday morning.  On Tuesday, the rain
will develop over parts of the Northeast, continuing into
Wednesday evening.  Furthermore, upper-level energy and cold
temperatures will lead to snow across the Northern and Central
Rockies late Tuesday night.  Temperatures are expected to be below
average for much of the country behind the potent cold front,
especially by Tuesday. High temperatures in the central parts of
the High Plains will be around 30 degrees below average for this
time of year.  Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are in effect
for portions of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley and Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley through Tuesday morning in terms of cold low
temperatures. In contrast, temperatures will be warmer than
average over the West Coast, especially California.  The warm
temperatures and dry and windy conditions have led to Elevated and
 Critical Risks of fire weather and Red Flag Warnings in interior
Northern California and the Southwest/Southern Rockies/Southern
High Plains through Tuesday morning.

254 AM EDT Tue May 11 2021

Valid 12Z Fri May 14 2021 - 12Z Tue May 18 2021

...Overview...

The best clustering of guidance shows an evolution toward some
degree of mean troughing over the West while mean ridging
progresses across the central U.S. into the East behind a broad
upper trough that departs from the East Coast this weekend.  There
is a small minority that trends out of phase with this idea by
late in the period though.  As the most likely pattern develops,
expect a gradual increase in coverage and intensity of rainfall
over the central U.S. with time.  Some rain/thunderstorms could
eventually extend into parts of the East while parts of the
Rockies may see some precipitation as well.  Contrasting
temperature anomalies late this week with warmth over the West and
cooler than normal readings to the east of the Rockies should
generally moderate with time, leaving many areas fairly close to
normal by early next week.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Aside from the more open UKMET, 12Z/18Z guidance was showing
decent agreement with forming an upper low over/near California
from the shortwave energy nearing the West Coast as of early
Friday.  The upper low would then eject into the southern Rockies
or High Plains by early next Tuesday.  However there has been a
fairly wide spread for what becomes of separate northern stream
shortwave energy.  New 00Z runs decrease confidence in specifics
with the UKMET holding onto an open trough and the new ECMWF
changing to a more open shortwave as well.  As was seen 24 hours
ago, significant divergences develop for the large scale pattern
by late in the period.  Although the GFS appears to have fixed
some of its prior issues with its western/northern Pacific
forecast, by the latter half of the period it still becomes slower
and more amplified with flow from the eastern Pacific into North
America.  This leads the GFS to show a ridge over the West by
early next week while developing a fairly deep closed low over or
near the Great Lakes.  In contrast most remaining guidance shows
some degree of cyclonic flow arriving into the Northwest U.S.
while above normal heights/ridging prevail over the East.  Latest
GEFS means reflect a compromise, being a little slower than the
ECMWF/CMC and their means with troughing that heads toward the
Northwest while depicting only a shortwave reaching the Great
Lakes and vicinity.  Most D+8 multi-day means have recently been
signaling a trough-ridge pattern, so preference continues to trend
the initial operational model blend more toward the ECMWF/CMC and
the ECMWF mean/GEFS mean by the latter half of the period.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect central U.S. rainfall to focus initially over parts of the
Central Plains and Midwest ahead of a wavy warm front.  With time,
rain and thunderstorms should expand southward and become heavier
as return flow behind eastern U.S. high pressure brings in more
Gulf moisture and western U.S. shortwave energy/possible upper low
approaches the Plains.  Some of the activity over the Midwest
could eventually reach east-southeast into the eastern states as
the focusing warm front extends farther eastward.  There may be
some enhancement of precipitation near the central Rockies/High
Plains late in the period depending on the evolution of the
feature emerging from the West.  In most cases any precipitation
to the west of the Rockies should be fairly light and scattered.
Meanwhile the upper trough moving through the East late this week
into the weekend should promote areas of mostly light rainfall
from the Appalachians into the Northeast.

Well above normal temperatures centered over the Great Basin and
vicinity will extend into Friday with plus 10-20F anomalies for
highs.  Then an upper trough/potential closed low should promote a
cooling trend over the southern half or so of the West, with parts
of the far southwestern U.S. possibly seeing a day or two with
slightly below normal highs.  A trailing upper ridge may promote a
brief rebound over the Interior Northwest on Sunday followed by
cooling trend and southward suppression of remaining above normal
readings as cyclonic flow aloft approaches/arrives.  Note that a
minority scenario could have a stronger ridge persisting over the
West with warmer temperatures.  Over the eastern half of the
country expect below normal temperatures to prevail over many
areas late this week.  Locations near the southeastern coast could
see highs up to 10F or so below normal on Friday.  Then a
moderating trend will likely yield near normal highs and slightly
above normal lows over the eastern half of the lower 48 by early
next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Tue May 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
...Northwest New Mexico...
Moderate to strong mid-level flow across the Four Corners region
will persist through much of the day today. Deep mixing is expected
with temperatures increasing into the 60s to low 70s across northern
Arizona and northwest New Mexico. This deep mixing will bring some
of this stronger flow to the surface amid relative humidity in the
10 to 15 percent range. Therefore, some elevated fire weather
conditions are expected during the afternoon/early evening.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
Weak northerly flow is present in the Sacramento Valley this morning
as an inverted pressure trough is centered across California. These
winds are expected to gradually increase through the day. Valley
parallel mid-level flow will likely mix to the surface which will
help to strengthen the northerly winds. Some sustained winds may
reach 15 mph during the afternoon with relative humidity around 10
to 15 percent.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will build across the western CONUS on Wednesday
with weak to moderate mid-level flow across the Rockies and southern
High Plains. Surface high pressure and a lack of stronger mid-level
flow will likely limit the overall fire weather threat. However,
deep mixing may allow some gusty conditions in portions of New
Mexico with localized elevated conditions. Otherwise, fire weather
conditions should remain benign.

...Widespread rain and thunderstorms will persist across the Gulf
Coast states...

...Ongoing snow in the Central Rockies and Wind River
Mountains/Tetons could continue through the day today...

...Much below normal temperatures should remain across much of the
U.S., with Florida and the West Coast the exceptions...

A meandering frontal boundary is forecast to remain across the
Gulf Coast states and eventually slowly sink southward on
Wednesday into Thursday. Moist inflow from the Gulf of Mexico
interacting with the front should help create additional
widespread showers and thunderstorms in those areas, especially
through tonight. An inch or two of rain, with locally higher
amounts possible, is expected for portions of eastern Texas into
the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southeast. This rainfall and
wet antecedent conditions will lead to the potential for scattered
flash floods in those areas, and a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall as well as a Flash Flood Watch are in place through
tonight. Strong to severe thunderstorms are also a possibility.
Some showers and thunderstorms are possible Wednesday, though are
expected to lessen in coverage later Wednesday into Thursday as
the front gets suppressed.

Upper-level energy and cold temperatures will support continued
snowfall across higher elevations of the Wind River
Mountains/Tetons and the Central Rockies today. Another several
inches of late-season snow are possible especially in central
Colorado. Snow should end by tonight as the supporting upper-level
energy moves east out of the region. However, some light rain
could continue in the Central Plains. Meanwhile in the Northeast,
persistent surface low pressure systems could cause light to
moderate precipitation through Wednesday. Mainly rain is expected,
but higher elevations could see some mix or light snow.

Another couple of days of cooler than normal temperatures are
forecast for the central and eastern U.S. behind the potent cold
front and underneath a cool high pressure system. This morning,
Frost Advisories and Freeze Warnings are once again in effect for
portions of the Great Lakes region, and also stretch into the
Northern/Central Plains and Upper Midwest. High temperatures are
expected to be in the 40s in the Central High Plains, with some
areas 30+ degrees below normal today, and potential for record low
maximum temperatures to be set in the south-central U.S. That
potential for setting records of low maximum temperatures should
spread to the Carolinas on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Florida can
expect warm temperatures south of the front, and the West Coast
will also see building warmth with above normal temperatures over
the next few days. One more day of an Elevated Risk of fire
weather is expected in northern California and New Mexico.

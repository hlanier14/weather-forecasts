Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Mon May 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

No changes to the ongoing forecast. Locally elevated conditions do
appear possible in parts of eastern Montana into western North
Dakota based on current surface observations. Recent large fires in
the area do suggest some risk for fire spread, but rather marginal
temperatures and short duration of stronger winds preclude
highlights.

..Wendt.. 05/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Mon May 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Progressive mid-level flow is expected across the US during the
forecast period, as a Four Corners shortwave trough moves east into
the Plains. Weak ridging along the West Coast will be suppressed as
a second shortwave and jet max move onshore across northern
California this morning. At the surface, low pressure across the
Plains will draw moisture northward, while a cold front moves
southeast out of the Rockies.

...Northern California...
Dry northerly flow is expected to linger through the day across
portions of the Sacramento Valley exacerbating fire weather concerns
through the afternoon. Northerly surface flow around 15-20 mph
should continue down valley through the day, even as upper-level
flow decreases this afternoon. Dry surface conditions with RH around
10-15% are expected as evident in the poor humidity recoveries
currently ongoing early this morning. The overlap of dry and windy
conditions should support widespread elevated to locally critical
fire weather conditions across the Central Valley.

...Southwest Texas...
Ahead of a cold front forecast to move out of the southern Rockies
later this evening, dry and windy conditions will likely develop
from the Rio Grande Valley eastward across the Trans-Pecos region.
Fuels in this area are not particularly supportive of robust fire
weather conditions, given 1-2 inches of QPE over the last several
days. However, with west winds of 20-30 mph and surface RH as low as
15%, some threat for locally elevated fire weather conditions may
develop this afternoon.

100 PM EDT Mon May 03 2021

Valid 12Z Thu May 06 2021 - 12Z Mon May 10 2021

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will be in place across the
nation through Saturday with one closed low crossing the Great
Lakes Thu, northeast Fri, and departing Saturday.
The 06z GFS remains stronger and farther west with the low
offshore from New England Friday night compared to the 06z GEFS
mean, 00z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET, so a more offshore solution is
indicated following the majority cluster.

A closed low over the northeast Pacific is forecast to move east
southeast to near Vancouver Island Friday and onshore into the
northern Rockies Saturday, then Wyoming Sunday morning before
shearing out as it drifts southeast. The 06z GFS was an outlier in
forming a wave on the trough in the northern Plains Sunday and
amplifying it and moving it into the upper MS Valley Monday.  The
06z GEFS mean keeps the wave from amplifying, much like the ECMWF,
Canadian, and their respective ensemble means. Again, the majority
cluster was preferred.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement through
early next week and offer good run to run continuity.  There is
some variance with the timing and strength of smaller scale
systems, but composites of the 06z GEFS Mean, 00z ECMWF Ensemble
Mean, 00z Canadian Ensemble Mean, and operational 00z ECMWF were
used to mitigate these differences.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

On Thursday a 700 mb wave crosses the Great Lakes, producing a
round of showers, moving into the northeast on Friday. On Friday,
more showers are expected with the next wave approaching the
Pacific Northwest, which move into northern Rockies over the
weekend.

On Saturday confluent flow across the Ohio Valley may lead to
showers, then extending into the Mid Atlantic Sunday.  Another
area of enhanced rainfall is becoming more likely across portions
of the middle Mississippi River valley as deep Gulf moisture
intersects a stationary front, with 1-2 inches of rain forecast by
Sunday morning.  The showers continue as the front remains quasi
stationary from the mid MS Valley to the Ohio Valley, with locally
enhanced rain as wave move along the front in the OH Valley. Days
6-7 rainfall forecasts show potential for locally heavy rain near
the confluence of the lower Ohio River Valley and mid MS River
Valley.

A forming closed low over Wyoming Sunday should lead to lower
elevation rain showers over the high Plains and mountain snows,
which should extend down into Colorado Monday 10 May.

Above normal temperatures are likely from the Desert Southwest to
the Great Basin on Thu with temperatures 10-20 degrees above
normal.  This area of above normal temperatures move east from the
Great Basin into the central and southern Rockies on Friday, and
then the southern Plains on Saturday

Early next week, a dipole pattern sets up where temperatures will
fall below normal in the northern Plains (temperatures 10 to 20
degrees below normal), and above normal in the lower MS Valley to
the southeast.

Subject: HAZARDS: Us Hazards Outlook

FXUS21 KWNC 031824
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 03 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast to develop across the West by
early next week, while a subtropical ridge builds over the Southeast. Early in
week-2, a stationary front is expected to extend from the central Great Plains
east to the Ohio Valley. Heavy rain, along this front, is likely to be the
major hazard during week-2. Periods of enhanced onshore flow are forecast to
affect southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of heavy rain for parts of the central and southern Great
Plains,
middle to lower Mississippi Valley, and Ohio Valley, Tue-Thu, May 11-13.

Slight risk of heavy rain for parts of the central and eastern U.S., Tue-Sat,
May 11-15.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest and central to southern
Great Plains, Tue-Wed, May 11-12.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MAY 06 - MONDAY MAY 10:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tsda496MUMO450n9q2dZ69tDPa_vcWAJBkcYiPLXIajASm88JHGp8wjIi3JzEXsVOuwO1jYn$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 11 - MONDAY MAY 17: Ensemble means remain consistent with a
longwave trough developing over the West later in week-1. This 500-hPa trough
is expected to result in surface low development across the central or
southern
high Plains with a subsequent track northeast to the Midwest from May 11 to
13.
Prior to this low pressure system tracking eastward, a stationary front is
forecast to extend from the central Great Plains east to the Mississippi and
Ohio Valleys. This front is likely to be a focus for heavy rainfall (more than
1 inch per 24 hours). Based on good model consistency with the 500-hPa pattern
and the surface along with guidance from the ECMWF ensemble mean, a moderate
risk of heavy rain (more than 1 inch per 24 hours) is posted for parts of the
southern to central Great Plains, lower to middle Mississippi Valley, and
lower
Ohio Valley from May 11 to 13. Within this moderate risk area, the ECMWF
ensemble mean depicts a 40 to 60 percent chance of more than 1 inch and around
a 20 percent chance of more than 2 inches accumulated early in week-2. A
slight
risk of heavy rainfall covers a larger spatial area and extends through May
15.
It should be noted that the GEFS reforecast tool is much less robust with this
signal for heavy rainfall throughout week-2.



Although a flooding possible hazard is not posted at this time, there is an
elevated risk of at least small stream and minor river flooding for the Ozarks
region and middle to lower Mississippi Valley based on: heavy rainfall (1 to 3
inches, locally more) during the next week, saturated soils (above the 70th
percentile) and high 28-day averaged streamflows (generally above the 75th
percentile). As of May 3, none of the River Forecast Centers are designating
any specific areas for significant river flooding during the next five days.



The amplified 500-hPa trough over the West and predicted lee side cyclogenesis
support a slight risk of high winds across the Southwest along with the
central
to southern Great Plains on May 11 and 12. Due to the ongoing severe to
exceptional drought throughout the Southwest, any gusty winds would likely
enhance fire danger and also cause blowing dust.



Above normal temperatures are likely along the Gulf Coast and Florida with
anomalous 500-hPa ridging. Maximum temperatures are forecast to warm into the
lower to middle 90s (degrees F) but heat index values are expected to remain
below hazard thresholds at this time.



A longwave trough over the Bering Sea and multiple low pressure systems favor
near to above normal precipitation throughout Alaska during week-2. However,
precipitation amounts are likely to remain well below hazards thresholds. The
ECMWF ensemble mean depicts around an inch of total precipitation for these
areas during week-2.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CDT Mon May 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Split mid-level flow will persist across the CONUS as shortwave
trough initially above the southern Plains will move eastward into
South through the day. Meanwhile, zonal flow will develop across the
Great Basin and Southwest as ridging becomes better established off
the West Coast. At the surface, high pressure across the central US,
and widespread precipitation across the eastern CONUS, will create
conditions generally unfavorable for widespread fire weather
activity. The only exception will be pockets of locally elevated
fire weather potential across the southern Great Basin, where
relatively warm and dry conditions will coexist with dry fuels. No
areas will be highlighted due to the limited spatial overlap of
favorable fire weather conditions.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 09 - 13 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in good agreement in
regards
to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern. Troughing is predicted
over northeastern North America early in the period, with the mid-level flow
becoming more zonal across the eastern CONUS as the period progresses and the
trough continues to lift out. Increasing amplification is forecast over
western
North America, with ridging favored across the eastern north Pacific,
extending
into eastern Alaska, and troughing forecast over the western half of the
CONUS.
Todays manual 500-hPa height blend depicts below normal heights across much of
the western CONUS, and also extending across the Northern and Central Plains
through the Great Lakes and Northeast. Near to above normal heights are
forecast across remaining areas of the south-central and eastern CONUS. Above
normal heights are depicted across much of Alaska, except over parts of the
Aleutians, where near to below normal heights are favored underneath troughing
forecast over the Bering Sea.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted across
much of the interior western and north-central CONUS underneath predicted
troughing. These enhanced below normal temperature probabilities also extend
across portions of the Great Lakes and Northeast where anomalous northwesterly
mid-level low is predicted on the backside of the troughing forecast across
eastern Canada early in the period. Probabilities for above normal
temperatures
are increased over parts of the Southern Plains, Middle and Lower Mississippi
Valley, Tennessee Valley, Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and Southeast, where
mid-level flow is predicted to be more zonal and weak positive height
anomalies
are favored. Near to above normal temperatures are favored along central and
northern portions of the West Coast of the CONUS due to increased influence
from the East Pacific ridge. Above normal temperatures are favored across much
of Alaska underneath increased ridging and enhanced southerly surface and
mid-level flow ahead of troughing and associated surface low pressure
predicted
over the Bering Sea. The temperature forecast across the CONUS and Alaska is
consistent with both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools.

Troughing forecast across the western and central CONUS during the period
favors increased probabilities of above normal precipitation from the Central
Rockies eastward through much of the central and eastern CONUS, as southerly
flow out of the Gulf of Mexico combined with a east-northeastward orientation
of the mid-level height pattern pomotes intermittent shortwaves ejecting out
of
the trough, bringing enhanced precipitation chances. Ridging and positive
height anomalies along the West Coast of the CONUS favor increased chances for
below normal precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest,
California, the Great Basin, Southwest, and the Southern Rockies. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are also elevated to the north and south of the
mean storm track across the CONUS, specifically over parts of the Northern
Plains, Upper Mississippi Valley, Central Gulf of Mexico Coast, Southern
Georgia, and Florida. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are
increased over most of Alaska due to troughing predicted across the Bering Sea
and an active storm track across the state.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement in the model mid-level height forecast, offset by some
disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 11 - 17 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the week-2 period is similar to
the
6-10 day period but with less amplification. Although the mean mid-level flow
across the CONUS is predicted to be predominately zonal, the ECMWF, GEFS, and
Canadian ensembles continue to depict increased ridging and positive height
anomalies across the eastern Pacific and negative height anomalies over
northeastern North America and the Northwest Atlantic. The persistence of
these
features is the primary focal point for the week-2 temperature and
precipitation outlooks. The manual blend for the period depicts near normal
500-hPa heights across much of the western half of the CONUS, and extending
through the northern tier of the CONUS as the positive height anomaly center
in
the Eastern Pacific teleconnects with intermittent downstream troughing over
the western CONUS. Above normal heights are predicted across portions of the
Lower Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and mid-Atlantic. Near to above normal
heights are forecast across Alaska as a result of ridging forecast over the
East Pacific.

Probabilities for above normal temperatures are increased over the Lower
Mississippi Valley, Southeast, and the Tennessee Valley, colocated with
positive height anomalies. Below normal temperature probabilities are
increased
over parts of the Interior West, Great Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast. This is generally supported by the GEFS
reforecast tool, analog guidance, and teleconnection analysis with the
negative
height anomaly center over the Northwest Atlantic. Enhanced probabilities for
above normal temperatures are highlighted along the West Coast of the CONUS
underneath the influence of ridging in the eastern Pacific. Probabilities for
above normal temperatures also remain elevated across Alaska underneath
perisitient southerly mid-level flow, and consistent with the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools.

The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools are in good agreement in terms of the
week-2 precipitation forecast across the CONUS. Increased chances for above
normal precipitation remain favored for most areas from the Great Plains and
east to the Atlantic Coast, given the similar flow pattern to the 6-10 day
period. Chances for troughing persist across the West and periodic shortwave
disturbances are possible across the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased over much of the western third of
the
CONUS due to the influence from surface high pressure forecast over the East
Pacific. Above normal precipitation chances continue to be increased over much
of Alaska due to troughing over the Bering Sea and the ridging over the
eastern
Pacific favoring a more northward storm track across Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement in the dynamical models in terms of the temperature and
precipitation
forecast, offset by a predicted low amplitude pattern.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...There is an Enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms and a risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Ohio Valley to the Southern
Plains and the Southeast through Wednesday morning...

...Wet snow over parts of the Rockies and Northern Plains...

A slow moving front extending from the Northeast to the Upper
Great Lake to the Southern Plains advances to the East Coast by
Wednesday evening.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop along
and ahead of the front as well in the warm sector over parts of
the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic on Monday evening into Wednesday. The
SPC has issued an Enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms over parts
of the Ohio Valley to the Southern Plains through Tuesday morning.
The hazards associated with the thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few
tornadoes.  A region over southeastern Oklahoma and adjacent parts
of Texas will have a 10% or greater probability of developing
EF2-EF5 tornadoes. A larger area will have a 10% or greater
probability of severe wind gust of 65 knots or greater. About the
same area will have a 10% or greater probability of two-inch
diameter hail or larger through Tuesday morning.  Furthermore, the
SPC has issued a Slight risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic through Tuesday morning.  The main
hazards will be frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gust,
hail, and a few tornadoes.  There is also a risk of excessive rain
fall over parts of the Mid-Atlantic to the Southern Plains. The
heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms may produce isolated
areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid
runoff with heavy rain.

On Tuesday the Enhanced risk of severe thunderstorms moves
eastward to parts of the Tennessee Valley to the Lower Mississippi
Valley.  Simultaneously, there is a Slight risk of excessive
rainfall.  The heavy rain will produce scattered areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams being the
most vulnerable. On Wednesday, the severe threat lessens over
parts of the East Coast and the excessive rainfall risk is
marginal at best.

Meanwhile, an upper-level trough will develop over the Rockies.
The energy will produce wet snow over parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies as rain moves into parts of the Central
Plains overnight Monday.  On

Tuesday morning, the wet snow will wind down over parts of the
Central Rockies as more wet snow and rain develops over the
Northern Rockies. On Wednesday, rain and wet snow will develop
over parts of the Northern Plains, changing over to all rain and
moving into the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley on Wednesday.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will be in place across the
nation through Saturday with one closed low crossing the Great
Lakes Thu, northeast Fri, and departing Saturday.
The 06z GFS remains stronger and farther west with the low
offshore from New England Friday night compared to the 06z GEFS
mean, 00z ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET, so a more offshore solution is
indicated following the majority cluster.

A closed low over the northeast Pacific is forecast to move east
southeast to near Vancouver Island Friday and onshore into the
northern Rockies Saturday, then Wyoming Sunday morning before
shearing out as it drifts southeast. The 06z GFS was an outlier in
forming a wave on the trough in the northern Plains Sunday and
amplifying it and moving it into the upper MS Valley Monday.  The
06z GEFS mean keeps the wave from amplifying, much like the ECMWF,
Canadian, and their respective ensemble means. Again, the majority
cluster was preferred.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement through
early next week and offer good run to run continuity.  There is
some variance with the timing and strength of smaller scale
systems, but composites of the 06z GEFS Mean, 00z ECMWF Ensemble
Mean, 00z Canadian Ensemble Mean, and operational 00z ECMWF were
used to mitigate these differences.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

On Thursday a 700 mb wave crosses the Great Lakes, producing a
round of showers, moving into the northeast on Friday. On Friday,
more showers are expected with the next wave approaching the
Pacific Northwest, which move into northern Rockies over the
weekend.

On Saturday confluent flow across the Ohio Valley may lead to
showers, then extending into the Mid Atlantic Sunday.  Another
area of enhanced rainfall is becoming more likely across portions
of the middle Mississippi River valley as deep Gulf moisture
intersects a stationary front, with 1-2 inches of rain forecast by
Sunday morning.  The showers continue as the front remains quasi
stationary from the mid MS Valley to the Ohio Valley, with locally
enhanced rain as wave move along the front in the OH Valley. Days
6-7 rainfall forecasts show potential for locally heavy rain near
the confluence of the lower Ohio River Valley and mid MS River
Valley.

A forming closed low over Wyoming Sunday should lead to lower
elevation rain showers over the high Plains and mountain snows,
which should extend down into Colorado Monday 10 May.

Above normal temperatures are likely from the Desert Southwest to
the Great Basin on Thu with temperatures 10-20 degrees above
normal.  This area of above normal temperatures move east from the
Great Basin into the central and southern Rockies on Friday, and
then the southern Plains on Saturday

Early next week, a dipole pattern sets up where temperatures will
fall below normal in the northern Plains (temperatures 10 to 20
degrees below normal), and above normal in the lower MS Valley to
the southeast.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0107 AM CDT Tue May 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An active mid-level flow regime with a shortwave trough across the
central US and ridging across the West Coast should persist through
the forecast period. Zonal northwesterly flow is expected across
much of the Great Basin and Southwest. At the surface, dry but
relatively cool and weak downslope winds are expected across the
Southern Rockies and Southwest while high pressure dominates the
Plains. A cold front sweeping across the Midwest will bring cooler
temperatures and widespread precipitation to the eastern Half of the
Country. The result should be limited overlap of favorable
conditions for fire weather across the CONUS through the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0108 AM CDT Tue May 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a broad trough over the Northeast is forecast to
deepen slowly through the day as high pressure along the west Coast
intensifies. The flow regime-will gradually amplify, with northwest
flow aloft expected over the southern Rockies and Southwest. At the
surface, high pressure is forecast to build across the Plains while
low pressure and widespread precipitation cover the east. With high
pressure and widespread precipitation dominating the central and
eastern CONUS respectively, fire weather potential will be
relegated to locally elevated conditions across portions of the
Southwest and southern Rockies.

...Southern Rockies and Southwest...
A belt of stronger mid-level flow associated with a shortwave trough
embedded within the northwesterly zonal regime may bolster low-level
downslope winds through the afternoon. Locally elevated fire weather
potential will be possible across northern New Mexico into the
western Texas Panhandle where the best overlap of 10-15 mph winds
and RH of 15-25% exists. Fuel conditions are somewhat limited, given
recent precipitation across the area. However, enough dry fuel mass
likely exists for marginally elevated fire weather potential.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will initially be in place across
the nation on Friday with well developed troughs near the West
Coast and East Coast, with an upper ridge over the Rockies that
weakens with time as it emerges over the Plains.  As the trough
over the Northeast lifts out, a more quasi-zonal pattern is
expected by the weekend across the central and eastern U.S., with
a second trough building across the West by early next week.  At
the surface, a quasi-stationary frontal boundary with multiple
waves of low pressure along it will be the main weather maker
during the medium range period.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement for the end
of the week, although there is some variance with the timing and
strength of smaller scale systems, but guidance composites tend to
mitigate these differences that is consistent with predictability.
 The GFS is now solidly in line with keeping the developing low
pressure system well offshore the East Coast and taking the storm
out to sea for Friday/Saturday, compared to the nor'easter type
solution portrayed in earlier model runs.  However, the GFS
becomes much faster with ejecting the western U.S. trough over the
Plains during the Monday/Tuesday time period, whereas the
CMC/ECMWF and ensembles are favoring a considerably slower
solution.  The WPC fronts/pressures forecast was based on a
CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend along with some of the ensemble means through
Day 5, and then primarily ECMWF/EC mean/GEFS means by days 6 and 7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Central Plains
to the Ohio Valley where multiple convective complexes are likely
in the vicinity of a slow moving front.  The potential exists for
2 to 4 inches of rain, with locally higher amounts, from eastern
Kansas to western Kentucky.  Some training of thunderstorms may
lead to instances of flooding, and this is something that will
continue to be monitored in the days ahead.  Widespread moderate
to locally heavy rain can also be expected from eastern Colorado
to central Montana as the upper trough/closed low builds in
overhead combined with moist upslope flow.  Dry conditions should
persist across most of the Intermountain West and the Desert
Southwest, as well as the northern Great Lakes.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
western High Plains and adjacent portions of the northern Rockies
for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs up to 20 degrees
below early May averages.  This equates to readings maxing out in
the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those areas, and the higher
elevations of Wyoming, Montana, and northern Colorado can expect
some late season accumulating snow, perhaps exceeding six inches
for some of the higher ranges.  For the Desert Southwest and Great
Basin, the above average readings this week will likely persist
until Friday, after which a return to more seasonable conditions
can be expected.  However, it should remain warm and humid south
of the frontal boundary across the Deep South and Gulf Coast
region with highs up to 10 degrees above normal.

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

An amplified upper level pattern will initially be in place across
the nation on Friday with well developed troughs near the West
Coast and East Coast, with an upper ridge over the Rockies that
weakens with time as it emerges over the Plains.  As the trough
over the Northeast lifts out, a more quasi-zonal pattern is
expected by the weekend across the central and eastern U.S., with
a second trough building across the West by early next week.  At
the surface, a quasi-stationary frontal boundary with multiple
waves of low pressure along it will be the main weather maker
during the medium range period.

Models and ensembles remain in above average agreement for the end
of the week, although there is some variance with the timing and

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding likely across the Deep
South today...

...Unsettled weather to be found throughout much of the eastern
U.S. until a cold front exits the region on Wednesday...

...Dry and unseasonably warm temperatures continue in the West...

The main weather story for today is located across the Deep South,
where severe thunderstorms and flash flooding are likely to cause
impacts. A cold front responsible for the active weather currently
stretches from the Ohio Valley to the Southern Plains. Several
areas of showers and thunderstorms are already found ahead of this
frontal boundary, with new convection expected later today as it
progresses east-southeast. Ample moisture ahead of this cold front
will allow for thunderstorms to strengthen rapidly and produce
downpours capable of dropping several inches of rain. This amount
of rain in a short amount of time can lead to rapid water rises in
low-lying areas. Additionally, some locations across the Deep
South have experienced a wet spring thus far; therefore,
additional rain may magnify flooding concerns. WPC has highlighted
portions of southern Mississippi and southwest Alabama as having a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall/flash flooding. Instances of
flash flooding are also possible farther north and into the
Tennessee Valley. Along with heavy rain, several thunderstorms
traversing the Deep South will have the capability of producing
damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms across the Deep South and lower Tennessee Valley.
Damaging wind gusts are the most likely hazard associated with the
clusters of developing thunderstorms, especially from southern
Mississippi into west-central Alabama.

Areas of scattered showers and thunderstorms will also be found
across much of the eastern United States today as a warm and humid
airmass remains in place. There is an outside chance a few of
these storms could turn severe in the Ohio Valley and
Mid-Atlantic. By Wednesday, the aforementioned cold front will
swing through the East Coast and usher in much cooler and drier
weather, with the only remaining showers lingering across northern
New England Wednesday night.

Throughout western and central sections of the country, a weak
impulse of upper-level energy will cross the Northern Rockies
today before entering the central Plains on Wednesday. Light rain
and mountain snow will accompany the system. Meanwhile, no
precipitation is expected across the West as upper-level ridging
remains situated over the region. High temperatures are forecast
to reach the 80s and 90s (10 to 20 degrees above average for this
time of year) across the Desert Southwest and San
Joaquin/Sacramento valleys today, with even warmer temperatures
expected on Wednesday.

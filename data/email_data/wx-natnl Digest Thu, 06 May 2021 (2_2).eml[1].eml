Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
147 AM EDT Thu May 6 2021

Valid 12Z Sun May 9 2021 - 12Z Thu May 13 2021

***Heavy rain and more storms for portions of the South and the
Ohio Valley***

***Unseasonably cool for the western High Plains with some snow
for the Rockies***

...Weather Pattern and Model Guidance...

A split flow upper level pattern is expected across the U.S. and
southern Canada for the medium range period, with embedded
shortwave impulses in the southern stream providing an active
weather pattern across the south-central U.S. with multiple rounds
of showers and storms.  Farther north, a broad trough over the
Intermountain West and northern Rockies, and a large Canadian
surface high sinking southward across the north-central U.S., will
result in below average temperatures from the Rockies to the East
Coast.  A moderation trend may commence by the middle of next week
across the West as an upper level ridge tries to build back in
after the trough lifts out of the region.

The deterministic model guidance is in decent synoptic scale
agreement for the Sunday-Monday time period, with the exception of
the 12Z CMC across the northwestern U.S. where it is farther north
with the placement of the upper trough, and it is slower with the
progression of the surface low across the Ohio Valley.  By Monday
night, the UKMET becomes stronger than the other guidance with a
shortwave tracking towards the Pacific Northwest, and considerably
slower and stronger with the trough crossing the Great Lakes
region when compared to the ensemble means.  Towards the end of
the forecast period, the GFS/GEFS is slower with the ejection of
the western U.S. trough across the Plains and Midwest, whereas the
ECMWF/ECENS are more progressive, which is normally opposite of
what is typically seen at day 5-7 time scales.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The best rainfall prospects will likely be from the Ohio Valley to
the central Appalachians on Mothers Day, associated with a surface
low tracking eastward across the region.  The potential exists for
1 to 3 inches of rain from southern Indiana to West Virginia.
Another zone of heavy rain, along with strong thunderstorms, is
also probable across portions of the Deep South for next Tuesday
and Wednesday with similar rainfall totals possible.  Some
training of thunderstorms may lead to instances of flooding, and
this is something that will continue to be monitored in the days
ahead.  Light to moderate rain can also be expected for the
western High Plains early next week, and it will be cold enough
for accumulating snow for the higher terrain of Colorado and
Wyoming.  Dry conditions should persist across most of the
Intermountain West and the Desert Southwest.

Temperatures will likely be more reminiscent of March across the
central and western High Plains, and adjacent portions of the
northern Rockies for the Sunday to Tuesday time period, with highs
up to 20 degrees below early May averages.  This equates to
readings maxing out in the mid 40s to mid 50s for many of those
areas, and even colder across the central and northern Rockies.
Some of these cooler temperatures should also be realized across
Great Lakes and Northeast U.S. courtesy of the upper trough and
Canadian surface high in place, although not as anomalous.  By the
middle of next week, above normal temperatures are likely to make
a return to the West Coast region ahead of the next cold front.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Thu May 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
Across the CONUS, broad troughing will continue in the Northeast as
the mid-level flow pattern gradually becomes more amplified. A ridge
of high pressure over the Rockies will intensify, while a shortwave
trough is forecast to move onshore across California. At the
surface, a cold front will push east through the western Great Basin
while high pressure becomes established over the central Plains.

...Red River Valley/Northern Plains...
A belt of strong mid-level flow is expected to develop over the
region on the backside of the broad trough across the northeastern
US. A weak front will move south out of Canada through the day,
bringing dry and breezy conditions to the northern Plains and upper
Midwest. North winds of 10-20 mph and surface humidity of 20-30%
will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Great Basin and Southwest...
Ahead of the shortwave trough and cold front across the western
Great Basin, gusty southerly winds are expected to increase early in
the day. Warm temperatures in the 70s to 80s F will support deep
mixing and low surface humidity of 10-15%. Locally elevated fire
weather conditions appear possible given the favorable
meteorological overlap. However, the lack of robust fuels cast doubt
on how widespread favorable fire weather conditions may become.

Mid-level moisture ahead of the cold front will also support
isolated showers/thunderstorms from the Great Basin southeastward
into the portions of the Southwest. Dry surface conditions will
limit any precipitation from storms that do develop during the day
supporting low-end dry thunderstorm potential.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0150 AM CDT Thu May 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, meridional flow will become more amplified
through the period as the shortwave ridging over the central US
shifts to the east. At the surface, high pressure will strengthen
over the Midwest and northern Plains while a cold front, associated
with a western US trough, moves eastward toward the Rockies.
Elevated fire weather conditions are likely ahead of this front
across the Southwest.

...Western New Mexico, eastern Arizona, and the Four Corners....
As stronger mid-level southwesterlies overspread the region ahead of
the shortwave trough, low-level flow is forecast to increase
markedly. Deep vertical mixing and momentum transport will bolster
low-level winds to 15-25 mph by the afternoon. Warm temperatures and
humidity as low as 8-10% overlapping with the strong winds will be
supportive of widespread elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions from New Mexico toward the Western Slope.

To the east of the elevated area across the higher terrain of
central New Mexico, isolated thunderstorms are forecast to
developing during the day. Model soundings indicate PWATS between
0.45 and 0.75 inches, as well as mostly dry low-level profiles. A
few cloud to ground lightning strikes appear possible with some
potential for starts and holdovers despite wetter than average fuel
conditions.

...Unsettled weather enters the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Great Basin today before shifting into the Northern High Plains on
Friday...

...Scattered showers and thunderstorms found across the Lower
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic through the beginning
of the weekend...

...Warm temperatures in the West spread into the Rockies and High
Plains on Friday as cooler temperatures remain throughout the
East...

A relative lull in the recent active weather pattern is forecast
to the end the workweek. For the eastern half of the country, a
lingering cold front across Florida will produce scattered showers
and thunderstorms until exiting the region on Friday morning. A
few storms could turn severe along eastern sections of the
peninsula today. A separate system swinging through the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys this afternoon is expected to spark
thunderstorms of its own, with low chances for damaging wind gusts
and large hail. By Friday, this same low pressure system and
associated cold front will reach the Mid-Atlantic, bringing
additional rain and isolated thunderstorms. Behind the cold front,
cool and below average temperatures will be found throughout much
of the eastern U.S. over the next couple of days. Highs will only
reach the 50s and 60s across the Great Lakes, Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. This equates to temperatures around
10 to 20 degrees below average.

In the West, a cold front off the coast of the Pacific Northwest
will push inland this afternoon and evening through the Northwest
and Northern Great Basin. Light rain and higher elevation snow, as
well as scattered thunderstorms can be expected. Precipitation is
then forecast to reach the Northern Rockies and Northern High
Plains by Friday while an upper-level low drops southeastward into
the region. As colder air aloft filters into the Northern Rockies,
snow could potentially mix into the lower elevations of western
Montana on Friday night.

While much of the Southwest and Central Great Basin dealing with
exceptional drought could use rain, little to no precipitation is
anticipated across this area with the approaching storm system.
Temperatures are also expected to remain well above average and
top out near the triple digits in the typical southwestern hot
spots. Above average temperatures will also be felt throughout
much of the central and southern Rockies/High Plains as well.

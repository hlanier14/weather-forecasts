Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0936 AM CDT Mon May 02 2022

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL TO SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on recent rainfall reports, morning surface
observations, and trends in the latest hi-res guidance. Fire weather
concerns remain most likely across central to southern NM this
afternoon where RH values are already near or below 15% and westerly
winds are increase to 15-20 mph. To the east across the TX
Panhandle, MRMS rainfall estimates show several swaths of 0.10+
inches of rainfall from last night's thunderstorms. While critical
conditions are possible across much of the TX Panhandle (including
along and north of the I-40 corridor and possibly into northwest
OK), the Elevated risk area is limited to the local rainfall
minimums where fuels are likely still receptive. A cold front is
noted across eastern CO/western KS in morning surface observations,
and will likely reach the I-40 corridor with gusty northerly winds
by around 00 UTC.

..Moore.. 05/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Mon May 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough will move into the southern Plains today. Farther
west, another shortwave trough will move into the Great Basin. At
the surface, a cyclone will deepen in the Texas Panhandle before
moving northeastward through the day. A cold front will eventually
move southward into the High Plains region.

...New Mexico...
Despite weaker mid-level winds, critical fire weather is possible
during the afternoon due to the strong surface pressure gradient.
Westerly winds will reach 20+ mph in some parts of central and
southern New Mexico. The airmass will remain quite dry and RH will
fall to 10-15%.

...Texas Panhandle into the Permian Basin...
Critical meteorological conditions are possible in the Panhandle and
South Plains. However, scattered thunderstorms on Sunday evening
have produced rainfall across the region, particularly in the
Panhandle. Highlights have been adjusted to account for
rain-impacted fuels. Localized fire weather concerns are still
possible in those areas, however.

...Southern Nevada...
With the approaching trough, southerly/southwesterly winds will
increase ahead of a Pacific boundary. Fuels that have become
critically dry will promote large fire potential. Winds of 15-20 mph
will be common, but isolated higher speeds are possible. RH should
generally range from 15-20% during the afternoon.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO...

The ongoing forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
needed based on trends in latest guidance. The Elevated risk area is
expanded westward to include portions of the lower Colorado river
valley where recent fuel analyses indicate fuels are critically dry
and 15-20 mph winds with 10-20% RH are expected during the morning
hours. These winds will likely diminish through peak heating as the
stronger surface pressure gradient shifts east, but confidence in at
least a few hours of elevated conditions is high enough to warrant
the expansion. See the previous discussion below for additional
details.

...Synopsis...
In the wake of Monday's shortwave trough, another trough will move
into the central Rockies/Four Corners region on Tuesday. A lee
trough will deepen during the day in eastern New Mexico.

...Southwest and Southern High Plains...
Stronger mid-level winds are expected on Tuesday. Coupled with
another deepening lee trough, Critical fire weather should also be
more widespread than on Monday. Humidity will range from 10-20%
during the afternoon. Winds are expected to reach 20-25 mph in
northwest Arizona into central and eastern New Mexico with other
areas seeing 15-20 mph.

...Severe weather and enhanced rainfall threat with southern
stream closed low track Thursday into Saturday...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday-next Monday...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking into the Plains and eastward, with the GFS/GEFS mean
still on the fast side compared to the better clustered and slower
recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean solutions. The
WPC forecast continues to lean towards the slower side of the
forecast envelope, given continuity, but also the general nature
of a separated southern stream flow with an embedded closed
system. Latest 12 UTC models and ensembles continue to trend in
this general direction, but the GFS is slightly slower with its
low than previous runs. A non-GFS consensus also seems to work
well for the rest of the country and maintains good WPC product
continuity, though with more emphasis on the ECMWF ensemble mean
and NAEFS mean into day 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. Out
West, there remains a general theme of leading main upper
troughing reaching the coast Thursday, with a growing signal and
guidance starting to converge on the depiction of a more digging
system over the weekend into early next week as part of a
developing Omega style block over the lower 48 to also include
downstream development of an amplified and warming east-central
U.S. upper ridge and stormy western Atlantic closed low/trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains to the
Mississppi Valley/Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.
The Storm Prediction Center shows a threat for severe weather
Thursday into Friday across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Strong storms are also possible into the weekend with
slow/steady downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence,
ample moisture inflow, and instability will also offer a threat
for enhanced comma head and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall
focus from the mid-lower Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.

The digging of a moderately amplified/dynamic upper trough and
frontal system energies across the West Coast and subsequent
inland progress Thursday through the weekend will bring a
widespread precipitation focus from the Northwest through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and height falls/cooling will
favor a threat for heavy terrain focusing snows. Upper
dynamics/frontal translation should also support an emerging
convection/rainfall pattern with local runoff concerns across the
north-central U.S. by later weekend/early next week.

Above normal temperatures progress from the West on Thursday into
the central/midwest states thereafter as the pattern begins to
amplify and a strong ridge sets up in between a trough/closed low
over the west, and a broad closed low across the western Atlantic.
These troughs will support temperatures as much as 10-15 degrees
below normal across a large portion of the West and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 02 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 08 - 12 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in predicting an amplified
500-hPa height pattern across much of North America early in the period. A
strong, anomalous trough is forecast over the western CONUS on day 6, with
anomalous downstream ridging predicted over eastern Canada. A trough is
forecast farther to the east, off the east coast of the CONUS, which would
promote anomalous onshore flow across much of the Mid-Atlantic region. As t=
he
period progresses, model solutions begin to diverge as the ECMWF/Canadian
ensemble means persist the trough over the western CONUS throughout most of
the
period while the GEFS is much more progressive in moving the trough eastwar=
d
across the central CONUS with time. Regardless of differences in
progressiveness, models generally agree in weakening the trough towards the
end
of the 6-10 day period. In response to the trough in the West, the
ECMWF/Canadian solutions maintain strong ridging in eastern Canada througho=
ut
the period while the GEFS is generally weaker with this feature. Farther to
the
north, models are in good agreement in maintaining mean troughing over most=
 of
Mainland Alaska, ahead of a strong ridge forecast over the Aleutians.

Predicted strong troughing (particularly early in the period), leads to
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures across most of the west=
ern
CONUS.  Increased southerly flow ahead of this trough favors enhanced
probabilities of above normal temperatures across much of the Southern Plai=
ns
and east-central CONUS. Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for
much
of the Mid-Atlantic coast, due to the potential for a prolonged period of
anomalous onshore flow. Below normal temperature probabilities are enhanced
for
most of central and southern Mainland Alaska as well as the Panhandle, due =
to
mean troughing forecast across much of the state.

An active pattern is favored for most of the central CONUS, due to the
likelihood of anomalous southerly flow and associated moisture advection ah=
ead
of the deep trough predicted over the western CONUS. Therefore, probabiliti=
es
of above normal precipitation are enhanced for most of the Plains, Upper an=
d
Middle Mississippi Valley, and parts of the Central and Northern Rockies. A
drying trend is favored behind the mean trough axis in the West, leading to
slightly elevated chances of near to below normal precipitation along the W=
est
Coast. Ridging over eastern North America leads to elevated chances of belo=
w
normal precipitation for most of the eastern third of the CONUS. However, t=
he
potential for enhanced onshore flow results in reduced probabilities for be=
low
normal precipitation for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast. Near to
above
normal precipitation is favored for Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle due t=
o
mean troughing. Conversely, near to below normal precipitation is most like=
ly
for much of the Aleutians due to predicted ridging.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, a=
nd
30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement on an amplified pattern early in the period offset by
significantly increased model divergence later in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 10 - 16 2022

During week-2, the overall 500-hPa flow is forecast to transition to a less
amplified pattern across much of North America. Residual anomalous troughin=
g
over the western CONUS is forecast to transition to a more zonal pattern wi=
th
time as heights begin to rise along the West Coast. In response, ridging ov=
er
eastern North America early in the period is forecast to significantly weak=
en
by the end of week 2. Mean troughing is forecast to persist over Mainland
Alaska throughout the period but with only modest height anomalies. More
significant height anomalies are predicted across the Aleutians as above
normal
heights are forecast in association with mean ridging.

Below normal temperatures are favored for the west-central CONUS due to
residual troughing forecast early in the period. Probabilities of above nor=
mal
temperatures are elevated for most of the eastern third of the CONUS as wel=
l
as
much of the Southern Plains, particularly early in the period. Persistent
enhanced onshore flow reduces probabilities of above normal temperatures fo=
r
parts of the Mid-Atlantic region. Near to above normal temperatures are
favored
along the West Coast as heights are forecast to rise later in the period.
Persistent troughing leads to elevated chances of near to below normal
temperatures across Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle.

Chances of above normal precipitation are elevated for most of the Plains a=
nd
parts of the Mississippi Valley, particularly early in the period, ahead of=
 a
trough forecast over the western CONUS. Conversely, below normal precipitat=
ion
is most likely for most of the West, as heights are generally forecast to r=
ise
as the period progresses. Below normal precipitation is favored for much of
the
Northeast, in association with anomalous ridging predicted over eastern Can=
ada
early in the period. Conversely, there is a slight tilt toward above normal
precipitation for parts of the Florida Peninsula due to weakly anomalous me=
an
troughing predicted in the vicinity. Above normal precipitation is also
favored
for most of Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, as troughing is forecast to
persist ahead of mean ridging forecast over the Aleutians.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 40=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted transition to a lower amplitude pattern as the period progresse=
s.

FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 02 2022

SYNOPSIS: The models are in fair agreement on the average mid-level pattern
during week-2, but there are significant differences in the timing and
magnitude of individual systems. But all models generally agree that a
mid-level trough and associated surface low pressure system will track
eastward
through the central CONUS and weaken during the first half of week-2, and
today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs temperature, precipitation, and wind haza=
rds are all related to this
system. In its wake, week-2 will start with anomalously cold air settled ov=
er
much of the interior West from the Rockies into the West Coast States.
Subfreezing temperatures may occur well southward into the southern Rockies=
,
and as far eastward as the central High Plains. Although the tools are not =
in
good agreement on the evolution of this system, most lean toward a slower,
more
amplified solution, which would bring a slight risk of heavy precipitation =
and
high winds to parts of the central CONUS. From the middle of week-2 onward,
all
models indicate a de-amplifying mid-level pattern, reducing chances for
additional hazards. Flooding - primarily associated with snowmelt - may
continue to impact parts of the Red River Valley of the North, the James Ri=
ver
Valley, and parts of central and eastern Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across most of the Rockies,
Intermountain West, and Great Basin, Tue-Wed, May 10-11

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the eastern and south-centr=
al
Great Plains, Tue-Wed, May 10-11

Slight risk of high winds over much of the Great Plains, Tue-Wed, May 10-11

Possible flooding along the Red River of the North and part of the James Ri=
ver

Possible flooding in central and eastern Alaska

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MAY 05 - MONDAY MAY 09:

5JMOuFfMzh1-jxyr1gBj61Vn0yx47Y$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 10 - MONDAY MAY 16: The models are in poor agreement on the
evolution of the weather pattern during week-2, but all start week-2 with a
mid-level trough somewhere over or near the western CONUS, which spawns a
surface storm system that weakens as the mid-level trough flattens and push=
es
off to the northeast. The GEFS is the most progressive of the ensembles, wi=
th
the trough already near the central CONUS at the start of week-2. The Europ=
ean
and Canadian ensembles are more amplified and move systems to the east more
slowly. The slower, more-amplified solution is favored, but confidence is n=
ot
high and the GEFS solution cannot be ruled out, and even the favored Europe=
an
and Canadian ensembles aren=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt in great agreement =
on the details of the storm
evolution.



Because of the general agreement that some sort of storm will be affecting =
the
central CONUS, there is an increased likelihood that heavy precipitation an=
d
high winds will affect parts of the central states early in the period. Aft=
er
day 2 (Wed. May 11), all models show a deamplifying pattern that will weake=
n
the storm system as it pushes off to the northeast, ending the hazards thre=
at.
Most models show a de-amplifying, more-progressive pattern evolving as week=
-2
progresses, lowering the chances for storminess and hazards. In the wake of
the
system, below-normal temperatures will already be in place over much of the
western states, leading to a hazard for much below normal temperatures ther=
e
early week-2. The more-amplified European ensembles have colder air remaini=
ng
over the region longer relative to the GEFS, but both show at least somewha=
t
below-normal temperatures over the western half of the CONUS as week-2 star=
ts.
The cold air mass moves eastward and modifies during the middle and end of
week-2, consistent with a progresssive and de-amplifying pattern.



To the east of the evolving storm system in the central states, week-2 shou=
ld
start with an amplified mid-level ridge over eastern North America, with th=
e
largest positive 500-hPa height anomalies centered in southeastern Canada
according to the European and Canadian ensembles. This would bring much war=
mer
than normal weather into the Great Lakes Region and Northeast early week-2.
The
GEFS is significantly weaker and more progressive than the Canadian and
European ensembles, keeping significant warmth out of the eastern CONUS. Th=
e
more amplified solution is preferred. But while week-2 will start out much
warmer than normal in the Northeast and Great Lakes Region, temperatures
won=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt
be hot enough to rise to the level of a hazard. None of the ensemble
re-forecast tools show temperatures reaching 90 deg. F, and highs marginall=
y
above 85 deg. F should only reach as far north as the Great Lakes Region, a=
nd
only on day one (Tue May 10).



Around the middle of week-2, with a low-amplitude ridge at both the surface
and
mid-levels should bring much above normal temperatures into the California
Valleys. Right now, highs look to potentially top 95 deg. F on one or two d=
ays
according to the re-forecast tools for both the European ensembles and the
GEFS, but this is somewhat below the threshold for temperature hazards ther=
e
in
early May; however, this area will be monitored for indications that
temperatures may reach higher, and meet the hazards criteria.



Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Red River Valley of the North=
,
and extend into part of the James River basin, primarily due to melting sno=
w
and ice. Flooding is also possible through week-2 in parts of central and
eastern Alaska for the same reason.

...Heavy Rains, Flash Flooding and Severe Weather will threaten
the Southern Plains Monday night/early Tuesday and again on
Wednesday...

...An Elevated to Critical Fire Weather Threat to continue across
the Southern High Plains...

...Heavy Precipitation possible from the Mid to Upper Mississippi
Valley into the Lower Great Lakes...

...Much below average temperatures expected for the Central
Plains, while above average temperatures stretch from the Southern
Plains, across the Gulf Coast and into the Mid Atlantic and
develop over California into portions of the Pacific Northwest...

The recent active weather pattern that has seen a series of
systems push off the eastern Pacific and move downstream across
the Lower 48 will continue into the middle part of this week.  The
lead system pushing out into the Central to Southern Plains today
will produce potential of heavy rains, flash flooding and severe
weather Monday night into the early morning hour of Tuesday across
much of Oklahoma, northwest Arkansas, southwest Missouri and
southeast Kansas.  This will be followed by another system pushing
inland today across the Pacific Northwest, through the Great Basin
and Rockies on Tuesday and into the Central to Southern High
Plains on Wednesday.  Additional heavy rains, flash flooding and
severe weather are again possible Wednesday across portions of the
Southern Plains that are expected to receive these threats Monday
night into early Tuesday.  As this second system moves from the
Pacific Northwest through the Northern Rockies, heavy snows are
possible from the Cascades of Oregon into the Northern Rockies of
south Central Idaho and northwest Wyoming

To the south of the area of expected active thunderstorms over the
next few days, high winds and continued dry conditions will keep
the fire weather threat going across portions of the Southern High
Plains from Western and Southwest Texas, across much of New
Mexico, southeast Colorado into northern and eastern Arizona.
These regions have had little if any precipitation over the past
month and remain in extreme to exceptional drought as per the
latest Drought Monitor.

The aforementioned lead system bringing active weather Monday
night into early Tuesday over the Southern Plains will continue to
push east northeast through the Lower to Middle Mississippi Valley
and Ohio Valley on Tuesday and into the Northeast on Wednesday.
Heavy rains are possible from the Upper Mississippi Valley into
the Lower Great Lakes with this system, along with a threat severe
weather across the Ohio Valley.

The current much below average temperatures across portions of the
Central Plains on Monday will persist into mid week with high
temperatures 15 to 20 degrees below average.  This below average
temperature air will also be pushing eastward on Tuesday and
Wednesday across the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and
Northeast.  The below average temperature anomalies across these
regions, however, will not be as great as over the Central Plains
with high temperatures approximately 6 to 12 degrees below
average.  Above average temperatures expected Tuesday and
Wednesday from the Southern Plains, across the South and into the
Mid-Atlantic.  Much above average temperatures expected to build
across California into the Pacific Northwest on Wednesday.

...Severe weather and enhanced rainfall threat with southern
stream closed low track Thursday into Saturday...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday-next Monday...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking into the Plains and eastward, with the GFS/GEFS mean
still on the fast side compared to the better clustered and slower
recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean solutions. The
WPC forecast continues to lean towards the slower side of the
forecast envelope, given continuity, but also the general nature
of a separated southern stream flow with an embedded closed
system. Latest 12 UTC models and ensembles continue to trend in
this general direction, but the GFS is slightly slower with its
low than previous runs. A non-GFS consensus also seems to work
well for the rest of the country and maintains good WPC product
continuity, though with more emphasis on the ECMWF ensemble mean
and NAEFS mean into day 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. Out
West, there remains a general theme of leading main upper
troughing reaching the coast Thursday, with a growing signal and
guidance starting to converge on the depiction of a more digging
system over the weekend into early next week as part of a
developing Omega style block over the lower 48 to also include
downstream development of an amplified and warming east-central
U.S. upper ridge and stormy western Atlantic closed low/trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains to the
Mississppi Valley/Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.
The Storm Prediction Center shows a threat for severe weather
Thursday into Friday across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Strong storms are also possible into the weekend with
slow/steady downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence,
ample moisture inflow, and instability will also offer a threat
for enhanced comma head and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall
focus from the mid-lower Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.

The digging of a moderately amplified/dynamic upper trough and
frontal system energies across the West Coast and subsequent
inland progress Thursday through the weekend will bring a
widespread precipitation focus from the Northwest through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and height falls/cooling will
favor a threat for heavy terrain focusing snows. Upper
dynamics/frontal translation should also support an emerging
convection/rainfall pattern with local runoff concerns across the
north-central U.S. by later weekend/early next week.

Above normal temperatures progress from the West on Thursday into
the central/midwest states thereafter as the pattern begins to
amplify and a strong ridge sets up in between a trough/closed low
over the west, and a broad closed low across the western Atlantic.
These troughs will support temperatures as much as 10-15 degrees
below normal across a large portion of the West and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.

...Severe weather and enhanced rainfall threat with southern
stream closed low track Thursday into Saturday...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday-next Monday...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking into the Plains and eastward, with the GFS/GEFS mean
still on the fast side compared to the better clustered and slower
recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF ensemble mean solutions. The
WPC forecast continues to lean towards the slower side of the
forecast envelope, given continuity, but also the general nature
of a separated southern stream flow with an embedded closed
system. Latest 12 UTC models and ensembles continue to trend in
this general direction, but the GFS is slightly slower with its
low than previous runs. A non-GFS consensus also seems to work
well for the rest of the country and maintains good WPC product
continuity, though with more emphasis on the ECMWF ensemble mean
and NAEFS mean into day 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. Out
West, there remains a general theme of leading main upper
troughing reaching the coast Thursday, with a growing signal and
guidance starting to converge on the depiction of a more digging
system over the weekend into early next week as part of a
developing Omega style block over the lower 48 to also include
downstream development of an amplified and warming east-central
U.S. upper ridge and stormy western Atlantic closed low/trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains to the
Mississppi Valley/Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.
The Storm Prediction Center shows a threat for severe weather
Thursday into Friday across portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley. Strong storms are also possible into the weekend with
slow/steady downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence,
ample moisture inflow, and instability will also offer a threat
for enhanced comma head and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall
focus from the mid-lower Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic Thursday-Saturday.

The digging of a moderately amplified/dynamic upper trough and
frontal system energies across the West Coast and subsequent
inland progress Thursday through the weekend will bring a
widespread precipitation focus from the Northwest through the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies and height falls/cooling will
favor a threat for heavy terrain focusing snows. Upper
dynamics/frontal translation should also support an emerging
convection/rainfall pattern with local runoff concerns across the
north-central U.S. by later weekend/early next week.

Above normal temperatures progress from the West on Thursday into
the central/midwest states thereafter as the pattern begins to
amplify and a strong ridge sets up in between a trough/closed low
over the west, and a broad closed low across the western Atlantic.
These troughs will support temperatures as much as 10-15 degrees
below normal across a large portion of the West and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1246 AM CDT Tue May 03 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
Another shortwave trough within the Great Basin will move into the
central Rockies today. A deep surface low will develop in eastern
Colorado and slowly shift into eastern New Mexico through the day.
Mid-level winds will strengthen as the trough approaches and the
strong surface pressure gradient will drive westerly/southwesterly
winds across much of Arizona and New Mexico. A Pacific front will
move through the Great Basin and into Arizona.

...Southwest...
Critical fire weather is expected during the afternoon. Surface
winds will reach 20-25 mph from northwest Arizona into western and
central New Mexico. Some higher speeds are possible locally. Dry air
will remain across the region. As the trough moves in, some
higher-level moisture may be brought northward. This will mean an
increase in high-level clouds which could impact afternoon RH. Even
with some cloud cover potential, values of 10-15% are still
expected. Elevated conditions are expected within southeast Arizona
and eastern New Mexico where winds will be 15-20 mph with 15-20% RH.

...Southern Nevada...
Strong northerly winds behind the cold front will develop relatively
early in the day. The post-front airmass will remain dry and
humidity could fall to near 20% early and to near 10% later in the
day. The strongest winds (20 mph) are expected earlier in the day
and may not overlap much with critically low RH. Elevated fire
weather is expected.

...Enhanced rainfall threat with closed low track into
Friday/Saturday from the Ohio Valley to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday into next week...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking from the central to eastern U.S. this period, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the better
clustered and slower recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean solutions. The WPC forecast continues to lean
towards the slower side of the forecast envelope, given
continuity, but also the general nature of a separated southern
stream flow with an embedded closed system. The 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean seemed to offer a decent representation of the
slower guidance cluster, but the latest 00 UTC ECMWF offers new
uncertainty with a more northward track trend.

This less progressive 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean consensus
seemed to work well for the rest of the country and maintains good
WPC product continuity, though with more emphasis on the ECMWF
ensemble mean into day 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. There
remains a general theme of leading main upper troughing reaching
the coast Thursday, with a growing signal to develop and reinforce
an amplified mean upper trough over the West Friday into early
next week as part of a developing Omega style block over the lower
48 to also include downstream development of an amplified and
warming east-central U.S. upper ridge and stormy western Atlantic
closed low/trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains/lower
Mississippi Valley Friday to the Ohio Valley then
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic over the weekend. The Storm Prediction
Center shows a threat for severe weather into Friday across
portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys. Strong
storms are also possible into the weekend with slow/steady
downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence, ample moisture
inflow, and instability will also offer a threat for enhanced
comma head and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall focus from the
mid-lower Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West this period as an amplified
mean upper trough and wavy/well defined frontal systems become
established over the region Friday into next week. This will
support significant cooling and bring a widespread precipitation
focus from the Northwest through the north-central Great
Basin/Rockies to include a substantial and lingering threat for
heavy terrain focusing snows. These troughs will support
temperatures as much as 10-20 degrees below normal across a large
portion of the West. Upper dynamics and slow wavy frontal
translation should also support an emerging convection/rainfall
pattern with local runoff concerns across the north-central U.S.
by later weekend/early next week, albeit with less certain system
details at these longer time frames. This could lead to runoff
issues as the region has experienced quite a bit of rain in April.

Extended Forecast Discussion

...Enhanced rainfall threat with closed low track into
Friday/Saturday from the Ohio Valley to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...
...Heavy snow threat from the Northwest to the North-Central Great
Basin/Rockies Friday into next week...
...Active pattern set to transition to Omega-style blocky pattern
by early next week...


...Pattern Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Guidance remains varied with the progression of a closed upper low
tracking from the central to eastern U.S. this period, with the
GFS/GEFS mean still on the fast side compared to the better
clustered and slower recent ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF
ensemble mean solutions. The WPC forecast continues to lean
towards the slower side of the forecast envelope, given
continuity, but also the general nature of a separated southern
stream flow with an embedded closed system. The 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean seemed to offer a decent representation of the
slower guidance cluster, but the latest 00 UTC ECMWF offers new
uncertainty with a more northward track trend.

This less progressive 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean consensus
seemed to work well for the rest of the country and maintains good
WPC product continuity, though with more emphasis on the ECMWF
ensemble mean into day 6/7 amid growing forecast spread. There
remains a general theme of leading main upper troughing reaching
the coast Thursday, with a growing signal to develop and reinforce
an amplified mean upper trough over the West Friday into early
next week as part of a developing Omega style block over the lower
48 to also include downstream development of an amplified and
warming east-central U.S. upper ridge and stormy western Atlantic
closed low/trough.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

A closed upper trough and well organized surface low/frontal
system is expected to track from the south-central Plains/lower
Mississippi Valley Friday to the Ohio Valley then
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic over the weekend. The Storm Prediction
Center shows a threat for severe weather into Friday across
portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee valleys. Strong
storms are also possible into the weekend with slow/steady
downstream track of the system. Upper diffluence, ample moisture
inflow, and instability will also offer a threat for enhanced
comma head and wavy lead/trailing frontal rainfall focus from the
mid-lower Mississippi and Ohio valleys to the
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic.

Robust digging of a series of dynamic upper systems will lead to a
dramactic change over much of the West this period as an amplified
mean upper trough and wavy/well defined frontal systems become
established over the region Friday into next week. This will
support significant cooling and bring a widespread precipitation
focus from the Northwest through the north-central Great
Basin/Rockies to include a substantial and lingering threat for
heavy terrain focusing snows. These troughs will support
temperatures as much as 10-20 degrees below normal across a large
portion of the West. Upper dynamics and slow wavy frontal
translation should also support an emerging convection/rainfall
pattern with local runoff concerns across the north-central U.S.
by later weekend/early next week, albeit with less certain system
details at these longer time frames. This could lead to runoff
issues as the region has experienced quite a bit of rain in April.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Tue May 03 2022

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The shortwave trough over the Rockies will eventually eject into the
central Plains on Wednesday. Stronger mid-level flow will exist more
broadly across the Southwest. At the surface, a cyclone will deepen
in eastern New Mexico and drive downslope flow across the state.

...New Mexico...
Fire weather concerns will be focused across southern, central and
eastern portions of the state. As compared to Tuesday, mid-level
winds will be stronger over a broader area, particularly in the
south. Surface winds will also be more westerly and favor drier
conditions. Afternoon RH is expected to fall to 5-15%. Winds of
20-25 mph are also expected. Some of the higher elevation areas in
the Critical highlights may only see Elevated conditions due to
slightly higher RH values.

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms for portions of
the Ohio Valley/Central Appalachians through Wednesday morning...

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on
Wednesday...

...There is a Critical Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southern Rockies/Southwest...

On Tuesday, low pressure roughly over the Middle Mississippi
Valley will move eastward to the Lower Great Lakes by Wednesday
morning, then move off the New England Coast by Wednesday evening.
The system will draw moisture northward into the Ohio Valley, and
the associated boundary will aid in destabilizing the atmosphere
producing showers and thunderstorms from the Ohio Valley to the
Southern Plains. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Ohio Valley/Central
Appalachians through Wednesday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, moderate to heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms that will be going over areas sensitive to excessive
rainfall. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley
into the Central Appalachians through Wednesday morning. The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain. Furthermore, late Tuesday afternoon, showers and
thunderstorms will move into the Mid-Atlantic, with some of the
thunderstorms becoming severe. On Wednesday, showers and
thunderstorms will slowly move eastward from Southern New England,
the Mid-Atlantic, and the Southeast to off the coast through
overnight Wednesday. Rain will also develop over parts of the
Eastern Ohio Valley to the Northeast that will move off the East
Coast overnight Wednesday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, a front will move from the Northern
Rockies/Great Basin to the Southern Plains by Wednesday. The
system will produce rain and highest elevation snow over parts of
the Northern Intermountain Region/Great Basin. Overnight Tuesday,
more snow than rain, with a few embedded thunderstorms, will move
into the Northern Rockies/Central Rockies and rain over parts of
the Central High Plains by Wednesday morning.

As the associated energy moves out of the Rockies into the Plains,
moisture will once again be drawn over the Southern/Central Plains
late Tuesday into Wednesday. As a result, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Southern Plains
overnight Tuesday. On Wednesday, the associated boundary will aid
in destabilizing the atmosphere producing showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains. Therefore, the
SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over the
Southern Plains from Wednesday through Thursday morning. The
hazards associated with these thunderstorms are frequent
lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few
tornadoes. In addition, there is an increased risk for EF2 to EF5
tornadoes and large hail, two inches or greater, over parts of the
area.

In addition, heavy rain will be associated with these
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over parts of
Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley
through Thursday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams being the most vulnerable.

Furthermore, the SPC issued a Critical Risk of fire weather over
the Southern Rockies and parts of the Southwest on Tuesday. The
fire weather threat is due to gusty winds, dry fuels, and low
relative humidity. On Wednesday, the threat of Critical Risk of
fire weather continues over parts of the Southern Rockies.

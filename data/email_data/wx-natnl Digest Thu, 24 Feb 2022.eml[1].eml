Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1030 AM CST Wed Feb 23 2022

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTH-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND FAR
WESTERN TRANS-PECOS...

Given the observed location of the cold front in the Trans-Pecos,
sustained elevated conditions appear much less probable. Strong, dry
downslope winds may penetrate the cold air on a localized basis, but
spatial extent and duration will be minimal. Highlights have been
removed from these areas. Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track
and is unchanged.

..Wendt.. 02/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CST Wed Feb 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a potent upper trough and jet streak are forecast
to move out of the southern Great Basin and across the southern
Rockies through this evening. Ahead of the trough, a backdoor cold
front is forecast to slowly move westward as an arctic airmass
spills into the southern Plains. Strong southwesterly winds are
expected at the surface ahead of the front across southern NM and
far southwest Texas. In combination with dry surface conditions, the
gusty winds will support critical fire weather conditions within dry
fuels.

...Southern New Mexico and Trans Pecos...
As the aforementioned upper trough/jet move eastward into the
southern Rockies, warm and dry surface conditions will be present
within a well-mixed boundary layer. Evident on regional model
soundings, the deep boundary layer will intersect with strong flow
aloft, facilitating efficient momentum transfer to the surface.
Widespread winds of 25-35 mph and higher gusts are expected through
the afternoon. In conjunction with the strong winds and dry fuels,
surface humidity ranging from 6 to 15% will support widespread
critical fire weather conditions across southern NM and southwest
TX.

Farther southeast along the Rio Grande Valley, weaker winds are
expected through the day due to the later arrival of the upper
trough and jet. Westerly downslope flow off the Mexican High Plateau
will still likely reach 10-20 mph through afternoon, with adiabatic
drying supporting surface RH of 10-20%. Dry fuels and the favorable
meteorological conditions will support elevated fire weather
conditions through the day. A low risk for fire weather conditions
may linger after dark with the arrival of stronger mid-level winds.
However, the decoupling boundary layer and RH recoveries near 50%
will likely limit the potential for significant fire weather
concerns overnight.

109 PM EST Wed Feb 23 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 26 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 2 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in good agreement on
the overall synoptic scale pattern on Saturday.  However,
noteworthy shortwave and timing differences become apparent as
early as Sunday, with the 12Z ECMWF more amplified with the
southern stream trough crossing the Southern Plains and Deep South
through Monday night, and the CMC stronger with the Pacific trough
reaching the West Coast and moving inland across the Intermountain
West.  Major timing differences are apparent across central Canada
with the next northern stream shortwave dropping southward, with
the GFS much much progressive than the ECMWF, whilst the CMC is
less pronounced with this same shortwave.  The models are also
struggling with how that shortwave from Canada potentially
interacts with the Pacific trough exiting the Rockies, and this
leads to a more uncertain forecast from the Upper Midwest to the
Northeast through the early to middle of next week.

At the time of the fronts/pressures preparation, the blend was
weighted more heavily towards the GFS/CMC/UKMET/GEFS mean since
there was better ensemble clustering for a stronger trough across
the eastern U.S. early next week, whereas the 00Z ECMWF was more
zonal and did not have as much ensemble support.  Given the
increasing uncertainty by Tuesday-Wednesday, the forecast was
hedged more on the GEFS/ECENS along with some of the CMC/GFS and
previous WPC continuity. /Hamrick

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early to mid next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
18 UTC GEFS mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Despite
reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolution, emphasis on any
individual model does not seem prudent given recent run to run
continuity issues and variance with embedded weather features.
While southern stream differences actually seem a bit less
pronounced than yesterday, the last few ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble
mean runs trended much flatter over the central to eastern U.S.
with northern stream upper troughing this weekend into early next
week despite amplified upstream ridging over western North
America. While embedded system wavelength spacing could support
this trend around a Hudson Bay vortex position, instead have
leaned the WPC solution to a more amplified and colder 18 UTC GEFS
mean or probably the slightly less amplified 00 UTC GEFS mean.
This plan best maintains WPC product continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will also favor drier
conditions. An exception may be across the south-central to
southeastern U.S. where precipitation could return this weekend.
This will be mainly in the form of light to moderate cold rains,
but with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the
swath of precipitation. In addition, modest precipitation is
expected to develop for the Pacific Northwest/Northern CA this
weekend with slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.
Precipitation totals are forecast to increase over the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA and gradually spread across the northwestern
states early-mid next week, including terrain enhanced snows.

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

..Wendt.. 02/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CST Wed Feb 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
As the strong western US trough ejects eastward across the southern
Rockies/Plains early Thursday, the system will gradually begin to
deamplify as the attendant mid-level jet races ahead. A surface low
and Pacific front over the southern Rockies will move southeastward,
weakening as they approach the Arctic airmass across the southern
Plains. Behind the front, gusty westerly winds and cooler
temperatures will overspread much of the Southwest. The gusty winds
may remain strong enough to support a low-end fire weather risk
across southern NM and southwest TX Thursday.

...Southern New Mexico and Southwest Texas...
The cold front and surface low are forecast to weaken significantly
as they transit southern NM/southwest TX early Thursday morning.
This will result in a slackening of the westerly surface pressure
gradient through much of the day. Despite the weakening, some model
soundings do show sufficient mid-level flow to potentially support
winds of 10-20 mph through the afternoon. The cooler but drier
airmass behind the front should also remain favorable for surface RH
of 15-25% through the diurnal cycle. Dry fuels and the somewhat
favorable meteorological conditions suggest that locally elevated
fire weather conditions are possible through the afternoon hours,
though considerable uncertainty remains. Highlights will be withheld
for now, though a small elevated area may be needed if greater model
consensus is reached.

...Significant winter storm impacts the Southern Plains/Ohio
Valley/Northeast/Mid-Atlantic into Friday...

...Risk of Excessive rainfall from the Tennessee Valley into the
Upper Ohio Valley into Friday morning...

...Record cold for parts of the Plains & West while record warmth
holds on for sections of the Southeast...

Through the remainder of the work week, the upper level pattern
over the contiguous United States features a persistent cold upper
level trough -- with the jet stream dipping south into northern
Mexico -- which will continue record-breaking cold both overnight
and in the afternoon across portions of the Plains and West.  A
persistent Southeast Ridge threatens record highs -- with
temperatures rising well into the 80s -- across the Southeast and
Florida.  In and near the transition zone between those two areas
across the Southern & Central Plains, Mid-South, Midwest, Great
Lakes, and Northeast will be where active weather is expected.

A storm over the Southwest will move eastward to the Southern
Rockies by Thursday morning. On Thursday, the storm will redevelop
over the Tennessee Valley and move northeastward to the Central
Appalachians/ Mid-Atlantic by Friday. The storm will produce heavy
snow over the Southwest and Central Rockies on Wednesday, with
light rain over parts of Southern California and rain at lower
elevations of the Southwest.  A variety of winter hazards await
the Southern Plains through the Ohio Valley Wednesday through
Thursday night and the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Thursday night
through Friday. Damaging ice accumulations across the Ozarks up to
0.50 inch leading to power outages and tree damage are expected.
This ice is within a swath of notable accumulations of freezing
rain expected from North Texas through the Mid-Mississippi Valley.
Overnight Thursday, snow will develop over parts of the Middle
Mississippi Valley into the Great Lakes. As the system moves to
the Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic on Friday morning, heavy
snow will develop over parts of the Northeast into Southern New
England. Widespread amounts of 6-12 inches are forecast.  A
freezing rain area is likely from the Eastern Ohio Valley through
the Central Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic States. Significant
ice accumulations are possible across south-central Pennsylvania
and western Maryland.  Widespread hazardous travel and damage to
the power infrastructure are anticipated.

An incoming cold front sent along its way by waves of low pressure
will force strong moisture/instability influx from the Gulf of
Mexico in its advance, producing heavy rain over Tennessee/Upper
Ohio Valleys. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall exists for this
area through Friday morning which is where heavy rains are most
likely to overlap with saturating soils. The heavy rain will
create localized to widely scattered instances of flash flooding,
with urban areas and locations with saturated soils the most
vulnerable.

A disturbance aloft moving southward from Western Canada will move
over the Pacific Northwest early Thursday morning and the Central
Rockies by Friday. For Thursday, the energy will produce light
snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest down to the coast and
inland to the Northern and Central Rockies.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed February 23 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 01 - 05 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in general agreement =
on large-scale mid-level
features across North America, but models diverge on the position, evolutio=
n,
and strength of these mid-level anomalies, and these differences result in
significant differences in the temperature and precipitation tools. A flat
ridge with above normal 500-hPa heights should cover most of the CONUS,
although the northward extent of this feature is uncertain. Farther north, =
a
mid-level trough centered over eastern Canada.will gradually expand
southwestward, but there is model disagreement on how far south and west th=
is
trough will extend, and how low 500-hPa heights will be. Meanwhile, a stron=
g
500-hPa ridge centered north of Alaska will build southward, eventually
resulting in a full-latitude mid-level ridge reaching southward through Ala=
ska
to the North Pacific, but the timing and evolution of this developing ridge
also differs among the models. In addition, there is no broad consensus amo=
ng
teleconnections centered on the primary 500-hPa height anomaly centers, but
indicators lean toward a pattern that features  a moderate mid-level trough=
 in
northeastern Canada with near-normal 500-hPa heights weakly extending
southwestward into southern British Columba. To the south, generally above
normal 500-hPa heights will extend across most of the CONUS as a flat ridge=
,
but above normal heights should reach farther north and east in the eastern
CONUS than along the Pacific Coast, where the weak trough farther north wil=
l
suppress heights slightly in the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, the ridge no=
rth
of Alaska will begin building southward, eventually resulting in a
full-latitude ridge over (?) the North Pacific late in the period, although
models differ on the evolution of this ridge. The models best reflecting th=
e
pattern slightly favored by the teleconnection tool were preferred, as were
their temperature and precipitation tools.

There are enhanced chances for above normal temperatures across a large par=
t
of
the CONUS under above normal 500 h-Pa heights, but the odds are lower in th=
e
East. Very early in the period, unusually cold air will be exiting the regi=
on,
to be quickly replaced by much warmer air. Models do not agree on how quick=
ly
this happens, but the European operational model and the European ensembles
push warmer air into the East more quickly than the others, and since the
European has performed slightly better than other model ensembles recently,
the
consolidation also favors a faster push of warm air into the eastern CONUS.
The
outlook also leans in this direction, but with reduced certainty farther ea=
st
where a few models and tools slow the retreat of the cold air and do not sh=
ow
elevated chances for above normal temperatures for the period as a whole. T=
he
best chances for above normal temperatures (over 60 percent) are under the
largest positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the central Great Plains, and
extend into the Southwest. Below normal temperatures are favored only in
northern New England, where mid-level heights are lower closer to the easte=
rn
Canadian trough. Meanwhile, the strong ridge building across Alaska should
bring above normal temperatures to the entire state, particularly toward th=
e
end of the period..

An active storm track ahead of a mean mid-level trough over the Bering Sea
favors increased above normal precipitation probabilities across most of
Alaska, especially along the western tier of the state. Meanwhile, the
flattening ridge in the southwestern CONUS, increasing 500-hPa heights in t=
he
central and eastern states, and the weak trough farther north favor a
significant area with enhanced chances for above normal precipitation
extending
from the Pacific Northwest to the northern Great Lakes Region, reflecting a
favored storm track position. Farther south, under the flat ridge, odds fav=
or
below normal precipitation from the Southwest to the southern half of the
eastern CONUS.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered on Day 8, 25% of Today=
's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is below
average, 2 out of 5, with general model agreement on the mean circulation
pattern offset by some significant disagreement in the forecast temperature
and
precipitation fields in the forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 03 - 09 2022

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa flow pattern is forecast to b=
e
dominated by very strong ridging predicted over the North Pacific extending
north through Alaska and toward the North Pole. This ridge axis is retrogra=
ded
west of the mean position for the 6 to 10 day period, stronger, and highly
meridional from the mid-latitudes to the Arctic. Downstream, the weak troug=
h
extending into western North America during the 6 to 10 day period should
strengthen somewhat, bringing slightly below normal 500-hPa heights from th=
e
northern Plains southwestward into much of the western CONUS. This
strengthening trough, which reaches into a stronger mid-level trough in
eastern
Canada, will begin to reduce 500-hPa heights in the to the south and east,
across the central and eastern CONUS, pushing the largest positive 500-hPa
height anomalies into the Southeast.

Enhanced above normal temperature probabilities are favored for all of Alas=
ka
due to mean southerly flow associated with the strong full-latitude ridge.
Chances for above normal temperatures top 60 percent along the western tier=
 of
the state. Meanwhile, increased chances for below normal temperatures cover=
 a
much larger area than yesterday, now reaching across most of the Far West, =
the
central and northern Rockies and Plains, and the northern Great Lakes Regio=
n
under the influence of the mean mid-level trough and below normal 500-hPa
heights expected to cover this region. Farther south, the flattening ridge
will
limit the extent of enhanced chances for warmer than normal temperatures to
the
southern Plains and the southeastern quarter of the CONUS.

The broadening trough and resultant storm track will establish increased od=
ds
for above normal precipitation across most areas from the central and north=
ern
Rockies through the southern Plains and into the northern Ohio Valley. Heav=
ier
than normal precipitation could extend southward across central Texas. Sout=
h
and west of the anticipated mean mid-level ridge, below normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored for most of the Southeast and along the western and southwestern
fringes of the CONUS. Meanwhile, near and west of the strong ridge over
Alaska,
a stormy pattern is expected to continue into week-2 in the expected humid,
southerly flow.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Da=
y
11, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is below
average, 2 out of 5, due to general agreement between model forecasts on th=
e
mean circulation pattern, offset by significant disparities in the models=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD
evolution of individual features and disparities in the temperature and
precipitation fields among the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
327 PM EST Wed Feb 23 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Feb 26 2022 - 12Z Wed Mar 02 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance suite is in good agreement on
the overall synoptic scale pattern on Saturday.  However,
noteworthy shortwave and timing differences become apparent as
early as Sunday, with the 12Z ECMWF more amplified with the
southern stream trough crossing the Southern Plains and Deep South
through Monday night, and the CMC stronger with the Pacific trough
reaching the West Coast and moving inland across the Intermountain
West.  Major timing differences are apparent across central Canada
with the next northern stream shortwave dropping southward, with
the GFS much much progressive than the ECMWF, whilst the CMC is
less pronounced with this same shortwave.  The models are also
struggling with how that shortwave from Canada potentially
interacts with the Pacific trough exiting the Rockies, and this
leads to a more uncertain forecast from the Upper Midwest to the
Northeast through the early to middle of next week.

At the time of the fronts/pressures preparation, the blend was
weighted more heavily towards the GFS/CMC/UKMET/GEFS mean since
there was better ensemble clustering for a stronger trough across
the eastern U.S. early next week, whereas the 00Z ECMWF was more
zonal and did not have as much ensemble support.  Given the
increasing uncertainty by Tuesday-Wednesday, the forecast was
hedged more on the GEFS/ECENS along with some of the CMC/GFS and
previous WPC continuity. /Hamrick
-------------------------------

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early to mid next week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from the
18 UTC GEFS mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Despite
reasonably similar larger scale pattern evolution, emphasis on any
individual model does not seem prudent given recent run to run
continuity issues and variance with embedded weather features.
While southern stream differences actually seem a bit less
pronounced than yesterday, the last few ECMWF and ECMWF ensemble
mean runs trended much flatter over the central to eastern U.S.
with northern stream upper troughing this weekend into early next
week despite amplified upstream ridging over western North
America. While embedded system wavelength spacing could support
this trend around a Hudson Bay vortex position, instead have
leaned the WPC solution to a more amplified and colder 18 UTC GEFS
mean or probably the slightly less amplified 00 UTC GEFS mean.
This plan best maintains WPC product continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will also favor drier
conditions. An exception may be across the south-central to
southeastern U.S. where precipitation could return this weekend.
This will be mainly in the form of light to moderate cold rains,
but with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the
swath of precipitation. In addition, modest precipitation is
expected to develop for the Pacific Northwest/Northern CA this
weekend with slow approach of northeast Pacific systems.
Precipitation totals are forecast to increase over the Pacific
Northwest/northern CA and gradually spread across the northwestern
states early-mid next week, including terrain enhanced snows.

...Pattern Overview...

Overall cold and drier conditions are slated for much of the lower
48 states this weekend into early next week to be followed by
broad moderation of temperatures spreading from the West to the
East early through mid next week in transition to less amplified
upper level flow.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean, the 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models
in a pattern with near average predictability. Models and
ensembles offer a reasonably similar larger scale pattern
evolution, but continue to offer run to run continuity issues and
variance with smaller scale embedded weather features. Composite
blending tends to mitigate these differences consistent with their
varied individual predictability. The strategy acts to maintain
max WPC product continuity and a composite of latest 00 UTC model
and ensemble guidance remains generally supportive.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Cold high pressure will settle across much of the country by this
weekend into next week. The weather pattern will favor drier
conditions. However, northern stream impulses will likely produce
periodic light northern tier snows from the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes through the Northeast. Also expect a swath of modest
precipitation will traverse the Southeast into Sunday/Monday. This
will be mainly in the form of light to moderate cold rains, but
with some snow/ice threat on the northern periphery of the swath
of precipitation. In addition, precipitation will to develop for
the Pacific Northwest/Northern CA this weekend with slow approach
of northeast Pacific systems. Precipitation totals are forecast to
increase over the Pacific Northwest/northern CA and increasingly
spread  across the northwestern states through early and mid next
week with upper trough and associated lead frontal system approach
and passage. This pattern will including locally terrain enhancing
heavier snows.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As the strong upper trough moves out of the Great Basin and across
the southern Rockies today, much cooler air will fill in across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. Surface pressure gradients will
weaken, but may support occasional gusty winds across southern and
eastern New Mexico. Some low-end fire weather potential will be
possible across eastern New Mexico, though fuels have moderated.

...Eastern New Mexico...
Winds across much of southern and eastern New Mexico will weaken
through the day behind a Pacific front associated with the departing
upper trough. While gradients will weaken, gusty winds of 10-20 mph
will likely linger through the afternoon. Light overnight
precipitation, cloud cover and cooler temperatures should limit
diurnal RH minimums with most of the area expected to be near 15-25%
through peak heating. Widespread overlap of strong winds and dry
surface conditions is not expected. In addition, the colder
temperatures and better RH recoveries overnight will likely moderate
fuel dryness. The overall situation appear to favor only locally
elevated fire weather conditions across portions of southern and
eastern New Mexico for a few hours this afternoon.

...Significant winter storm impacting the Southern Plains to the
Ohio Valley on Thursday into late Thursday night then the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic Thursday afternoon into Friday...

...a Slight Risk of Excessive rainfall from the Tennessee and Ohio
Valley on through Friday morning...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 35 degrees below average over the
Northern/Central Rockies, Plains, and the Mississippi Valley; In
contrast, temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average over
the Southeast...

By Thursday afternoon, a storm over the South Rockies will move
eastward to western Texas. Then the storm will redevelop over the
Tennessee Valley and move northeastward to the Ohio Valley/Central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic by Friday. The storm will move off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast by Friday evening. On Thursday morning, the
upper-level system will produce snow over the Southwest/Great
Basin and Central Rockies. The snow will end over the area by the
late afternoon.

Moreover, as the storm moves out of the Southern Rockies, the
system will bring a variety of winter hazards from the Southern
Plains through the Ohio Valley Thursday through Friday morning and
the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Thursday afternoon through Friday
evening. Damaging ice accumulations across the Ozarks up to 0.50
inches leading to power outages and tree damage are possible. This
ice is within a swath of notable accumulations of rain/freezing
rain and sleet expected from North Texas through the
Mid-Mississippi Valley. Overnight Thursday, the heavy snow will
develop over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley into the Great
Lakes, moving into the Northeast early Friday morning. As the
system proceeds to the Central Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic on Friday
morning, heavy snow will develop over parts of the Northeast into
Southern New England. Widespread amounts greater than 6 inches of
snow are likely. Another rain/freezing rain area is expected from
the Eastern Ohio Valley through the Central Appalachians.
Significant ice accumulations are possible across south-central
Pennsylvania and western Maryland. Prepare now for this major
winter storm. Widespread hazardous travel and damage to the power
infrastructure are expected.

Additional impacts will be temperatures 15 to 35 degrees below
average over the Northern/Central Rockies, Plains, and the
Mississippi Valley. As a result, several locations will have
record-breaking or tied low temperatures. In contrast,
temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average over the
Southeast, with several sites having record-breaking or tied high
temperatures from Thursday into Friday morning.

In the meantime, the associated cold front extending from the
Southeast to the Central Gulf Coast will have a strong stream of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico that overruns the front producing
heavy rain over Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with heavy rain over
parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys through Friday morning.
The heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable. Furthermore, the rain will continue from the
Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys into the Western Gulf Coast
overnight Thursday into Friday morning.

Lastly, upper-level energy moving southward from Western Canada
will move over the Pacific Northwest on Thursday morning and to
the Central Rockies by Saturday. For Thursday, the energy will
produce light snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest down to sea
level and inland to the Northern Rockies. Overnight Thursday, the
light snow moves into the Central Rockies and ends by Saturday. On
Friday afternoon, moisture will surge into southern Texas,
producing rain through Saturday.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Mid and upper-level flow across the CONUS is forecast to gradually
become more zonal as the southern US trough begins to deamplify
Friday. Cold temperatures will persist within the Arctic airmass
across the much of the center of the country. Cooler temperatures
are also expected across the Southwest, moderating fuels and
increasing overnight humidity recoveries. The increase in humidity
coupled with a decrease in surface winds across much of the region
will limit fire weather potential Friday. While some locally
elevated fire weather conditions may occur with gusty downslope
winds across eastern New Mexico, widespread fire weather concerns
are not expected.

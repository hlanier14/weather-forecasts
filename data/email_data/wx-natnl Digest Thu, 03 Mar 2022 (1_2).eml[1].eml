Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1014 AM CST Wed Mar 02 2022

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 03/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Wed Mar 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
Expansive mid/upper-level ridging will remain centered over the
western states, while the southern periphery of strong northwesterly
flow aloft extends across the central Plains and Lower Missouri
Valley. At the surface, a cold front will move southward across the
northern and central Plains.

...Central/Southern Plains into the Lower Missouri Valley...
As maximum temperatures climb into the upper 70s to lower 80s,
widespread 10-20 percent RH will develop across the region. Ahead of
the approaching cold front, sustained west-southwesterly surface
winds may reach 10-15 mph (with gusts up to 20 mph) across portions
of eastern Kansas, northeastern Oklahoma, and western Missouri.
Here, the combination of critically low RH, locally breezy surface
winds, and dry fuels could support spotty elevated conditions.
However, the lack of a tighter pressure gradient and modest
sustained surface winds cast uncertainty on the overall fire-weather
threat -- precluding highlights at this time.

...Southeast...
A very dry antecedent airmass will remain in place, supporting
minimum afternoon RH of 15-20 percent where fuels continue to dry.
While the critically low RH and drying fuels do raise fire-weather
concerns, generally light sustained surface winds (10 mph or less)
should limit the overall fire-weather threat.

...Heavy snow potential over the Northern Plains through Upper
Great Lakes and possibly into northern New England during the
weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Guidance maintains the forecast of a positively tilted mean trough
from Canada into the western U.S., between a strong ridge over the
eastern Pacific and another ridge that meanders over or near the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico. This configuration will support an
active weather pattern, with a couple episodes of precipitation
over parts of the West and likely one or more areas of significant
rain and snow over some areas of the central and eastern U.S. The
system having highest confidence will track northeastward from the
central Rockies/Plains into the Upper Great Lakes this weekend
with a corresponding band of snow from the north-central High
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes and possibly northern New
England. A trailing upper low reaching the West should ultimately
produce another surface wave, along the first system's cold front,
that takes a somewhat farther southeast track but whose details
are otherwise less certain. This evolution may support an area of
heavy rainfall over parts of the east-central U.S. late weekend
into early next week and possibly some wintry weather on the cold
side of the second wave. Below normal temperatures initially over
the West and northern Plains will expand into the rest of the
central U.S. while frontal progression will gradually trim the
western extent of much above normal temperature anomalies over the
central/eastern states.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

After some significant variability and spread in recent days,
guidance over the past day appears to be stabilizing within the
stronger half of the prior envelope for strength as the initial
surface low and shortwave reach the Upper Great Lakes early Sunday
while maintaining decent continuity for track, with just a bit of
east/west spread. Consensus continues to show better definition of
the initial low as it continues northeastward into the Canadian
Maritimes by Sunday morning, along with a slight shift of the
shortwave and cold front southward overall compared to the
previous cycle. The pattern remains complex behind the leading
wave, as a likely closed upper low in the West over the weekend
ejects east early in the workweek, but is muddled by shortwave
energy dropping into the West immediately behind it and also
separate upper troughing that drops into the northern Plains and
vicinity. While a cold front is likely ahead of the mean trough,
guidance continues to waffle with placement of waves of low
pressure along it. The 00Z ECMWF and 06Z GEFS means showed a
position for the low near the Indiana/Ohio border early Monday,
with more variability in position among deterministic models, but
the newer 12Z models have started to cluster better approximately
in that location. Then upstream, there are ample differences in
the details of the pattern by Tuesday-Wednesday given multiple
interacting low predictability shortwaves. The ECMWF and CMC have
been persistent in holding troughing back across the Southwest in
a very positively tilted form, while GFS runs have showed more
progressive troughing. The 00Z EC/CMC pattern is almost outside
the envelope of ensemble members with this Southwest trough. Thus
somewhat preferred the GFS solutions along with the "middle
ground" EC mean. Newer 12Z guidance shows a faster trough in the
EC/CMC and slower in the GFS, so perhaps a consensus is being
reached, at least temporarily.

Early in the period a blend of the 00Z/06Z operational GFS, ECMWF,
and CMC models provided a reasonable starting point for the
forecast. The 00Z UKMET was an outlier with portions of the
pattern, with a slightly eastern track of the main closed upper
low in the West compared to consensus, but more so with much
stronger upstream energy coming into western Canada and
suppressing the eastern Pacific ridge by Monday. The ensemble
means did have a hint of this, and the 00Z GFS was most like them,
but not to the extreme of the UKMET. The UKMET seemed reasonable
across the East though. Then as the period progressed, introduced
and increased weighting of the ensemble means, particularly the EC
mean that showed a deeper trough in the Southwest but not to the
extreme of the operational EC and CMC.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Across the West, the leading system emerging into the Plains may
produce some central Rockies snow early in the weekend while the
system immediately behind it spreads rain and higher elevation
snow primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and central
Rockies. Expect generally light to moderate totals but with some
locally heavier totals possible. There is continued potential for
another system to spread mostly light to moderate precipitation
into the Northwest/northern Rockies during the first half of next
week but with less than ideal confidence in the details.

To the east of the Rockies, the leading system forecast to track
from the central Plains through Upper Great Lakes during the
weekend should spread wintry precipitation from the north-central
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. The storm may be strong
enough to produce some brisk winds, with specifics to be resolved
in coming days. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the
trailing cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday and the Lower Mississippi
Valley on Sunday per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Guidance is still showing potential for heavier rainfall
within an area from the southeastern Plains into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into early next
week, and there is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in place in
WPC's newly experimental Day 5 outlook. This threat corresponds to
slower progression of the trailing front as it becomes more
aligned with flow aloft, interaction with low level Gulf moisture,
and the possibility of one or more waves that would provide added
rainfall focus. The northwestern fringe of this moisture shield
should contain some wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat
southeast of the first episode. Specifics will depend on
lower-confidence wave details which will take additional time to
resolve. One change with this forecast cycle was model guidance
taking the bulk of the rainfall eastward rather than southward as
the cold front progresses, so trended down with QPF over the Gulf
Coast states, but this is still subject to change.

Colder air initially over the western U.S. and northern Plains and
spreading over the rest of the central U.S. into early next week
should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F below
normal. Best potential for locally colder anomalies, especially
for highs, will be over the northern/central High Plains. Leading
warm sector air, initially focused over the central-southern
Plains and southern two-thirds of the East on Saturday, will
become more pronounced over the East by Sunday-Monday when plus
10-25F above normal anomalies for highs and localized higher
anomalies for morning lows may challenge daily records for
highs/warm lows. Highest concentration of record highs may be over
the Southeast with a few record highs elsewhere, such as the
Mid-Atlantic. Coverage of record warm lows may be broader. After
Monday, frontal progression will increasingly confine the warmth
to the Southeast, with record warmth remaining possible in Florida.

300 PM EST March 02 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the dynamical models in regards to =
the
strength and evolution of mid-level low pressure over the western half of t=
he
contiguous U.S. at the beginning of the period. Model differences increase,
however, by the middle of the period. The 0Z GEFS and Canadian ensemble mea=
ns
indicate gradual weakening of this mid-level low pressure and an eastward
shift, whereas the 0Z ECMWF shows mid-level low pressure reloading across t=
he
West and then shifting eastward. Despite these differences, there are
increased
chances for much below normal temperatures across the western two thirds of
the
contiguous U.S., with decreasing chances for this risk across the
Intermountain
West by the middle of the period. Surface low formation over the Mississipp=
i
Valley increases the potential for heavy precipitation over flood prone are=
as
of the east-central CONUS. Prevailing mid-level high pressure forecast for
much
of the eastern U.S. and Alaska is favored to bring more tranquil conditions
during week-2.

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 10 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 16: By the outset of week-2, there =
is
good agreement among the dynamical model 500-hPa height forecasts depicting=
 a
negative Pacific-North America (PNA) pattern, with full latitude coverage o=
f
negative height departures extending from Canada to northern Mexico during =
the
period. By day 10 (Mar 12), there is increasing divergence across the model=
s
regarding the evolution of the mid-level trough, with the 0Z GEFS and Canad=
ian
ensemble means gradually weakening this feature and being more progressive
while the 0Z ECMWF showing quicker weakening of this initial trough with a =
new
trough reloading across the Northwest by Mar 12 and propagating eastward wi=
th
time. The 0Z GEFS ensemble mean generally shows more negative 500 hPa heigh=
t
departures compared to yesterday, whereas the 0Z ECMWF has weaker departure=
s.
Despite these model differences regarding the details of the evolution of t=
he
mid-level pattern, general troughing across the western two-thirds of the
CONUS
favors increased chances for much below normal temperatures during week-2.



A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for much of the
Intermountain West, Mar 10 to 12, with the expectation that the likelihood =
for
minimum temperatures reaching hazardous thresholds diminishes towards the
middle of the period. A separate area is highlighted with a slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures across the central CONUS for a longer duration, M=
ar
10 to 15, where the extreme cold signal is more likely to persist. The GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and temperatures ranging to below 0 D=
eg
F
across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest to below freezing across the
South. The slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the central
CONUS has been extended further in time compared to yesterday's outlook due=
 to
the ECMWF ensemble mean mid-level troughing sinking further south in today'=
s
outlook compared to yesterday. This translates to the ECMWF reforecast tool
showing a broader area of extreme cold across this region, which aligns wit=
h
the GEFS extreme cold signal toward the end of the period. By the end of th=
e
period there are increasing signs of anomalous ridging developing over the
West
Coast, and the aforementioned troughing shifting eastward over the eastern
CONUS by the middle of March. A moderate risk of much below normal
temperatures
is designated for portions of the Northern Rockies, Northern and Central
Plains, and the Upper Mississippi Valley, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforeca=
st
tool show at least a 40% chance of minimum temperatures reaching thresholds
deemed hazardous. The more amplified trough in the GEFS translates to the G=
EFS
reforecast tool having higher probabilities of reaching hazardous threshold=
s
over a greater area of reaching hazardous thresholds compared to the ECMWF.



Across the southwestern and south-central CONUS, the strengthening trough
favored aloft is expected to be conducive for elevated winds throughout thi=
s
part of the country. This is supported by strong surface pressure gradients=
 in
the deterministic and ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools through the
middle of the period. The slight risk of high winds highlighted from the Fo=
ur
Corners region to the southern Plains is issued for Mar 10 to 12, a slightl=
y
shorter period than yesterday's outlook due to the decreasing signal for hi=
gh
wind speeds in recent deterministic models and increased uncertainty regard=
ing
the surface pattern. Enhanced high wind risk potential increases the risk o=
f
wildfires and dust storms given low soil moisture content and the widesprea=
d
severe to extreme drought conditions currently registered in the region.



Frontal activity across the south-central and southeastern CONUS in additio=
n
to
advection of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico into the region may support
enhanced precipitation across the region at the beginning of the period. A
similar area is highlighted, compared to yesterday, for a slight risk of he=
avy
precipitation across parts of the Tennessee Valley, Lower Mississippi Valle=
y,
Southern Appalachians, and Southeast, Mar 10 to 12, based on the reforecast
tools and uncalibrated model guidance. The slight risk of heavy snow is
removed
in today's outlook due to increased uncertainty in today's guidance regardi=
ng
possible surface low formation across the South-Central CONUS at the beginn=
ing
of the period. Recent deterministic GFS runs continue to indicate the
potential
for heavy snow across portions of the Midwest associated with the possible
surface low. However, there is a significant variety in the solutions
regarding
the location and evolution of this possible storm. Additionally, the
uncalibrated ECMWF has backed off on this heavy snow signal.



Over Alaska, amplified mid-level ridging forecast over much of the northern
Pacific and the Bering Sea is expected to lead to unseasonably warm
temperatures. No hazards are anticipated for Alaska at this time. However, =
the
persistence of above normal temperatures over Alaska bears monitoring as th=
e
state approaches the river ice breakup season later this spring.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 PM CST Wed Mar 02 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

The previous forecast generally remains on track. Elevated
highlights have been expanded across the southern High Plains to
account for the latest guidance consensus. Widespread 15-20 mph
sustained winds and 10-15 percent RH are expected to overspread
critically dry fuels through the afternoon hours. At least locally
Critical conditions are expected, especially along the New
Mexico/Colorado border vicinity. Limited areal coverage is the
primary reason for withholding Critical highlights. However,
widespread high-end Elevated fire weather conditions are expected
given how highly receptive fuels are to wildfire spread.

..Squitieri.. 03/02/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CST Wed Mar 02 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will gradually breakdown across the western
CONUS, as increasing cyclonic flow begins to overspread the
Intermountain West ahead of an approaching large-scale trough. At
the surface, high pressure will infiltrate the northern Plains and
Upper MS Valley, while lee troughing begins to develop over the High
Plains.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
In response to the developing lee trough over the High Plains,
southerly sustained surface winds of 15 mph will develop amid 5-15
percent RH during the afternoon hours. This will result in elevated
fire-weather conditions, with spotty critical conditions possible.

...Southwest...
Dry and breezy conditions will be possible ahead of the approaching
large-scale trough, though the lack of a tighter surface pressure
gradient casts uncertainty on the fire-weather threat. Therefore,
highlights will not be added at this time, though trends will be
monitored closely.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry/breezy post-frontal air mass will be in place over portions of
the Mid-Atlantic, potentially resulting in locally elevated
fire-weather conditions across areas that have not received
substantial precipitation over the last week. However, these
conditions look too marginal and localized for any highlights.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed March 02 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 08 - 12 2022

A high amplitude pattern is likely during early to mid-March as a full-
latitude
ridge extends across the North Pacific and Alaska with a downstream trough
over
the west-central CONUS. This longwave pattern continues to favor above norm=
al
temperatures for much of Mainland Alaska, while below normal temperatures a=
re
likely from the West Coast to the Mississippi Valley. Arctic high pressure
centered over the higher latitudes of western North America elevates
probabilities of below normal temperatures for the Alaska Panhandle. Large
probabilities (more than 80 percent) for below normal temperatures are
forecast
across much of the northern Rockies to the northern Great Plains where
anomalous cold is likely during this 5-day period with Arctic high pressure
shifting south from Canada. To the east of a predicted storm track, above
normal temperatures are favored along and east of the Appalachians.
Anomalously
strong subtropical ridging for March results in probabilities exceeding 80
percent for above normal temperatures across central and south Florida.

Above-normal precipitation is favored from the lower Mississippi Valley
northeast to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast due to the likelihood that at
least
one wave of low pressure tracks along a nearly stationary front.  Following
several weeks of drier-than-normal conditions, a southward displaced surfac=
e
front is expected to bring a period of wetter weather to parts of the
Southeast. An amplified trough is likely to result in surface low developme=
nt
across the central High Plains with a subsequent northeastward track to the
Great Lakes. Enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation are forec=
ast
for much of the central Great Plains, Midwest, and Great Lakes. The deep
trough
aloft and predicted upslope surface flow favor above normal precipitation
across the northern to central Rockies and adjacent high Plains. A lack of
onshore flow and the inland axis of the 500-hPa trough supports near to bel=
ow
normal precipitation along the West Coast along with the desert Southwest a=
nd
southern Great Plains. A large area of Arctic high pressure over the higher
latitudes of western North America favors near to below normal precipitatio=
n
across most of eastern and northern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandl=
e,
while onshore flow slightly elevates probabilities for above normal
precipitation across southwestern Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement and continuity among model solutions with a high amplitude
pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 10 - 16 2022

Ensemble means diverge slightly on the longwave pattern over the CONUS duri=
ng
week-2 due to a weakening of the amplified 500-hPa ridge over the North
Pacific
and Alaska. Recent GEFS solutions depict an eastward progression of the
longwave trough axis with lower 500-hPa heights across the south-central an=
d
eastern CONUS. The ECMWF ensemble mean maintains a positively-tilted trough
axis across the west-central CONUS with a slightly stronger subtropical rid=
ge
over Florida. The Canadian ensemble mean is a good compromise between these
two
solutions and was weighted most heavily in creating the manual 500-hPa blen=
d.
A
broad, deep 500-hPa trough over North America, cross-polar flow at the high=
est
latitudes, and Arctic high pressure expanding south into the lower 48 favor=
s
below normal temperatures across a majority of the West, Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley and Midwest. Probabilities for below normal temperatures
are
slightly elevated for northern Maine as the anomalous cold over the Great
Lakes
is expected to expand eastward. Increasing 500-hPa heights support near nor=
mal
temperatures for California, the desert Southwest, and Rio Grande Valley.
Above
normal temperatures are favored along the coastal Southeast and Florida whe=
re
cold air advection is unlikely.

The broad trough increases probabilities for above normal precipitation acr=
oss
the northern Intermountain West, parts of the north-central Great Plains, a=
nd
much of the eastern CONUS. Upslope surface flow may enhance precipitation
amounts across the northern to central High Plains. Mean 500-hPa ridging ne=
ar
the West Coast and the predicted placement of the longwave ridge axis along=
 or
east of the Rockies favors below normal precipitation for much of Californi=
a,
the Southwest, and southern Great Plains. This dry signal is also consisten=
t
with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa during March.

Above normal 500-hPa heights favor near to above normal temperatures for
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Arctic high pressure, centered over west=
ern
Canada, elevates probabilities for below normal temperatures across the Ala=
ska
Panhandle. Precipitation tools continue a drying trend with an absence of
enhanced onshore flow. Therefore, near or below normal precipitation is
favored
throughout Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools for a majority of t=
he
forecast domain offset by growing uncertainty with a weakening ridge upstre=
am
over the North Pacific and Alaska.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

...Wintry mix will move across the Northeast through tomorrow
morning while persisting across the Northwest to Northern Plains...

...Above normal temperatures continue from the Great Basin to the
Southeast, with fire weather conditions worsening in the High
Plains...

...Cooler temperatures, lower elevation rain, and mountain snow
move into California, the Southwest, and Great Basin Friday...

A low pressure system will continue to move across the Northeast
through tomorrow morning as an arctic air mass spreads southward
behind a trailing cold front from the Northern Plains to the
Midwest and northern Mid-Atlantic. Snow accumulations should
generally remain between 1-2 inches, except in the Adirondacks
were locally higher totals are possible. Meanwhile, rain and snow
showers will continue over the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies as a lingering low pressure system moves slowly southward
and a moisture plume from the Pacific penetrates further inland
through northern Idaho and northwestern Montana across the arctic
front.  Farther east, periods of light snow are expected across
the Northern Plains as low pressure waves form along the arctic
front and move toward the east. Snow accumulations showed
generally remain light here as well, with totals of a few inches
confined to the higher mountain elevations of the northern
Cascades and Rockies and locations along the Canadian border in
the Northern Plains. A light glaze of freezing rain, up to 0.1
inches, is also possible from eastern Montana into the Dakotas as
warmer air aloft overrides the arctic front.

In contrast with the wintry conditions across the norther tier,
abnormally warm Spring-like temperatures are forecast from the
Great Basin to the Southeast Thursday, with widespread high
temperatures in the 70s. The warm weather becomes more focused
Friday over the Plains with highs into the low 80s, up to 25
degrees above normal for this time of year. The warm temperatures
combined with increasingly drier air and windy conditions as a lee
trough and eventual dryline move through the High Plains will lead
to increasing fire weather conditions. The Storm Prediction Center
has highlighted an Elevated Risk of fire weather conditions for
Thursday across portions of northeastern New Mexico, the Oklahoma
and Texas Panhandles, southeastern Colorado, and southwestern
Kansas. A Critical Risk has been highlighted for Friday across
eastern New Mexico.

Finally, a cold upper trough off the West Coast is forecast to
move onto the West Coast as the low pressure system in the Pacific
Northwest also continues southward.  This system will bring
increasingly unsettled weather into California by Thursday evening
and spread eastward into the Great Basin and Southwest Friday.
Highs in the 60s along the coast and across the Great Basin and
into the 80s in the Desert Southwest Thursday will drop 10 to 20
degrees behind an eastward moving Pacific front Friday. Lower
elevation rain and mountain snow will also continue to spread
eastward, with thunderstorms possible along the southern
California Coast.

...Heavy snow potential over the Northern Plains through Upper
Great Lakes and possibly into northern New England during the
weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Guidance maintains the forecast of a positively tilted mean trough
from Canada into the western U.S., between a strong ridge over the
eastern Pacific and another ridge that meanders over or near the
southeastern Gulf of Mexico. This configuration will support an
active weather pattern, with a couple episodes of precipitation
over parts of the West and likely one or more areas of significant
rain and snow over some areas of the central and eastern U.S. The
system having highest confidence will track northeastward from the
central Rockies/Plains into the Upper Great Lakes this weekend
with a corresponding band of snow from the north-central High
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes and possibly northern New
England. A trailing upper low reaching the West should ultimately
produce another surface wave, along the first system's cold front,
that takes a somewhat farther southeast track but whose details
are otherwise less certain. This evolution may support an area of
heavy rainfall over parts of the east-central U.S. late weekend
into early next week and possibly some wintry weather on the cold
side of the second wave. Below normal temperatures initially over
the West and northern Plains will expand into the rest of the
central U.S. while frontal progression will gradually trim the
western extent of much above normal temperature anomalies over the
central/eastern states.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

After some significant variability and spread in recent days,
guidance over the past day appears to be stabilizing within the
stronger half of the prior envelope for strength as the initial
surface low and shortwave reach the Upper Great Lakes early Sunday
while maintaining decent continuity for track, with just a bit of
east/west spread. Consensus continues to show better definition of
the initial low as it continues northeastward into the Canadian
Maritimes by Sunday morning, along with a slight shift of the
shortwave and cold front southward overall compared to the
previous cycle. The pattern remains complex behind the leading
wave, as a likely closed upper low in the West over the weekend
ejects east early in the workweek, but is muddled by shortwave
energy dropping into the West immediately behind it and also
separate upper troughing that drops into the northern Plains and
vicinity. While a cold front is likely ahead of the mean trough,
guidance continues to waffle with placement of waves of low
pressure along it. The 00Z ECMWF and 06Z GEFS means showed a
position for the low near the Indiana/Ohio border early Monday,
with more variability in position among deterministic models, but
the newer 12Z models have started to cluster better approximately
in that location. Then upstream, there are ample differences in
the details of the pattern by Tuesday-Wednesday given multiple
interacting low predictability shortwaves. The ECMWF and CMC have
been persistent in holding troughing back across the Southwest in
a very positively tilted form, while GFS runs have showed more
progressive troughing. The 00Z EC/CMC pattern is almost outside
the envelope of ensemble members with this Southwest trough. Thus
somewhat preferred the GFS solutions along with the "middle
ground" EC mean. Newer 12Z guidance shows a faster trough in the
EC/CMC and slower in the GFS, so perhaps a consensus is being
reached, at least temporarily.

Early in the period a blend of the 00Z/06Z operational GFS, ECMWF,
and CMC models provided a reasonable starting point for the
forecast. The 00Z UKMET was an outlier with portions of the
pattern, with a slightly eastern track of the main closed upper
low in the West compared to consensus, but more so with much
stronger upstream energy coming into western Canada and
suppressing the eastern Pacific ridge by Monday. The ensemble
means did have a hint of this, and the 00Z GFS was most like them,
but not to the extreme of the UKMET. The UKMET seemed reasonable
across the East though. Then as the period progressed, introduced
and increased weighting of the ensemble means, particularly the EC
mean that showed a deeper trough in the Southwest but not to the
extreme of the operational EC and CMC.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Across the West, the leading system emerging into the Plains may
produce some central Rockies snow early in the weekend while the
system immediately behind it spreads rain and higher elevation
snow primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the Wasatch and central
Rockies. Expect generally light to moderate totals but with some
locally heavier totals possible. There is continued potential for
another system to spread mostly light to moderate precipitation
into the Northwest/northern Rockies during the first half of next
week but with less than ideal confidence in the details.

To the east of the Rockies, the leading system forecast to track
from the central Plains through Upper Great Lakes during the
weekend should spread wintry precipitation from the north-central
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur). Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains just to the northwest of the surface
low track, with increasing chances over the northern Plains and
continued chances over the Upper Midwest. The storm may be strong
enough to produce some brisk winds, with specifics to be resolved
in coming days. Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the
trailing cold front. Embedded thunderstorms could be severe in the
Mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday and the Lower Mississippi
Valley on Sunday per the latest Storm Prediction Center extended
outlook. Guidance is still showing potential for heavier rainfall
within an area from the southeastern Plains into the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into early next
week, and there is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall in place in
WPC's newly experimental Day 5 outlook. This threat corresponds to
slower progression of the trailing front as it becomes more
aligned with flow aloft, interaction with low level Gulf moisture,
and the possibility of one or more waves that would provide added
rainfall focus. The northwestern fringe of this moisture shield
should contain some wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat
southeast of the first episode. Specifics will depend on
lower-confidence wave details which will take additional time to
resolve. One change with this forecast cycle was model guidance
taking the bulk of the rainfall eastward rather than southward as
the cold front progresses, so trended down with QPF over the Gulf
Coast states, but this is still subject to change.

Colder air initially over the western U.S. and northern Plains and
spreading over the rest of the central U.S. into early next week
should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F below
normal. Best potential for locally colder anomalies, especially
for highs, will be over the northern/central High Plains. Leading
warm sector air, initially focused over the central-southern
Plains and southern two-thirds of the East on Saturday, will
become more pronounced over the East by Sunday-Monday when plus
10-25F above normal anomalies for highs and localized higher
anomalies for morning lows may challenge daily records for
highs/warm lows. Highest concentration of record highs may be over
the Southeast with a few record highs elsewhere, such as the
Mid-Atlantic. Coverage of record warm lows may be broader. After
Monday, frontal progression will increasingly confine the warmth
to the Southeast, with record warmth remaining possible in Florida.

...Heavy rain potential across the Mid-Mississippi Valley into
Ohio Valley late Sunday into Monday...

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Threats...

An upper-level trough forecast to move through the southwestern
U.S. this weekend and then lift across the Plains early next week
will likely support the development of an elongated low pressure
system along a polar front to promote a heavy rain event across
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into Ohio Valley into Monday.  A winter
weather event should be ending across the upper Great Lakes Sunday
morning as the medium-range period begins.  The system will
possibly bring some snow/freezing rain across northern New England
Sunday morning and some snow Monday morning.  A swath of wintry
precipitation is forecast to quickly develop in its wake from the
central Plains through the lower Great Lakes and interior
Northeast Monday into Tuesday as the elongated low pressure system
tracks across.  Thereafter, a familiar pattern will tend to
re-establish across the U.S. as northern stream clippers tend to
slide east-southeast toward an eastern U.S. broad trough while a
subtropical jet tends to linger across the northern Gulf.  An
increasing chance of heavier rainfall appears to emerge across the
Deep South to the Gulf Coast toward the latter portion of next
week with a stationary front across the northern Gulf of Mexico
while a tropical low lingers into the southern Gulf.  Another
surge of arctic air appears in store for the northern Plains
through midweek behind the clipper systems.  The eastern and
southern U.S. will be much warmer than normal at the start of the
medium-range period but progressively cooler air will work its way
across these areas through midweek.

The central and southern Rockies into the nearby High Plains will
begin the medium-range period with the passage of the upper low
interacting with an arctic front.  The snow will gradually taper
off early next week as the upper trough exits the region.  The
focus of mountain snow will then shift northward across the
northern Rockies and the foothills by Tuesday through midweek as
the next surge of arctic air arrives from Canada.  For the rest of
the western U.S., dry and near normal temperatures are expected to
return behind the exiting upper trough.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance appears in reasonably good agreement with one
another in predicting the synoptic pattern evolution across the
U.S. through the medium-range period.  The GFS, especially the 18Z
run, was among the slowest guidance in placing the low pressure
center of the ongoing winter storm moving across the upper
Midwest/upper Great Lakes as medium-range starts Sunday morning.
The timing of the elongated low pressure system in its wake also
presented some more issues for the GFS with the 18Z run being much
slower than its ensemble mean as well as the ECMWF/EC mean.  By
midweek next week, the largest model spread appears to be across
the Northeast into eastern Canada where the timing of the various
clipper systems and their potential interactions presented a
challenge.

The WPC medium-range package was derived based on a multi-model
consensus with 40% from the 12Z ECMWF/EC mean, 40% 18Z+00Z GFS/18Z
GEFS, and 20% from the 12Z CMC/CMC mean.  Excellent WPC continuity
was maintained.

0156 AM CST Thu Mar 03 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will gradually breakdown across the
Intermountain West, as increasing cyclonic flow overspreads the
western CONUS ahead of an approaching large-scale trough. Farther
east, a belt of strong flow aloft within the base of a midlevel
trough will move eastward across the northeastern states. At the
surface, lee troughing and a weak surface low will develop over
portions of the High Plains, while a cold front moves eastward off
the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast coast.

...Southern High Plains...
In response to the lee troughing and weak surface low development
over southeastern CO, southerly surface winds will strengthen
across the southern High Plains during the afternoon. Here, a very
dry antecedent airmass is in place, with current surface
observations (as of 12AM CT) showing RH in the lower teens to lower
20s. During the afternoon hours, RH will fall into the 5-15 percent
range amid 15-20 mph sustained southerly surface winds. This will
result in widespread high-end elevated conditions, exacerbated by
very dry fuels. Spotty critical conditions are also expected across
portions of southeastern CO and far northeastern NM, however,
confidence in any more that spotty critical conditions is too
limited for Critical highlights.

...Southwest...
Ahead of the approaching large-scale trough, breezy southerly
surface winds will overlap critically low RH during the afternoon
and early evening, though these conditions appear too marginal for
this area to introduce highlights at this time.

...Mid-Atlantic and Southeast...
A dry post-frontal airmass will be in place across the Mid-Atlantic
and Southeast, where minimum RH of 20-30 percent will develop during
the afternoon. Across the Southeast, sustained westerly surface
winds of 10 mph or less should generally temper the fire-weather
threat. For the Mid-Atlantic, sustained northwesterly surface winds
of 10-15 mph could overlap 25-30 percent RH over parts of NJ, MD,
and DE. With that said, the localized nature of these conditions
casts uncertainty on the fire-weather threat -- precluding Elevated
highlights at this time.

...A dynamic system will produce snow and freezing rain over parts
of the Northern/Central Plains and Upper Midwest this weekend...

...Above normal temperatures continue from the Great Basin to the
Southeast, with fire weather conditions worsening in the High
Plains...

...Cooler temperatures, lower elevation rain, and mountain snow
move into California, the Southwest, and Great Basin tonight...

Temperatures will be below average today across the northern tier
states, on the backside of a cold front and approaching area of
high pressure. Highs will be in the teens and 20s for parts of the
Northern Plains and interior Northeast. A Pacific system, that
brought localized heavy rainfall to portions of the Pacific
Northwest over the past few days, will move south and east over
the next couple of days. This system will spread low elevation
rain and mountain snow across portions of California and the Great
Basin. The Sierra may accumulate between 1-2 feet by Saturday
morning. A cool Pacific airmass will move ashore across the West
Coast and expand across the region beginning Friday. Snow will
pickup intensity across the Rockies on Saturday before spreading
into the Front Range, Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Snow will
remain modest for the Plains and Upper Midwest, with totals likely
to range between 3-6 inches on Saturday. Parts of northern
Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula may experience moderate
to significant freezing rain as well.

Prior to the arrival of the Pacific system later today,
temperatures will be above average for much of the Rockies and
Great Plains. Elevated to Critical fire weather are a concern for
parts of the Southern Plains, along the Texas-

Kebede

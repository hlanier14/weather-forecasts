...Strong and gusty winds across the northern Plains will
gradually moderate as deep storm in southern Canada weakens and
moves away...

...A cold front will bring a around of rain through the eastern
U.S. for the next couple of days followed by colder temperatures
and lake-effect snow/rain over the Great Lakes...

...Tropical moisture will bring some enhanced rainfall across
southern Florida on Thursday...

A deep low pressure system moving across southern Canada will
gradually weaken as it heads towards eastern Canada during the
next couple of days.  Strong and gusty winds across the northern
Plains will gradually moderate today and should have largely
subsided by Thursday as a high pressure ridge takes over.
Meanwhile, mild air across the Deep South through the Ohio Valley
will be pushed into the eastern U.S. and up through New England
following the passage of a warm front.  High temperatures for
today and Thursday will be locally as much as 20 degrees above
normal in portions of the eastern U.S.  A cold front will then
push steadily across the mid-section of the country today, through
the eastern U.S. on Thursday, and then off into the Atlantic by
Friday morning.  Increasing southerly flow ahead of this front
will allow moisture to return north from the Gulf of Mexico and
this will allow for an axis of showers and some thunderstorms to
develop.  Cold air behind the front will set up some lake-effect
rain and snow showers over the Great Lakes region Thursday night
into Friday morning with gusty winds.  Interior New England may
see the rain ending as wet snow following the cold frontal passage
Thursday evening along with gusty winds and colder temperatures.

Meanwhile, a new storm system will be approaching the Pacific
Northwest by late Thursday, and this will bring a new threat of
rain and higher elevation snowfall here as moisture streams
inland.  Some heavy rain will once again be in the forecast for
the Pacific Northwest coast Thursday night.  Some high-elevation
snows should also move into the northern Rockies by Friday morning.

Elsewhere, tropical moisture from the western Caribbean Sea will
be lifted northward ahead of a weak upper-level trough moving into
the Gulf of Mexico.  Some enhanced rainfall can be expected to
move across southern Florida mainly on Thursday.  By Friday
morning, much of the rain should be on its way eastward into the
Atlantic as a cold front dips into northern Florida.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall together with severe thunderstorms
likely across the Deep South through early Wednesday...

...Snow expected across portions of the central High Plains
through Tuesday morning; mixed precipitation expected to develop
over the upper Midwest to upper Great Lakes on Tuesday and linger
into Wednesday...

...Critical risk of fire weather across southwestern Texas through
tonight...

A low pressure system currently developing over the southern
Plains is expected to bring widespread inclement weather across
the mid-section of the country through Tuesday before spreading
into the eastern U.S. on Wednesday.  A deep and broad surge of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will interact will strong
dynamics ahead of a cold front to trigger heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms starting from eastern Texas later tonight/early
Tuesday and will spread steadily eastward through the Deep South
and into the Tennessee Valley through Tuesday night.  Rainfall
totals of around 2-3", with locally higher amounts, are forecast
in these areas with the potential for numerous and significant
flash flooding.  WPC has highlighted the interior portion of the
Deep South within a moderate risk for excessive rainfall.
Meanwhile, SPC continues to highlight an enhanced to moderate risk
for severe weather across roughly the same region, where
widespread severe storms are capable of producing strong
tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.

On the cold side of the system, an area of snow is expanding
across the central High Plains behind a reinforcing surge of
colder air coming from the north.  The snow should spread eastward
into tonight resulting in locally 6 inches of accumulation
possible across western Kansas before tapering off later tonight.
As the low pressure system develops further and tracks toward the
Great Lakes, mixed precipitation is expected to develop over the
upper Midwest and into the upper Great Lakes on Tuesday.  The
wintry weather will likely linger in these areas on Wednesday as
the low pressure system slows down and gradually weakens. Rain is
also likely farther south across the Midwest and the Ohio Valley
Tuesday into Wednesday. Meanwhile, moisture ahead of the cold
front should be not as vigorous as the rain pushes into the
Southeast and the Appalachians by Wednesday morning but pockets of
heavy rain are still possible.  By Wednesday afternoon, the rain
should make its way into the interior Mid-Atlantic region.

As the storm intensifies over the southern Plains tonight, gusty
winds and dry conditions behind the cold front will create a
favorable environment for fire weather concerns across
southwestern Texas.

Elsewhere, a system approaching the Pacific Northwest U.S. bring
rain and mountain snow into the region, with much of the Western
U.S. drying out and warming up after Monday as a strong upper
ridge builds in across the region. Temperatures by Tuesday could
be 10 to 20 degrees above normal for parts of California and
western Oregon, with record highs possible for parts of southwest
California and the northern interior valley.

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 24 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 28 2022

...Overview...

Expect an amplified upper level pattern from late this week into
early next week, with some degree of progression. An eastern
Pacific trough should move into the West by around next Monday
while the mean ridge persisting over the West into the weekend
pushes into the central U.S. This gradual shift in the pattern
will eventually bring some moisture into the West and moderation
of potential record warmth over California and the Great
Basin/Southwest. Meanwhile the elongated upper low/trough over the
east-central U.S. as of early Thursday and the associated
precipitation will lift away fairly quickly but upstream
shortwaves will reinforce a fairly deep mean trough over the East,
producing chilly temperatures along with one or more episodes of
mostly light rain/snow over the northern half of the region.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest cycle of guidance shows decent agreement with the large
scale pattern but there are persistent detail uncertainties. For
the system over the East as of early Thursday, consensus shows a
triple point wave over the Mid-Atlantic becoming the more dominant
feature Friday-Saturday as it tracks over/near New England and
into the Canadian Maritimes. Track differences are generally
within typical spread for a few days out in time. Into Saturday, a
faster trend in the 12Z CMC versus its questionably slow 00Z
version has improved clustering for the shortwave initially
rounding the western ridge and then digging into the eastern mean
trough. Thus far there is not much of a signal for flow to
separate within the trough as depicted in the new 12Z UKMET by
early Sunday. The reinforcing trough energy should support
offshore low pressure by early Sunday, most likely off the
Northeast and then tracking into/near the Canadian Maritimes per
the model and ensemble majority.

At least before today's 12Z cycle, over the past couple days the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean have generally been more consistent than the
GFS/GEFS with the handling of the eastern Pacific upper trough
moving into the West. The main adjustment in the ECMWF/ECMWF mean
has been a slightly faster trend. On the other hand GFS runs have
varied considerably for the handling of individual components of
the overall trough and upstream flow. 12Z/20 through 00Z/21 runs
were quick to separate flow within the trough, leading to an upper
low hanging back well offshore into early next week. More recent
06Z/12Z runs have adjusted faster and better fit within the
ECMWF-ECens/CMC-CMCens cluster. However the 06Z GFS differed from
most solutions in bringing enough southern stream energy into the
Plains late in the period to raise eastern U.S. heights more than
consensus (00Z and new 12Z runs appeared more reasonable). The
GEFS mean has trended a bit slower over the past day. Individual
ensemble member spread becomes very broad late in the period so
confidence in any particular solution is only moderate at best,
and now the 12Z ECMWF's change to more flow separation and slower
upper low further highlight the uncertainty here.

Review of 00Z/06Z guidance led to using the 06Z GFS/ECMWF and
lesser weight of the 00Z UKMET/CMC for the first half of the
forecast, and downplaying the slow CMC for the reinforcing eastern
U.S. trough. The rest of the period transitioned to a model/mean
blend and eventually split GFS input among the 00Z/06Z runs as one
run or the other had more or less appealing traits depending on
the region. The end result provided good continuity in principle.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An occluded low pressure system will be in place over the Upper
Great Lakes early Thursday, with lingering light precipitation
there but with heavier amounts possible along its associated cold
front near the East Coast. Expect mainly rain but snow will be
possible over northern New England, and the snow could linger into
Friday over Maine near a developing coastal low. Shortwave energy
and weak low pressure/frontal systems could lead to light
precipitation spreading from the northern Rockies/Plains Thursday
into the Great Lakes region to the central/northern Appalachians
and Northeast late week into the weekend. Some of this
precipitation may be in the form of snow over higher
elevations/northern latitudes. The central/eastern U.S. evolution
may lead to a period of brisk to strong winds from the northern
Plains late this week into the East during the weekend.
Precipitation ahead of the approaching eastern Pacific upper
trough will likely reach the Pacific Northwest around Friday and
then spread across more of the West thereafter. Most of this
activity should be in the light to moderate range but some locally
heavier totals could be possible depending on exact system
details. Coverage and intensity of this precipitation becomes
increasingly uncertain by late weekend into early next week.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Central Great Basin/Southwest Thursday and Friday, with some plus
20-25F anomalies appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving
to the northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper
ridge axis shifts. Daily record temperatures could be tied or set
across California and eastward. The most likely scenario has an
increasing portion of the West seeing highs closer to normal by
next Monday but there is lower potential that above normal
readings could persist a little longer. Meanwhile, cooler air
underneath the upper trough/low over the central into eastern U.S.
should moderate as it moves eastward, with temperatures generally
10F or less below normal. However, additional cold fronts and
upper energy will bring below normal temperatures to parts of the
eastern third of the U.S. by Sunday, with the Great Lakes and
central Appalachians seeing 10-15F below normal highs.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
415 PM EDT Mon Mar 21 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 24 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 28 2022

...Overview...

Expect an amplified upper level pattern from late this week into
early next week, with some degree of progression. An eastern
Pacific trough should move into the West by around next Monday
while the mean ridge persisting over the West into the weekend
pushes into the central U.S. This gradual shift in the pattern
will eventually bring some moisture into the West and moderation
of potential record warmth over California and the Great
Basin/Southwest. Meanwhile the elongated upper low/trough over the
east-central U.S. as of early Thursday and the associated
precipitation will lift away fairly quickly but upstream
shortwaves will reinforce a fairly deep mean trough over the East,
producing chilly temperatures along with one or more episodes of
mostly light rain/snow over the northern half of the region.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest cycle of guidance shows decent agreement with the large
scale pattern but there are persistent detail uncertainties. For
the system over the East as of early Thursday, consensus shows a
triple point wave over the Mid-Atlantic becoming the more dominant
feature Friday-Saturday as it tracks over/near New England and
into the Canadian Maritimes. Track differences are generally
within typical spread for a few days out in time. Into Saturday, a
faster trend in the 12Z CMC versus its questionably slow 00Z
version has improved clustering for the shortwave initially
rounding the western ridge and then digging into the eastern mean
trough. Thus far there is not much of a signal for flow to
separate within the trough as depicted in the new 12Z UKMET by
early Sunday. The reinforcing trough energy should support
offshore low pressure by early Sunday, most likely off the
Northeast and then tracking into/near the Canadian Maritimes per
the model and ensemble majority.

At least before today's 12Z cycle, over the past couple days the
ECMWF/ECMWF mean have generally been more consistent than the
GFS/GEFS with the handling of the eastern Pacific upper trough
moving into the West. The main adjustment in the ECMWF/ECMWF mean
has been a slightly faster trend. On the other hand GFS runs have
varied considerably for the handling of individual components of
the overall trough and upstream flow. 12Z/20 through 00Z/21 runs
were quick to separate flow within the trough, leading to an upper
low hanging back well offshore into early next week. More recent
06Z/12Z runs have adjusted faster and better fit within the
ECMWF-ECens/CMC-CMCens cluster. However the 06Z GFS differed from
most solutions in bringing enough southern stream energy into the
Plains late in the period to raise eastern U.S. heights more than
consensus (00Z and new 12Z runs appeared more reasonable). The
GEFS mean has trended a bit slower over the past day. Individual
ensemble member spread becomes very broad late in the period so
confidence in any particular solution is only moderate at best,
and now the 12Z ECMWF's change to more flow separation and slower
upper low further highlight the uncertainty here.

Review of 00Z/06Z guidance led to using the 06Z GFS/ECMWF and
lesser weight of the 00Z UKMET/CMC for the first half of the
forecast, and downplaying the slow CMC for the reinforcing eastern
U.S. trough. The rest of the period transitioned to a model/mean
blend and eventually split GFS input among the 00Z/06Z runs as one
run or the other had more or less appealing traits depending on
the region. The end result provided good continuity in principle.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

An occluded low pressure system will be in place over the Upper
Great Lakes early Thursday, with lingering light precipitation
there but with heavier amounts possible along its associated cold
front near the East Coast. Expect mainly rain but snow will be
possible over northern New England, and the snow could linger into
Friday over Maine near a developing coastal low. Shortwave energy
and weak low pressure/frontal systems could lead to light
precipitation spreading from the northern Rockies/Plains Thursday
into the Great Lakes region to the central/northern Appalachians
and Northeast late week into the weekend. Some of this
precipitation may be in the form of snow over higher
elevations/northern latitudes. The central/eastern U.S. evolution
may lead to a period of brisk to strong winds from the northern
Plains late this week into the East during the weekend.
Precipitation ahead of the approaching eastern Pacific upper
trough will likely reach the Pacific Northwest around Friday and
then spread across more of the West thereafter. Most of this
activity should be in the light to moderate range but some locally
heavier totals could be possible depending on exact system
details. Coverage and intensity of this precipitation becomes
increasingly uncertain by late weekend into early next week.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Central Great Basin/Southwest Thursday and Friday, with some plus
20-25F anomalies appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving
to the northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper
ridge axis shifts. Daily record temperatures could be tied or set
across California and eastward. The most likely scenario has an
increasing portion of the West seeing highs closer to normal by
next Monday but there is lower potential that above normal
readings could persist a little longer. Meanwhile, cooler air
underneath the upper trough/low over the central into eastern U.S.
should moderate as it moves eastward, with temperatures generally
10F or less below normal. However, additional cold fronts and
upper energy will bring below normal temperatures to parts of the
eastern third of the U.S. by Sunday, with the Great Lakes and
central Appalachians seeing 10-15F below normal highs.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall together with severe thunderstorms
likely across the Deep South through early Wednesday...

...Snow expected across portions of the central High Plains
through Tuesday morning; mixed precipitation expected to develop
over the upper Midwest to upper Great Lakes on Tuesday and linger
into Wednesday...

...Critical risk of fire weather across southwestern Texas through
tonight...

A low pressure system currently developing over the southern
Plains is expected to bring widespread inclement weather across
the mid-section of the country through Tuesday before spreading
into the eastern U.S. on Wednesday.  A deep and broad surge of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will interact will strong
dynamics ahead of a cold front to trigger heavy rain and strong
thunderstorms starting from eastern Texas later tonight/early
Tuesday and will continue spreading steadily eastward through the
Deep South and into the Tennessee Valley through Tuesday night.
Rainfall totals of around 2-3", with locally higher amounts, are
forecast in these areas with the potential for numerous and
significant flash flooding.  WPC has highlighted the interior
portion of the Deep South within a moderate risk for excessive
rainfall.  Meanwhile, SPC continues to highlight an enhanced to
moderate risk for severe weather across roughly the same region,
where widespread severe storms are capable of producing strong
tornadoes, large hail, and damaging winds.

On the cold side of the system, an area of snow is expanding
across the central High Plains behind a reinforcing surge of
colder air coming from the north.  The snow should spread eastward
into tonight resulting in locally 6 inches of accumulation
possible across western Kansas before tapering off during the day
on Tuesday.  As the low pressure system develops further and
tracks toward the Great Lakes, mixed precipitation is expected to
develop over the upper Midwest and into the upper Great Lakes on
Tuesday.  The wintry weather will likely linger in these areas on
Wednesday as the low pressure system slows down and gradually
weakens.  Rain is also likely farther south across the Midwest and
the Ohio Valley Tuesday into Wednesday. Meanwhile, the moisture
surge ahead of the cold front should become not as vigorous as the
rain pushes into the Southeast and the Appalachians by Wednesday
morning but pockets of heavy rain are still possible.  By
Wednesday afternoon, the rain should make its way into the
interior Mid-Atlantic region.

As the storm intensifies over the southern Plains tonight, gusty
winds and dry conditions behind the cold front will create a
favorable environment for fire weather concerns across
southwestern Texas.

Elsewhere, a frontal system approaching the Pacific Northwest will
bring rain and mountain snow into the region through tonight
before drying out on Tuesday as a strong upper ridge begins to
build along the West Coast.  Temperatures by Tuesday is forecast
to be 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the inland sections of the
West Coast, with record highs possible in parts of California and
the northern interior valley by Tuesday afternoon.  More record
high temperatures are forecast on Wednesday in these areas.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0129 AM CDT Tue Mar 22 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
A long-wave upper trough will progress eastward across the central
U.S. today as a surface low rapidly deepens while tracking northeast
toward the Upper Mississippi Valley. A broad swath of dry
north-northwesterly surface winds will overspread the post-cold
frontal environment from the northern Plains, southward into the
southern High Plains and Desert Southwest, promoting some wildfire
spread potential. Meanwhile, dry offshore flow will also develop
across the northern Mid Atlantic into New England today, posing a
limited risk for localized fire spread amid poorly receptive fuels
on a widespread basis.

...Northern Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, RH is expected to drop to 25 percent as
north-northwesterly surface winds sustain in the 25-30 mph range.
Elevated highlights have been introduced given the presence of dry
fuels. Up to 0.25 inches of precipitation have been observed across
southwest Nebraska. However, the very dry and windy conditions may
compensate to support grass-fire spread.

...Eastern New Mexico into deep-south Texas...
Downslope flow to the lee of the southern Rockies will encourage
20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid 20-25 percent
RH for several hours tomorrow afternoon. While the forecast RH
marginally supports wildfire spread across the southern High Plains,
the very dry fuels and windy conditions warrant the introduction of
Elevated highlights.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO INTO WESTERN TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will meander across the central U.S. while a surface
low gradually drifts into the Great Lakes region tomorrow/Wednesday.
With surface high pressure building into the central Rockies,
gradient-induced northwesterly winds will persist across the Plains
states, with wildfire-spread concerns developing in areas of drier
air, especially across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Downslope flow along the lee of the southern Rockies will support
10-20 percent RH across eastern New Mexico into western Texas, along
with widespread 20+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
Wednesday afternoon. Critical highlights have been introduced where
the guidance consensus depicts the longest-lasting favorable wind/RH
overlap, and where forecast fuel ERCs reach the 90th percentile on
at least a spotty basis.

...Northern High Plains...
Similar to Day 1, 20-30 mph sustained north-northwesterly winds will
persist through Wednesday. While temperatures are expected to be
cool overall, the latest guidance consensus suggests that RH may
drop as low as 20 percent in spots. Given the presence of a moderate
to severe drought and at least modestly dry fuels in place, Elevated
highlights have been introduced.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Tue Mar 22 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 25 2022 - 12Z Tue Mar 29 2022

...Overview...

An amplified upper level pattern is expected during the medium
range period, beginning Friday with troughing across the East and
ridging in the West. Additional impulses coming into the trough
will reinforce it at least for the northeastern U.S. through early
next week, with cool temperatures and periodic light
precipitation. Meanwhile the ridge should be gradually pushed
toward the central U.S., spreading warmer temperatures there after
potentially record-setting warmth in the West, as troughing
approaches from the East Pacific. There is uncertainty in the
trough's timing and amplitude, but it should cause increased
precipitation chances and cooler temperatures in the West when it
comes in, with potential for a surface low pressure system to
strengthen in the Plains but the end of the period next Tuesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 12/18Z yesterday cycle begins with
generally good agreement for the large scale pattern, with typical
differences with shortwaves embedded within the trough over the
eastern third of the country. An initial coastal low just off New
England early Friday clusters well among guidance. Models show
stronger energy with the possibility of a small closed upper low
early Saturday likely over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, but with
some latitudinal variations in how far south the trough/low
reaches--ECMWF runs have generally been among the farthest south.
But the bigger outlier with this feature was likely the 12Z UKMET,
which separated streams by Sunday to create a southern stream low
in the Southeast, so leaned away from that solution. There is
generally good agreement in principle that troughing will lift
gradually early in the workweek for the Southeast, but with some
semblance remaining in the Northeast.

However, farther west, more significant differences in the pattern
arise. While early agreement for ridging shifting eastward is
reasonably good, there are notable timing issues with individual
models as well as ensemble means with the incoming troughing, as
well as differences in potential stream separation and its timing.
The 12Z and newer 00Z ECMWF show a much slower closed low compared
to most of the recent guidance and its ensemble mean, after its
previous runs were among the faster solutions. In contrast, GFS
runs are now faster with an inland track and more phased, after
runs about a day ago showed an upper low hovering in the Pacific
longer. This flip-flop as well as individual ensemble member
spread becoming very broad late in the period leads to fairly low
confidence in the trough's timing. The CMC and its mean are faster
and more clustered with the GFS/GEFS, but did think the 12Z CMC
ensemble mean may be slightly fast with the trough axis by next
Tuesday.

Thus the WPC medium range forecast favored an operational model
blend at the beginning of the period. Lessened the proportion
especially of the ECMWF by the end of the period as better
clustering seemed to be with the ECMWF mean, GFS runs, GEFS means,
and CMC. Given the uncertainty, shifts in the forecast are
possible if not likely particularly with the timing of the trough
and the associated fronts ahead of it.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Snow may linger in Maine on Friday as a coastal low forms. Then
shortwave energy and weak low pressure/frontal systems could lead
to light precipitation spreading across the northeastern quadrant
of the country through early next week, from the Great Lakes
region to the central/northern Appalachians and Northeast late
week into the weekend. Some of this precipitation will be in the
form of snow in higher elevations and northern latitudes, and
gusty winds are also possible. Precipitation ahead of the
approaching eastern Pacific upper trough is likely to reach the
Pacific Northwest around Friday and then spread across more of the
West thereafter. Most of this activity should be in the light to
moderate range but some locally heavier totals could be possible
depending on exact system details. Coverage and intensity of this
precipitation becomes increasingly uncertain by late weekend into
early next week.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday, with some plus 20-25F anomalies
appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving to the
northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper ridge
axis shifts. Daily record temperatures could be tied or set across
California and eastward. Temperatures in the West are likely to
cool closer to normal by around Monday but the exact timing will
depend on the trough's movement inland. Meanwhile the East should
see near to slightly below average temperatures given mean upper
troughing, with coolest temperatures of 10-15F below normal in the
central Appalachians for the weekend and in the Great Lakes early
next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Tue Mar 22 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 25 2022 - 12Z Tue Mar 29 2022

...Overview...

An amplified upper level pattern is expected during the medium
range period, beginning Friday with troughing across the East and
ridging in the West. Additional impulses coming into the trough
will reinforce it at least for the northeastern U.S. through early
next week, with cool temperatures and periodic light
precipitation. Meanwhile the ridge should be gradually pushed
toward the central U.S., spreading warmer temperatures there after
potentially record-setting warmth in the West, as troughing
approaches from the East Pacific. There is uncertainty in the
trough's timing and amplitude, but it should cause increased
precipitation chances and cooler temperatures in the West when it
comes in, with potential for a surface low pressure system to
strengthen in the Plains but the end of the period next Tuesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance from the 12/18Z yesterday cycle begins with
generally good agreement for the large scale pattern, with typical
differences with shortwaves embedded within the trough over the
eastern third of the country. An initial coastal low just off New
England early Friday clusters well among guidance. Models show
stronger energy with the possibility of a small closed upper low
early Saturday likely over the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, but with
some latitudinal variations in how far south the trough/low
reaches--ECMWF runs have generally been among the farthest south.
But the bigger outlier with this feature was likely the 12Z UKMET,
which separated streams by Sunday to create a southern stream low
in the Southeast, so leaned away from that solution. There is
generally good agreement in principle that troughing will lift
gradually early in the workweek for the Southeast, but with some
semblance remaining in the Northeast.

However, farther west, more significant differences in the pattern
arise. While early agreement for ridging shifting eastward is
reasonably good, there are notable timing issues with individual
models as well as ensemble means with the incoming troughing, as
well as differences in potential stream separation and its timing.
The 12Z and newer 00Z ECMWF show a much slower closed low compared
to most of the recent guidance and its ensemble mean, after its
previous runs were among the faster solutions. In contrast, GFS
runs are now faster with an inland track and more phased, after
runs about a day ago showed an upper low hovering in the Pacific
longer. This flip-flop as well as individual ensemble member
spread becoming very broad late in the period leads to fairly low
confidence in the trough's timing. The CMC and its mean are faster
and more clustered with the GFS/GEFS, but did think the 12Z CMC
ensemble mean may be slightly fast with the trough axis by next
Tuesday.

Thus the WPC medium range forecast favored an operational model
blend at the beginning of the period. Lessened the proportion
especially of the ECMWF by the end of the period as better
clustering seemed to be with the ECMWF mean, GFS runs, GEFS means,
and CMC. Given the uncertainty, shifts in the forecast are
possible if not likely particularly with the timing of the trough
and the associated fronts ahead of it.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Snow may linger in Maine on Friday as a coastal low forms. Then
shortwave energy and weak low pressure/frontal systems could lead
to light precipitation spreading across the northeastern quadrant
of the country through early next week, from the Great Lakes
region to the central/northern Appalachians and Northeast late
week into the weekend. Some of this precipitation will be in the
form of snow in higher elevations and northern latitudes, and
gusty winds are also possible. Precipitation ahead of the
approaching eastern Pacific upper trough is likely to reach the
Pacific Northwest around Friday and then spread across more of the
West thereafter. Most of this activity should be in the light to
moderate range but some locally heavier totals could be possible
depending on exact system details. Coverage and intensity of this
precipitation becomes increasingly uncertain by late weekend into
early next week.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday, with some plus 20-25F anomalies
appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving to the
northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper ridge
axis shifts. Daily record temperatures could be tied or set across
California and eastward. Temperatures in the West are likely to
cool closer to normal by around Monday but the exact timing will
depend on the trough's movement inland. Meanwhile the East should
see near to slightly below average temperatures given mean upper
troughing, with coolest temperatures of 10-15F below normal in the
central Appalachians for the weekend and in the Great Lakes early
next week.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall together with severe thunderstorms
likely across the Deep South Tuesday with a lessening threat into
the Southeast on Wednesday...

...Some wintry weather possible across the northern Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday...

...Record heat for parts of California mid-week, with a critical
fire weather threat across the southern High Plains...


A robust spring storm currently in the southern Plains will
continue the threat for unsettled weather across the central U.S.
and Midwest on Tuesday, and into the East by Wednesday. A deep
surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico interacting with
favorable dynamics both at the surface and aloft helped fuel
widespread heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms across eastern
Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley overnight, which should
steadily press eastward into the central Gulf Coast and Tennessee
Valley states today. Rainfall totals of 3-5 inches, with locally
higher amounts, are forecast in this region through Tuesday night,
contributing to numerous and potentially significant flash
flooding. WPC has highlighted parts of the lower Mississippi
Valley into Mississippi and Alabama within a moderate risk for
excessive rainfall. At the same time, SPC continues to highlight
an enhanced to moderate risk for severe weather across roughly the
same region, with storms capable of producing strong tornadoes,
large hail, and damaging winds.

Rainfall associated with this system will also expand into the
Midwest and middle/upper Mississippi Valley on Tuesday, with some
wintry precipitation possible across far northern regions.
Generally light to moderate snow and freezing rain accumulations
are possible into Wednesday across northern Minnesota and the
northern Great Lakes. The storm system will move into the Eastern
U.S. on Wednesday, although impacts are expected to be less
widespread and less intense. Even so, WPC still shows a slight
risk for flash flooding across the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday,
with SPC highlighting a slight risk for severe weather up into the
Southeast. This system should exit the East Coast on Thursday,
with some lingering heavy coastal rain and light snow across New
England. A cold air mass for this time of the year should filter
in behind this system, with much below normal temperatures across
the southern Rockies and High Plains on Tuesday, moving into the
Mississippi Valley and the Midwest Wednesday and Thursday.

Elsewhere, gusty winds and dry conditions across the southern High
Plains should lead to another day of elevated to critical fire
weather threats on Wednesday. A front into the Northwest, will
spread light rain and mountain snows across the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies on Tuesday. A ridge building across the
Western U.S. during mid week will bring well above normal
temperatures to much of the West with daytime highs running 10 to
20 degrees, or more, in some places. Record highs are possible in
parts of mainly the interior valley of California through at least
Thursday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1038 AM CST Sat Mar 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO TEXAS
SOUTH PLAINS...

The forecast for the southern High Plains remains unchanged. There
is some uncertainty as to the eastern extent of critical fire
weather risk into the Texas South Plains. With isolated thunderstorm
activity possible along the dryline this afternoon near the NM
border, the duration of critical conditions could be shortened from
what is expected.

Overnight RH recovery in parts of the Mid-Atlantic and southern New
England has been poor. Current observations show low 20s to mid 30s
RH from the Delmarva into CT/MA. However, the surface gradient will
weaken during the day and temperatures will cool in most locations.
Elevated conditions remain possible on a local basis, however.

The previous discussion follow with further details.

..Wendt.. 03/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Sat Mar 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low over the Four Corners will translate eastward today
supporting lee cyclogensis across the central High Plains.
Northwesterly flow aloft and surface high pressure will support cool
and dry conditions across much of the Northeast. Critical fire
weather conditions are expected across portions of the southern High
Plains, with locally elevated fire weather potential possible across
New England.

...Southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected to the west of a well
developed dryline forecast to stall across the central Texas
Panhandle. Surface flow will increase to 25-40 mph with higher gusts
owing to deep vertical mixing and a strong mid-level jet streak over
the Four Corners. The deep mixing and warm temperatures will support
RH in the single digits to low teens across much of eastern New
Mexico. Dry fuels in the presence of the well mixed/windy boundary
layer in regional model soundings suggests critical fire weather
conditions are very likely through the afternoon and evening hours.


Across northeastern New Mexico, wrap-around moisture behind the
departing lee low will support the development of
showers/thunderstorms this morning through the early afternoon.
Precipitation that develops will limit the potential for fire
weather conditions this afternoon. However, rapid drying of the
boundary-layer and very strong surface winds behind the low may
support locally elevated fire weather conditions late this afternoon
and evening.

...Northeast...
Behind a cold front, dry surface conditions are expected across New
England and portions of the Mid-Atlantic with surface RH of 20-30%.
Surface winds will likely remain below critical thresholds given
increasing high pressure across the Ohio valley. However, the
presence of dry fuels and very dry surface condition suggests
locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions may develop
despite weaker winds and cool temperatures.

...Bouts of heavy rainfall possible across the southeastern
quadrant of the CONUS next week...

...Overview...

A robust, upper low will track east from the Four Corners region
through the extended period; which will keep the potential for
widespread rainfall with embedded areas of locally heavy amounts
across the South and into the Tennessee Valley. Multiple weakening
low pressure systems will approach the West, keeping a majority of
the precipitation in British Columbia. Prior to the passage of the
cold front, most of the CONUS will experience near seasonal
average for mid-March.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 6Z and 12Z model guidance was fairly clustered with respect to
the deep mid/upper low exiting the Four Corners region into the
central US. The GFS was more open and faster than the ECWMF, CMC
and UKMET solutions to track the front through the Plains-
especially in the initial and middle periods. Preferred a heavier
weighting to non-NCEP guidance for this issuance. The blend mainly
was nearly equal parts of the ECWMF/CMC/UKMET with light weighting
of the 00Z/06Z runs of the GFS increasing inclusion of the EC
ensemble means and the GEFS means by mid and late periods as there
is timing uncertainty as the low/front tracks through the eastern
U.S. and offshore.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The leading system will spread light to modest rain/snow over the
Central Rockies and into the adjacent Plains Tuesday while the
rainfall increases areal coverage over the Southeast along the
warm front. Areas north of the frontal boundary will have light
snow from the Corn Belt to points east into the higher terrain of
the Central Appalachians, spreading to the Northeast toward the
end of the forecast period. Rainfall could be heavy in some
locations in the warm air mass near and inland from the Gulf Coast
Tuesday through Thursday. Farther west, approaching Pacific system
will spread low elevation rain and higher elevation snow to the
West Coast (NorCal and northern Sierra into coastal OR/WA)
especially Wednesday onward.

The Southeast will have mild temperatures through Wednesday with
numerous locations in the 70s. Meanwhile, colder than average
temperatures will be ushered in by the cold front exiting the
Rockies. The daily high temperatures will average 5 to 15 degrees
colder across most of the the Interior West and into the High
Plains toward the end of the extended period. With ridging
expected to build back into the West, warmer temperatures will
slowly return.

...Bouts of heavy rainfall possible across the southeastern
quadrant of the CONUS next week...

...Overview...

A robust, upper low will track east from the Four Corners region
through the extended period; which will keep the potential for
widespread rainfall with embedded areas of locally heavy amounts
across the South and into the Tennessee Valley. Multiple weakening
low pressure systems will approach the West, keeping a majority of
the precipitation in British Columbia. Prior to the passage of the
cold front, most of the CONUS will experience near seasonal
average for mid-March.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 6Z and 12Z model guidance was fairly clustered with respect to
the deep mid/upper low exiting the Four Corners region into the
central US. The GFS was more open and faster than the ECWMF, CMC
and UKMET solutions to track the front through the Plains-
especially in the initial and middle periods. Preferred a heavier
weighting to non-NCEP guidance for this issuance. The blend mainly
was nearly equal parts of the ECWMF/CMC/UKMET with light weighting
of the 00Z/06Z runs of the GFS increasing inclusion of the EC
ensemble means and the GEFS means by mid and late periods as there
is timing uncertainty as the low/front tracks through the eastern
U.S. and offshore.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The leading system will spread light to modest rain/snow over the
Central Rockies and into the adjacent Plains Tuesday while the
rainfall increases areal coverage over the Southeast along the
warm front. Areas north of the frontal boundary will have light
snow from the Corn Belt to points east into the higher terrain of
the Central Appalachians, spreading to the Northeast toward the
end of the forecast period. Rainfall could be heavy in some
locations in the warm air mass near and inland from the Gulf Coast
Tuesday through Thursday. Farther west, approaching Pacific system
will spread low elevation rain and higher elevation snow to the
West Coast (NorCal and northern Sierra into coastal OR/WA)
especially Wednesday onward.

The Southeast will have mild temperatures through Wednesday with
numerous locations in the 70s. Meanwhile, colder than average
temperatures will be ushered in by the cold front exiting the
Rockies. The daily high temperatures will average 5 to 15 degrees
colder across most of the the Interior West and into the High
Plains toward the end of the extended period. With ridging
expected to build back into the West, warmer temperatures will
slowly return.

...Major winter storm will bring heavy snow and blizzard
conditions to parts of the Central Rockies and central High Plains
through early Monday...

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding over portions of the
Central/Southern Plains this weekend will move into the
mid-Mississippi Valley on Monday...

...Critical fire danger for parts of New Mexico and western
Texas...

A low pressure system will bring multiple forms of hazardous
weather across the central portion of the country through the
weekend as a cold upper-level low exiting the Southwest interacts
with a boundary across the Central Plains. The stationary front,
which has since turned warm as it begins its ascend through the
Southern Plains, will be the focus for bouts of severe
thunderstorm activity together with locally heavy rain across the
Central/Southern Plains. The intensifying storm will ingest
additional Gulf moisture and dump heavy rain across the Central
Plains and Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley tonight. Heavy snow and
blizzard conditions are expected to spread across Colorado and
Wyoming through Sunday. The storm should reach peak intensity on
Sunday, bringing snowfall amounts of possibly 4 feet for the
highest elevations while one to two feet could be quite common
across the nearby central High Plains. Widespread travel impacts
are likely as strong winds combined with snowfall rates of one to
two inches per hour may produce blizzard conditions for some
areas. Blizzard Warnings, Winter Storm Advisories and Warnings
have been issued for much the Central Rockies to the central High
Plains to the Black Hills of South Dakota. At the same time,
strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast to move across the
Southern Plains ahead of a strong cold front associated with the
intensifying low pressure system, reaching into the Middle
Mississippi Valley by Monday. In addition, dry and strong
downslope winds to the south of the storm are expected to promote
elevated to critical fire danger across parts of the southern High
Plains through Sunday.

Outside of the major storm system, some light wintry precipitation
is expected over interior New England on Sunday as reinforcing
shots of colder air move in from Canada. In contrast, much above
normal temperatures are forecast to return for the Northern Plains
to the Upper Midwest. Out West, an active cold front from the
eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round of unsettled
weather into much of the West Coast beginning on Sunday.  The
Sierra Nevada could see heavy snow impacting the region Sunday
night into Monday, as rain spreads into the lower elevations of
northern and central California.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0158 PM CST Sat Mar 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TRANS-PECOS INTO SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...

Some modification to the ongoing critical area has been made. Given
less receptive fuels from the Big Bend eastward, the area has been
trimmed westward. Locally elevated conditions will be possible as
far east as the I-35 corridor in central Texas, however. Some
modifications to the elevated could become necessary based on
rainfall this afternoon and evening in parts of the Texas South
Plains.

For the Mid-Atlantic, given the trends in afternoon RH observations,
the elevated has been expanded to the south. The very dry conditions
the last two days should increase the amount of available fine
fuels. Locally critical conditions are possible, but cooler
temperatures still appear as though they will limit the duration of
critically low RH.

..Wendt.. 03/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Sat Mar 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper low ejecting eastward across the southern Plains will
stall and become vertically stacked as it slowly begins to fill
through tomorrow evening. Strong mid-level flow along the southern
half of the low will linger above the Southwest and southern High
Plains supporting dry and windy conditions. A shortwave trough
embedded within very strong northwesterly flow over the Northeast
will bringing cool, dry, and windy conditions to the Mid Atlantic.

...Southwest Texas southeast New Mexico...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected through day as strong
westerly flow and dry surface conditions overlap with critically dry
fuels. Model soundings show a deep well-mixed boundary layer with
surface RH of 10-15% in the wake of a deep lee cyclone. A 60-80 kt
mid-level jet streak above the region will bolster surface winds to
25-40 mph with higher gusts through the afternoon and evening.
Despite some light precipitation over the past few days, critical
fire weather conditions will likely develop, given plentiful dry
fuels and the magnitude of dry/windy conditions.

...Northeast...
A post frontal airmass across the Mid-Atlantic may support elevated
to near critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon and
evening. A northwesterly mid-level jet will enhance boundary-layer
mixing in a cold advection regime. Surface winds of 15-25 mph are
likely through the afternoon. With dry northwesterly flow, surface
RH of 30-35% is forecast to develop. While fuels are not overly
supportive and cooling temperatures may hamper the overall threat
somewhat, the degree of dry and windy conditions will support
elevated fire weather potential.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat March 13 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Heavy rainfall possible in the Southeast Wednesday...

...Overview...

Upper ridging in the Bering Sea will promote troughing into the
Gulf of Alaska and northeastern Pacific Ocean, offshore Washington
state, later this week. An upper low in the Plains will move
eastward, carrying a surface cold front to the East Coast by late
Thursday, possibly producing areas of heavier rain. High pressure
will build in behind it from Canada with cooler and drier air. By
next weekend, the Pacific system will likely move ashore with mild
temperatures from the Rockies to the Upper Midwest.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Through the 12Z/18Z guidance, a deterministic/consensus blend
sufficed for the Wed-Thu period as an area of low pressure lifts
out of the Plains and into the mid-Mississippi and Ohio River
valleys. The Canadian and GFS were on the slower and faster side
of the spread, respectively, and were gradually removed from the
blend. The 18Z parallel GFS (V16) was more aligned with the ECMWF
and ensemble consensus. By next weekend, some solutions showed a
lingering upper trough over the Southeast, perhaps spurring
cyclogenesis along the frontal boundary to varying degrees.
Depicted a rather meager area of low pressure that slowly nudges
eastward rather than wraps ups near the coast given the lead time
and dearth of near-shore ensemble members (especially in the GEFS
compared to the ECMWF EPS, which was stronger aloft over the
Southeast).

Over the West, ongoing preference toward the slower end of the
solutions (generally non-GFS) has served well but would still
allow a lead weaker front and then more defined front to come
ashore late Thu and early Sat, respectively. GEFS mean and ECMWF
ensemble mean were in good enough agreement to use as a blend
(with larger differences in the Southeast).

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Rainfall will increase in areal coverage out of the
Plains/mid-Mississippi valley Wednesday into the Southeast along
the warm front. Locally heavier rain is possible along with some
thunderstorms from the ArkLaMiss into the Tennessee valley. Areas
north of the frontal boundary may see some light snow from the
Corn Belt into the higher terrain of the Northeast as the system
pushes offshore. Rainfall may turn to light snow as it ends over
the central Appalachians as colder air filters in from the
northwest. Assuming the front stays offshore next weekend, the
East will be largely precipitation-free.

Approaching Pacific systems will spread low elevation rain and
higher elevation snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern
Sierra into coastal OR/WA) Wednesday-Thursday, with higher amounts
possible from the system next weekend as the upper trough moves in
as well. Light snow could spread into the central and northern
Rockies as the front moves through the Great Basin and over the
Divide.

Mild temperatures over the Southeast Wednesday (widepsread 70s to
near 80 with record highs possible over Florida) will give way to
60s behind the cold front. Temperatures will be about 5 to 10
degrees colder than normal for areas in the East Fri-Sat. With
ridging expected to build out of the Rockies, well above normal
temperatures are expected for the High Plains next weekend
(perhaps 15-20 degrees above normal).

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 AM CST Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND SOUTHWEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low over southern Colorado will move eastward and
become vertically stacked as it slowly starts to fill through today.
A shortwave ridge across the Ohio valley will amplify while a deep
trough and 100 kt mid-level jet moves offshore across the Northeast.
Fire weather conditions will be possible across the Mid-Atlantic and
southern High Plains this afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Westerly winds of 25-35 mph are expected south of the deep upper low
moving across Colorado and Kansas. Dry surface conditions with RH of
10-15% can be expected from the deep vertical mixing and
temperatures in the 60s. With fine fuel dryness above normal,
critical fire weather conditions are expected through the day.
Elevated fire weather conditions may also develop further east into
south central Texas where winds are slightly weaker, but dry
conditions persist.

...Northeast...
A dry post frontal airmass with RH as low as 25% will develop cross
the Mid-Atlantic this afternoon. High pressure over the Ohio valley
in conjunction with a northwesterly mid-level jet will drive
northwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph downslope and offshore
through the day. Despite the cooler temperatures, regional model
soundings show an environment favorable for elevated fire weather
potential through the afternoon.

0142 AM CST Sun Mar 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The deep upper low across the central plains will fill and lift
rapidly to the north ahead of a second strong shortwave trough
moving onshore across southern California. Shortwave ridging will
develop over the Southwest and Northeast temporarily minimizing wind
speeds across the areas of greatest fire weather potential.

...Southern New Mexico...
With the lack of  large scale atmospheric features across the
region, concentrated fire weather potential through Day2/Monday
appears low at this time. However, hi-res guidance has shown dry
surface conditions and near criteria wind developing in the late
afternoon. Thus, locally elevated conditions may develop through the
afternoon hours. Uncertainty remains high, but a small elevated area
may be added in future outlooks should more widespread conditions be
expected to develop.

...Major winter storm is poised to bring heavy snow and blizzard
conditions to parts of the central Rockies to the north-central
High Plains today...

...Severe thunderstorms and heavy rain over portions of the
central and southern Plains today will shift towards the
mid-Mississippi Valley on Monday...

...Critical fire danger continues across parts of New Mexico and
western Texas...

A low pressure system continues to intensify as it expands its
impact with multiple forms of hazardous weather across the central
portion of the country this Sunday morning.  Moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico has been lifted ahead of a dynamic cold front which
continues to trigger frequent bouts of severe thunderstorms across
the southern Plains.  Farther north, heavy rain with embedded
thunderstorms are expanding across the central Plains ahead of a
warm front and the intensifying low pressure system.  Meanwhile, a
major winter storm is currently in progress across the central
Rockies and nearby High Plains on the back side of the storm
system.  The storm should reach peak intensity later today as it
begins to wobble eastward into the central Plains on Monday,
dumping additional heavy rain across the central Plains.
Meanwhile, heavy snow and increasing winds are expected to bring
blizzard conditions are from parts of the central Rockies to the
north-central High Plains today, with additional 2 to 3 feet of
snow possible along the Front Range of Wyoming and Colorado while
one to two feet could be quite common across the nearby High
Plains to southwestern South Dakota.  Blizzard Warnings, Winter
Storm Advisories and Warnings continue to be in effect from the
central Rockies to the north-central High Plains to the Black
Hills of South Dakota.  The low pressure system will begin to
weaken on Monday as it gradually moves eastward.  Strong to severe
thunderstorms are forecast to shift eastward across the southern
Plains today, reaching the Mississippi Valley on Monday before
losing intensity as they reach the interior Southeast early on
Tuesday.  As the weakening storm pulls eastward, there will likely
be a swath of freezing rain and mixed precipitation moving through
parts of the Midwest and Ohio Valley, reaching the central
Applachians Tuesday morning. In addition, dry and strong downslope
winds to the south of the storm are expected to promote elevated
to critical fire danger across parts of the southern High Plains
through Sunday.

Outside of the major storm system, some light wintry precipitation
is expected over interior New England on Sunday as reinforcing
shots of colder air move in from Canada. In contrast, much above
normal temperatures are forecast to return for the Northern Plains
to the Upper Midwest. Out West, an active cold front from the
eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round of unsettled
weather into much of the West Coast beginning on Sunday.  The
Sierra Nevada could see heavy snow impacting the region Sunday
night into Monday, as rain spreads into the lower elevations of
northern and central California.

normal temperatures are forecast for the Deep South ahead of the
strong cold front.  Out West, an active cold front from the
eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round of unsettled
weather into much of the West Coast today.  The Sierra Nevada
should see heavy snow impacting the region tonight into Monday, as
rain spreads into the lower elevations of northern and central
California.  The system will then bring mountain snows across the
Great Basin and northern Arizona as well as the northern Rockies
Monday night when colder air settles from west to east across the
western U.S.  By early on Tuesday, much of the Four-Corners region
should see snow arriving while a low pressure system begins to
take shape in the vicinity.

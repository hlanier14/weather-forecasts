...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the Four Corners late this
week into the Plains early next week, separating mean troughing in
the East and the eastern Pacific into the West. A series of fronts
coming into the Northwest will keep precipitation chances high
there, while a front and developing low pressure system off the
East Coast will spread some rain across Florida and up the
Southeast coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models continue to show good agreement in a quick moving shortwave
across the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast and also a southern
stream shortwave through the Southeast on Friday. Uncertainty in
the southeast system increases by the weekend though as models
suggest amplification of the shortwave spinning up a surface low
off the Southeast Coast. The 00z CMC/UKMET are both
stronger/slower with the system as it lifts through the Western
Atlantic early next week. The 06z GFS is ok early on, but by early
next week it may be too quick/weak to eject the system eastward.
WPC favored a blend towards the 00z ECMWF and ensemble means for
this system which also maintains good continuity with the previous
shift.

A persistent train of shortwaves coming into the Pacific Northwest
shows considerable variability as they track across the northern
U.S. and southern Canada this weekend into early next week. Again,
the 06z GFS becomes probablematic as its quicker to break down the
ridge and much faster with one shortwave Sun-Tues. The next system
drops in from Alaska early next week and the GFS is considerably
stronger and farther south with this system next Mon-Tues, but
does have some support from the 00z CMC as well. Run to run
varibility with the deterministic solutions and spread in the
enesmbles suggest enough uncertainty that sticking closer to the
ensemble means is best at this time.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A front over the western Atlantic, Florida peninsula, and the Gulf
of Mexico and a developing surface low along it will cause
rainfall over much of Florida on Friday as ample moisture streams
in. As the low tracks northeastward into the western Atlantic,
some rain is expected on the backside for the coastal Carolinas
and possibly into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday
into Saturday, but how far west precipitation reaches will depend
on the surface low track in the western Atlantic. Current
forecasts do not show rainfall reaching very far inland, given a
more offshore track of the low.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into
early next week near the West Coast. Through the period, the
Pacific Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with amounts there
increasing by next Monday into Tuesday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the Gulf, a cold surface high
pressure system will maintain below normal temperatures across the
southeastern CONUS through the weekend, with highs 10-15F below
average and highs/lows 5-10F below normal farther west and north
into southern portions of the Mississippi Valley and the Ohio
Valley. Some of these regions could see overnight temperatures dip
into the mid to low 30s which could result in the first frost of
the season for some places. Meanwhile, a more persistent
upper-level ridge indicated with this forecast cycle over the
west-central U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above
average by 10-20 degrees over the Plains and stretching into the
Midwest. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat
below normal over the West Coast on most days.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT November 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, surface high pressure favored over the Southeast
could allow for temperatures at or below freezing before the system quickly
moves offshore later in the period. Farther west, , a potent surface storm =
is
expected to move northward through the middle of the CONUS and into Canada,
bringing a chance for heavy precipitation for a broad area from the interio=
r
Southeast and lower Mississippi Valley northward through the upper Midwest.
The
resulting strong surface pressure gradient between this storm and the surfa=
ce
high pressure off the Atlantic Coast increases chances  for unusually stron=
g
winds along and east of the storm track, from the southeastern Great Plains
into the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. To the west of the stor=
m
system, northerly winds could bring unusually cold air into parts of the
southern High Plains. Meanwhile, one or more moderate to strong Pacific sto=
rms
forecast early in the period, enhances chances for heavy precipitation west=
 of
the Cascades, with strong winds along parts of Oregon and adjacent Washingt=
on
coastline.. Surface high pressure centered over the Great Basin during the
first half of week-2 introduces the potential for strong downsloping Santa =
Ana
over southern California. In Alaska, very cold air could settle into the
interior northeastern part of the state during the middle of week-2, with
temperatures potentially reaching as low as -40 deg F.

FOR WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 10 - TUESDAY NOVEMBER 16: There is good model agreem=
ent
favoring high surface pressure over the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic Reforeca=
st
tools continue to support a slight risk of much below normal temperatures o=
ver
the region for day 8 (Nov 10), as anomalously cold temperatures are expecte=
d
to
quickly moderate, with this surface high favored to   shift offshore, creat=
ing
southerly surface winds that should quickly bring in milder air. Relative t=
o
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs solutions bring a much stronger ridge than
yesterday into the interior western CONUS, weaker mid-level troughing
(resulting in any associated surface storms tracking farther to the northwe=
st
in the Pacific Ocean and western CONUS), and subnormal 500-hPa heights
extending farther northwest in the eastern CONUS. The northward shift and
weakening height trend keeps the risk of heavy precipitation farther north,
across the Pacific Northwest relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs guidance, and also
increases the chances for strong downsloping Santa Ana winds during the fir=
st
half of week-2 across the southern California coastline,. Additionally,
enhanced chances for high winds remain favored along the Oregon and adjacen=
t
Washington coast, where the surface pressure gradient between the Great Bas=
in
high pressure center and the low pressure systems west of British Columbia
look
to be the strongest.



Models also generally agree that a potentially potent storm system will tra=
ck
northward through the central CONUS. There is better agreement in the model
guidance than yesterday regarding this feature, and also appears to  be mor=
e
pronounced in the latest model runs. The potent surface storm results in
enhanced chances for a variety of hazards through the middle portion of
week-2,
including a swath of heavy precipitation along the storm track running
north-south through the central CONUS, strong southerly winds along and to =
the
east of the storm track, and much below normal temperatures in the wake of =
the
storm across the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains.



In Alaska, model consensus isn=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt as robust, but t=
he trough extending
north-south through the state and into the Pacific Ocean could allow very c=
old
air to settle into parts of northeastern and east-central Alaska. But there
are
model inconsistencies regarding how cold temperatures will get, and how lon=
g
the cold air will remain in the region, thereby reducing confidence despite
some models advertising an extremely cold solution.



Toward the end of week-2, nearly all models show weaker troughing and ridgi=
ng
evolving in the mid-levels across North America, resulting in weaker surfac=
e
low pressure systems that are more progressive. As a result, hazard potenti=
al
looks to wane , as milder conditions are expected to prevail by mid-Novembe=
r .

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue November 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 08 - 12 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a ridge with
above-normal mid-level heights over the Bering Sea and western Alaska, whil=
e a
trough is forecast over the Gulf of Alaska extending southward over the Nor=
th
Pacific, near the West Coast of North America, with below-normal mid-level
heights extending to the northwestern CONUS. A ridge is predicted over the
eastern CONUS, with associated above-normal 500-hPa heights. A trough is
forecast over Florida with slightly below normal mid-level heights.

Mean surface low pressure over the Gulf of Alaska favors predominantly
easterly
and northerly winds increasing probabilities of near- to below-normal
temperatures across Alaska. Below-normal temperature probabilities are
elevated
across the Northwest and Northern California, associated with below-normal
500-hPa heights and anticipated cloudiness. Above-normal temperatures are
favored for the central CONUS, extending to much of the eastern CONUS due t=
o
predicted above-normal mid-level heights. Below-normal temperatures are
favored
for the southern Florida Peninsula in association with below-normal heights=
.

Near- to below-normal precipitation is favored over Alaska associated with
above-normal mid-level heights. Related to the predicted troughing,
above-normal precipitation chances are increased over much of the western
CONUS
extending into the Northern and central Plains, Mississippi Valley, and
western
Great Lakes. Below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over muc=
h
of
the Southwest, Southern Rockies, and parts of the Southern Plains, as well =
as
the Northeast, due to forecast ridging with above-normal mid-level heights.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 10 - 16 2021

During the week-2 period, the predicted 500-hPa flow indicates a potential
pattern change over the CONUS. A mean trough over the Northern Pacific is
forecast to shift westward and sub-tropical ridging is predicted over the
western CONUS with above-normal heights. A short wave trough and associated
below-normal heights are forecast over the east-central CONUS. Downstream o=
f
this trough, a weakening ridge is forecast to progress eastward over the
Northeast,  leading to slightly above normal mid-level heights.


Troughing over Alaska and anomalous northerly mid-level flow over the weste=
rn
CONUS lead to increasing probabilities of below-normal temperatures across
much
of Alaska extending into parts of the northwestern CONUS. Above-normal 500-=
hPa
heights are forecast over the southwestern and northeastern CONUS, favoring
above-normal temperatures across these regions.

With the mean mid-level trough over the Northeast Pacific, increased easter=
ly
and northeasterly flow favors near- to below-normal precipitation across mo=
st
of Alaska. The mean trough over the Northern Pacific favors enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation across much of the western CONU=
S
due to increased onshore flow, extending to the Northern and Central Plains=
,
and Great Lakes. Enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation are a=
lso
favored over the Middle and Lower-Mississippi Valley and the eastern CONUS =
due
to storm system development over these regions, consistent with the
operational
auto-blend tool. Below-normal precipitation is favored over the south-centr=
al
CONUS and parts of the Southwest, related to forecast above-normal mid-leve=
l
heights beneath a mean ridge.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT November 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, surface high pressure favored over the Southeast
could allow for temperatures at or below freezing before the system quickly
moves offshore later in the period. Farther west, , a potent surface storm =
is
expected to move northward through the middle of the CONUS and into Canada,
bringing a chance for heavy precipitation for a broad area from the interio=
r
Southeast and lower Mississippi Valley northward through the upper Midwest.
The
resulting strong surface pressure gradient between this storm and the surfa=
ce
high pressure off the Atlantic Coast increases chances  for unusually stron=
g
winds along and east of the storm track, from the southeastern Great Plains
into the middle Mississippi and lower Ohio Valleys. To the west of the stor=
m
system, northerly winds could bring unusually cold air into parts of the
southern High Plains. Meanwhile, one or more moderate to strong Pacific sto=
rms
forecast early in the period, enhances chances for heavy precipitation west=
 of
the Cascades, with strong winds along parts of Oregon and adjacent Washingt=
on
coastline.. Surface high pressure centered over the Great Basin during the
first half of week-2 introduces the potential for strong downsloping Santa =
Ana
over southern California. In Alaska, very cold air could settle into the
interior northeastern part of the state during the middle of week-2, with
temperatures potentially reaching as low as -40 deg F.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures in the Southeast and
Mid-Atlantic,, Wed, Nov 10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures in the Southern High Plains,
Wed-Sat, Nov 11-12.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures in parts of northeastern Alas=
ka,

Slight risk of heavy precipitation in the interior Southeast, Mississippi
Valley, and western Great Lakes Region, Wed-Sat, Nov 10-13.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation in parts of the Pacific Northwest, Wed-S=
at,
Nov 10-13.

Slight risk of high winds in the south-central Great Plains, Middle
Mississippi
Valley, and Lower Ohio Valley, Wed-Fri, Nov 10-12.

Slight risk of high winds along the Oregon and adjacent Washington coast,

FOR WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 10 - TUESDAY NOVEMBER 16: There is good model agreem=
ent
favoring high surface pressure over the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic Reforeca=
st
tools continue to support a slight risk of much below normal temperatures o=
ver
the region for day 8 (Nov 10), as anomalously cold temperatures are expecte=
d
to
quickly moderate, with this surface high favored to   shift offshore, creat=
ing
southerly surface winds that should quickly bring in milder air. Relative t=
o
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs solutions bring a much stronger ridge than
yesterday into the interior western CONUS, weaker mid-level troughing
(resulting in any associated surface storms tracking farther to the northwe=
st
in the Pacific Ocean and western CONUS), and subnormal 500-hPa heights
extending farther northwest in the eastern CONUS. The northward shift and
weakening height trend keeps the risk of heavy precipitation farther north,
across the Pacific Northwest relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs guidance, and also
increases the chances for strong downsloping Santa Ana winds during the fir=
st
half of week-2 across the southern California coastline,. Additionally,
enhanced chances for high winds remain favored along the Oregon and adjacen=
t
Washington coast, where the surface pressure gradient between the Great Bas=
in
high pressure center and the low pressure systems west of British Columbia
look
to be the strongest.



Models also generally agree that a potentially potent storm system will tra=
ck
northward through the central CONUS. There is better agreement in the model
guidance than yesterday regarding this feature, and also appears to  be mor=
e
pronounced in the latest model runs. The potent surface storm results in
enhanced chances for a variety of hazards through the middle portion of
week-2,
including a swath of heavy precipitation along the storm track running
north-south through the central CONUS, strong southerly winds along and to =
the
east of the storm track, and much below normal temperatures in the wake of =
the
storm across the southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains.



In Alaska, model consensus isn=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDt as robust, but t=
he trough extending
north-south through the state and into the Pacific Ocean could allow very c=
old
air to settle into parts of northeastern and east-central Alaska. But there
are
model inconsistencies regarding how cold temperatures will get, and how lon=
g
the cold air will remain in the region, thereby reducing confidence despite
some models advertising an extremely cold solution.



Toward the end of week-2, nearly all models show weaker troughing and ridgi=
ng
evolving in the mid-levels across North America, resulting in weaker surfac=
e
low pressure systems that are more progressive. As a result, hazard potenti=
al
looks to wane , as milder conditions are expected to prevail by mid-Novembe=
r .

347 PM EDT Tue Nov 02 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Nov 05 2021 - 12Z Tue Nov 09 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the Four Corners late this
week into the Plains early next week, separating mean troughing in
the East and the eastern Pacific into the West. A series of fronts
coming into the Northwest will keep precipitation chances high
there, while a front and developing low pressure system off the
East Coast will spread some rain across Florida and up the
Southeast coast.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models continue to show good agreement in a quick moving shortwave
across the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast and also a southern
stream shortwave through the Southeast on Friday. Uncertainty in
the southeast system increases by the weekend though as models
suggest amplification of the shortwave spinning up a surface low
off the Southeast Coast. The 00z CMC/UKMET are both
stronger/slower with the system as it lifts through the Western
Atlantic early next week. The 06z GFS is ok early on, but by early
next week it may be too quick/weak to eject the system eastward.
WPC favored a blend towards the 00z ECMWF and ensemble means for
this system which also maintains good continuity with the previous
shift.

A persistent train of shortwaves coming into the Pacific Northwest
shows considerable variability as they track across the northern
U.S. and southern Canada this weekend into early next week. Again,
the 06z GFS becomes probablematic as its quicker to break down the
ridge and much faster with one shortwave Sun-Tues. The next system
drops in from Alaska early next week and the GFS is considerably
stronger and farther south with this system next Mon-Tues, but
does have some support from the 00z CMC as well. Run to run
varibility with the deterministic solutions and spread in the
enesmbles suggest enough uncertainty that sticking closer to the
ensemble means is best at this time.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A front over the western Atlantic, Florida peninsula, and the Gulf
of Mexico and a developing surface low along it will cause
rainfall over much of Florida on Friday as ample moisture streams
in. As the low tracks northeastward into the western Atlantic,
some rain is expected on the backside for the coastal Carolinas
and possibly into parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Friday
into Saturday, but how far west precipitation reaches will depend
on the surface low track in the western Atlantic. Current
forecasts do not show rainfall reaching very far inland, given a
more offshore track of the low.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation during the latter half of the week into
early next week near the West Coast. Through the period, the
Pacific Northwest/far northern California can expect the heaviest
precipitation, with normal terrain enhancements and higher
elevation snow. Precipitation is likely to spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies as well, with amounts there
increasing by next Monday into Tuesday.

Behind the aforementioned front in the Gulf, a cold surface high
pressure system will maintain below normal temperatures across the
southeastern CONUS through the weekend, with highs 10-15F below
average and highs/lows 5-10F below normal farther west and north
into southern portions of the Mississippi Valley and the Ohio
Valley. Some of these regions could see overnight temperatures dip
into the mid to low 30s which could result in the first frost of
the season for some places. Meanwhile, a more persistent
upper-level ridge indicated with this forecast cycle over the
west-central U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above
average by 10-20 degrees over the Plains and stretching into the
Midwest. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs somewhat
below normal over the West Coast on most days.

...Lake Effect snow accumulations to persist across portions of
Michigan and New York through today; high elevation snow expected
in the Central Rockies through tomorrow..

...Quasi-stationary boundary to bring heavy rain to portions of
the Southern Plains on Wednesday and Thursday before spreading to
Florida Friday...

...First Freeze potential from the Ozarks into the Northeast this
week...

Cyclonic flow around a deep low pressure system over eastern
Canada is serving to force cool Canadian air southward over the
Great Lakes. When combined with a shortwave disturbance aloft and
completely unfrozen lake surfaces, this surge of cold air out of
the northwest continues to support favorable conditions for lake
effect rain and snow over portions of Michigan and Upstate New
York through Thursday. Scattered Winter Weather Advisories cover
Upper Michigan and Wisconsin through tonight with 2-6" of snow
possible, while the lake effect snow threat will linger over
Western Pennsylvania and New York through tomorrow morning with
localized accumulations up to 3-5". Further West, shortwave trough
activity coupled with a stationary front banked up along the
Central Rockies elevations will focus both rain and snow chances
in North Central-Colorado. Unlike its eastern counterpart,
moderate to heavy snow accumulations in this part of the country
will be relegated to higher elevations above 8500 ft, where total
snow accumulations of 5-10 inches (with locally higher
accumulations) remain possible through tomorrow morning.

In the neighboring Southern Plains, the southern edge of the
aforementioned stationary front is forecast to bring showers and
thunderstorms to much of the region through Thursday morning. The
front is expected to slowly meander south through South-Central
Texas this week, delivering moderate to heavy rainfall to the
eastern portion of the state. With rainfall totals of 1-3" in 24
hours possible in some areas, the Weather Prediction Center has
issued a Marginal Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of
Southeast Texas effective Wednesday morning through Thursday
morning, where isolated flash flooding may occur. Meanwhile, a
series of low pressure systems approaching the Pacific Northwest
will bring light rain and high elevation snow to the region
throughout the period, but no hazardous weather is currently
anticipated.

Temperature-wise, unseasonably cool weather is expected to persist
throughout the Central and Eastern US as surface high pressure
dominates and draws cold air south. The greatest hit to daily
maximum temperatures will be felt in the Central and Southern
Plains where highs are forecast to sit 20 to 25 degrees below
normal as they struggle to escape the 40s and 50s. Moreover, the
anomalously cool airmass in place will support sub-freezing
night-time low temperatures from the Ozarks eastward to the
Northeast through midweek, which may damage sensitive crops and
other outdoor vegetation. Accordingly, a swath of Freeze Warning,
Watches, and Frost Advisories extend from Northwest Arkansas into
New England. In stark contrast to the cold spell to the east,
temperatures from the Rockies to the West Coast are forecast to
remain around average on Tuesday before warming up on Wednesday.
Thanks to a building upper-level ridge, high temperatures across
these regions are expected to rise to 5 to 10 degrees above
average.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to move across northern
California during the day on Thursday. At the surface, a cold front
will move southeast across Nevada. Some dry and gusty winds are
possible ahead of this cold front Thursday afternoon across central
Nevada. However, fuels in this area are quite moist and therefore,
fire weather concerns should remain minimal. Elsewhere, cool and/or
moist conditions and fuels should preclude any fire weather threat.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Wed Nov 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Nov 10 2021

...Overview...

The medium range period will be characterized by an upper ridge
with its axis gradually shifting from the central U.S. over the
weekend toward the East by Tuesday-Wednesday, separating weekend
troughing in the East and rounds of troughing in the eastern
Pacific/West. A series of fronts and shortwaves coming into the
West Coast will keep precipitation chances high there, while a
front and developing low pressure system off the East Coast will
spread some rain across Florida and up the Southeast coast this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance begins the medium range period with reasonably good
agreement this weekend, indicating a shortwave over the
Midwest/Great Lakes and southern stream troughing over the
Southeast beginning to combine in the Eastern Seaboard, shortwave
energy tracking through the Northwest, and upper ridging in the
central U.S. The main exception is the 12Z CMC in the eastern
Pacific/West, as it has less initial energy with the Pacific
Northwest shortwave but more energy dropping southward around
Sunday in the eastern Pacific, causing a mid-upper trough to dig
along the West Coast by Monday. This is not supported by other
guidance including almost all GEFS/EC/CMC ensemble members. The
new 00Z CMC appears to be more in line with consensus, another
indication that leaning away from the 12Z is a good move. Other
than that, a multi-model deterministic blend favoring the 12Z
ECMWF and UKMET and 18Z GFS was used for the beginning of the
period. At the surface, this maintains a low track from the
Florida Peninsula northeastward into the western Atlantic.

As the workweek begins, there are some differences with placement
of shortwaves among guidance, but nothing too out of the ordinary
for that time range. For the most part, deterministic and ensemble
guidance indicate deeper troughing and likely a closed low just
offshore of the Pacific Northwest Tuesday, with troughing/energy
making its way quickly eastward Wednesday. The 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF were both quite strong with this upper closed low and the
associated surface low, and this updated forecast showed an
increase in its strength, though not to the level of 957 or 965 mb
respectively at the surface Tuesday at 12Z. Other than that, the
main change to the previous forecast issuance was pushing a cold
front more quickly through the central U.S., per the recent model
guidance indicating a faster movement of incoming troughing for
the western/central U.S. and upper ridging pushing eastward. The
latter part of the medium range forecast utilized a fairly even
blend of the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean and 12Z ECMWF and EC mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

As a surface low pressure and frontal system develops near/over
Florida Saturday and tracks northeastward into the western
Atlantic, it will spread rain across Florida and into the coastal
Carolinas and possibly the Mid-Atlantic region on the backside of
the low over the weekend. Current forecasts do not show rainfall
reaching very far inland, given a well offshore track of the low,
but small shifts of the low track could lead to significantly more
or less rainfall in coastal areas, especially for the Carolinas.

Abundant moisture ahead of frontal systems and upper-level
shortwaves edging in from the Pacific will result in periods of
enhanced precipitation this weekend into early next week near the
West Coast. Through the period, the Pacific Northwest and northern
California can expect the heaviest precipitation, with normal
terrain enhancements and higher elevation snow. Precipitation is
likely to spread into the Intermountain West and Rockies as well,
with amounts there increasing by next Monday into Wednesday.

Behind the low pressure system in the western Atlantic, a cold
surface high to the west will bring northerly winds and high
temperatures that are 10-20F below normal to the Southeast through
the weekend. Lows could be 5-10F below normal farther north in
this pattern as well, with temperatures in the mid to low 30s for
much of the Ohio Valley Saturday morning, which could result in
the first frost or freeze of the season for some places.
Meanwhile, a persistent upper-level ridge over the west-central
U.S. should lead to temperatures that are above average by 10-20
degrees over the Plains into the Midwest through early next week,
with highs 5-10F above normal stretching toward the East Coast by
Tuesday-Wednesday. Periods of unsettled weather will keep highs
somewhat below normal over the West Coast on most days, eventually
entering into the Great Basin and Rockies by midweek.

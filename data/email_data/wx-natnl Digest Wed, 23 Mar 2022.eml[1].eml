Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1144 AM CDT Tue Mar 22 2022

Valid 221700Z - 231200Z

The overall forecast remains valid with minor changes. See the
previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 03/22/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CDT Tue Mar 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
A long-wave upper trough will progress eastward across the central
U.S. today as a surface low rapidly deepens while tracking northeast
toward the Upper Mississippi Valley. A broad swath of dry
north-northwesterly surface winds will overspread the post-cold
frontal environment from the northern Plains, southward into the
southern High Plains and Desert Southwest, promoting some wildfire
spread potential. Meanwhile, dry offshore flow will also develop
across the northern Mid Atlantic into New England today, posing a
limited risk for localized fire spread amid poorly receptive fuels
on a widespread basis.

...Northern Plains...
By afternoon peak heating, RH is expected to drop to 25 percent as
north-northwesterly surface winds sustain in the 25-30 mph range.
Elevated highlights have been introduced given the presence of dry
fuels. Up to 0.25 inches of precipitation have been observed across
southwest Nebraska. However, the very dry and windy conditions may
compensate to support grass-fire spread.

...Eastern New Mexico into deep-south Texas...
Downslope flow to the lee of the southern Rockies will encourage
20-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid 20-25 percent
RH for several hours tomorrow afternoon. While the forecast RH
marginally supports wildfire spread across the southern High Plains,
the very dry fuels and windy conditions warrant the introduction of
Elevated highlights.

SYNOPSIS: Following a high amplitude height pattern favored by the dynamica=
l
models during week-1, a less amplified and more transient mid-level pattern
looks to be on tap for the lower 48 during week-2. Mid-level low pressure
favored over northeastern U.S. and the West Coast increases the risk for mu=
ch
below normal temperatures which may negatively affect emerging spring
vegetation in parts of California.  Surface low pressure development foreca=
st
over the Great Plains by the outset of the period increases the potential f=
or
heavy precipitation and enhanced wind speeds over parts of the south-centra=
l
and southeastern contiguous U.S.  Over Alaska, prevailing onshore flow is
expected to promote above-normal temperatures and precipitation mainly
throughout the southern Mainland.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Northeast, Wed, Mar 3=
0.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for the Central Valley of
California, Thu-Sat, Mar 31-Apr 2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Lower and Middle
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and the Southeast, Wed-Thu, Mar 30=
-
31.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Great Plains, Mississippi,
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic,

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 30 - TUESDAY APRIL 05: There is a continued consensus i=
n
the dynamical models featuring an amplified 500-hPa height pattern over the
CONUS during late week-1 that deamplifies and becomes more transient during
the
week-2 period.  However, there are differences in the predicted mid-level
height fields in the latest runs of ECMWF and GEFS ensembles mainly east of
the
Rockies, contributing to added uncertainty in today's hazard outlook. Compa=
red
to yesterday, there are better indications of a shortwave disturbance over =
the
central CONUS in the 0z GEFS, whereas the 0z ECMWF has backed off of this
potential, instead favoring more of the troughing energy downstream over th=
e
northeastern CONUS during the first few days of the period. Upstream, there=
 is
better agreement in this morning's ensemble guidance in regards to a deepen=
ing
500-hPa trough axis shifting eastward from the eastern Pacific. This mid-le=
vel
feature is favored to bring anomalous cold temperatures and increased
precipitation over parts of the western CONUS by the beginning of April.



The Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) day 7 surface analysis features stron=
g
northerly flow over the northeastern CONUS in the wake of a frontal system
exiting the U.S.  With cold air advection favored in ensembles over the
region,
there is agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting an
area with at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 1=
5th
percentile and below freezing over the Northeast to support a slight risk o=
f
much below normal temperatures for Mar 30. By day 9 (Mar 31), the ECMWF
maintains the cold signal due to the aforementioned mid-level troughing tha=
t
is
favored to persist over the Northeast, however the GEFS favors a faster
moderation of temperatures over the highlighted area early in the period.
Farther west, the development of mid-level troughing over the West Coast is
anticipated to usher in colder temperatures and increased moisture for many
parts of the western CONUS through the middle of the period. While reforeca=
st
tools reflect increased signals for amounts exceeding the 85th percentile,
these amounts are not expected to be heavy enough to reach hazard threshold=
s
which should provide much needed ground moisture for many drought stricken
areas in the West. Of greater concern, however, is the favored drop in
temperatures as reforecast tools indicate stronger signals for minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below freezing over
portions
of the Pacific Northwest and California compared to yesterday.
Climatologically, many lower elevation areas of California typically
experience
their last freeze during early to mid-March, and the growing potential for
sub-freezing temperatures in early April may impact emerging spring vegetat=
ion
mainly over the Central California Valley. As a result, a slight risk of mu=
ch
below normal temperatures is added over California for Mar 31 to Apr 2. As
this
anomalous troughing aloft is favored to eventually propagate eastward and
weaken, more seasonable temperatures are expected over the western CONUS la=
ter
in the period.



For precipitation, surface low formation remains favored in the lee of the
Rockies late in week-1. As the low tracks eastward early in the period, ret=
urn
flow from the Gulf of Mexico favors the enhancement of available moisture
throughout the warm sector over portions of the Lower Mississippi, Tennesse=
e
and Ohio Valleys, and the Southeast. This is reflected in the uncalibrated
GEFS
guidance with increased daily precipitation accumulations over the region,
where there is also at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation accumulati=
ons
exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch in the GEFS reforecast tool early =
in
the period. Although the latest ECMWF guidance has become more tenuous with
this heavy precipitation potential, a slight risk of heavy precipitation
remains posted for Mar 30 to 31 given the favorable surface pattern, as wel=
l
as
continued support from the Canadian deterministic and ensemble mean solutio=
ns.
Tied to this surface low, there is continued agreement between the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools over the southeastern CONUS showing at least a 20%
chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile early in the period. Wi=
th
deterministic and ensemble mean solutions depicting periods of strong press=
ure
gradients, a broad slight risk area of high winds remains posted and is
expanded eastward to the eastern seaboard from Mar 30 to Apr 1. Later in th=
e
period, ensembles show the potential for additional surface low formation
across the Great Plains tied to another shortwave disturbance. No
precipitation
or wind related hazards are issued due to uncertainty at this lead, but any
developing hazard potential will continue to be monitored and addressed in =
the
upcoming outlooks.



Over Alaska, ensembles predominantly favor onshore flow during week-2, whic=
h
is
expected to lead to above-normal temperatures and precipitation. Although t=
he
ECMWF reforecast tool remains more pronounced with the precipitation potent=
ial
compared to the GEFS, indicating at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitati=
on
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile along the southern Mainland and
Panhandle, amounts are not expected to reach hazard criteria. However, the
persistence of anomalously warmer and wetter conditions over the state bear=
s
close monitoring later in April as this may accelerate river ice breakup wh=
ich
raises concern for ice jams and potential river flooding.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CDT Tue Mar 22 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough will meander across the central U.S. while a surface
low gradually drifts into the Great Lakes region tomorrow/Wednesday.
With surface high pressure building into the central Rockies,
gradient-induced northwesterly winds will persist across the Plains
states, with wildfire-spread concerns developing in areas of drier
air, especially across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Downslope flow along the lee of the southern Rockies will support
10-20 percent RH across eastern New Mexico into western Texas, along
with widespread 20+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds
Wednesday afternoon. Critical highlights have been introduced where
the guidance consensus depicts the longest-lasting favorable wind/RH
overlap, and where forecast fuel ERCs reach the 90th percentile on
at least a spotty basis.

...Northern High Plains...
Similar to Day 1, 20-30 mph sustained north-northwesterly winds will
persist through Wednesday. While temperatures are expected to be
cool overall, the latest guidance consensus suggests that RH may
drop as low as 20 percent in spots. Given the presence of a moderate
to severe drought and at least modestly dry fuels in place, Elevated
highlights have been introduced.

300 PM EDT Tue Mar 22 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 25 2022 - 12Z Tue Mar 29 2022

...Overview...

An amplified upper level pattern is expected to prevail through
the medium range period as a ridge begins to build over the
western U.S. while a broad trough in the eastern U.S. will be
reinforced and possibly amplified by intrusions of colder air from
central/eastern Canada.  A general cooling and drying trend is
expected across the Northeast as potentially record-setting warmth
in the West spreads eastward into the High Plains by early next
week.  The most uncertain aspect in the pattern will likely be off
the West Coast where the timing and amplitude of a trough or
potentially closed low will affect when and if any significant
precipitation will move onshore for early next week.  Despite the
uncertain with the timing of the West Coast trough, model ensemble
means indicate decent agreement for a surface low pressure system
to develop in the central Plains by next Tuesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning begins with generally good agreement
on slowly pulling out the low pressure system off New England on
Friday and into the weekend.  Meanwhile, a clipper system is
forecast to move across the northern Plains and interact with the
departing low pressure system over new England.  Models continue
to indicate some difficulties in timing this interaction,
resulting in uncertainty on the subsequent details of the trough
amplification as well as the positions surface fronts over the
eastern U.S.  There is some potential for modest cyclogenesis to
occur just off the New England coast by about Sunday.

Over the western U.S., models are in general agreement with a
ridge building across the region.  In contrast, much uncertainty
lies off the West Coast where an upper trough is forecast to
amplify.  Models show considerable uncertainty on the subsequent
evolution of this trough.  The GFS and CMC maintain that this
feature will move into the western U.S. early next week.  The
recent couple of runs of ECMWF, however, have abandoned this
scenario by closing off this trough and digs it southward well off
the West Coast.  This scenario is possible given the increasingly
high amplitude nature of the pattern by the weekend.
Nevertheless, the 00Z EC mean appears at odds with the EC
deterministic by forming a low pressure system over central Plains
next Tuesday in agreement with the GFS and CMC, which would imply
a faster progression of the trough through the western U.S.

Thus the WPC medium-range package was based on the consensus of
the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, with
increasing usage of the ensemble means by Day 5.  A small
contribution of the 00Z CMC was included for Days 3-4 followed by
a small amount from the CMC mean Days 5-7.  The results are
reasonably compatible with WPC continuity except the timing of low
pressure waves off the West Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Snow is forecast to linger in Maine on Friday as a low pressure
center slowly exits New England.  Then shortwave energy and weak
low pressure/frontal systems are expected to produce light
precipitation as they move across the Great Lakes region to the
central/northern Appalachians and Northeast late week into the
weekend.  Some of the precipitation will be in the form of snow in
higher elevations and northern latitudes, and gusty winds are also
possible.  Precipitation ahead of the approaching eastern Pacific
upper trough is likely to reach the Pacific Northwest around
Friday and then spread across more of the West thereafter.  Most
of this activity should be in the light to moderate range but some
locally heavier totals could be possible depending on the
uncertain timing of system details.  Coverage and intensity of
this precipitation becomes more uncertain by late weekend into
early next week.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday, with some plus 20-25F anomalies
appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving to the
northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper ridge
axis shifts. Daily record temperatures could be tied or set across
California and eastward. Temperatures in the West are likely to
cool closer to normal by around Monday but the exact timing will
depend on the trough's movement inland. Meanwhile the East should
see near to slightly below average temperatures given mean upper
troughing, with coolest temperatures of 10-15F below normal in the
central Appalachians for the weekend and in the Great Lakes early
next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue March 22 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 28 - APR 01, 2022

The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian ensembles are all in good agreement regard=
ing
an amplified 500-hPa geopotential height pattern across North America at th=
e
outset of the 6-10 day forecast period. There is a strong blocking signal
across the western Atlantic, with anomalous ridging near Greenland, and
troughing to the south across the northeastern CONUS and northwest Atlantic=
.
This setup is indicative of a negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillat=
ion
(NAO), although both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles weaken this signal toward
the
end of the period. Ridging is initially forecast upstream over the west-
central
CONUS, with troughing predicted to move into the western CONUS later in
week-2,
with a deamplification of the height pattern across the remainder of the CO=
NUS
likely by the end of the period. For the period as a whole, today=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual
blend depicts positive 500-hPa height anomalies over parts of the Great
Plains,
and negative height anomalies across the eastern third of the CONUS, with t=
he
largest negative departures over the Northeast. Near to below normal height=
s
are predicted along the West Coast as troughing moves into the western CONU=
S.
Anomalous ridging forecast to develop south of Alaska favors near to above
normal mid-level heights over much of the state, with troughing upstream ov=
er
the Bering Sea favoring below normal heights across the far western Aleutia=
ns.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are favored for portio=
ns
of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, Northeast, and
northern mid-Atlantic, consistent with the forecast negative phase of the N=
AO
and supported by teleconnection analysis with the negative height anomaly
center near Nova Scotia. Daily temperature departures of -10 to -15 deg F a=
re
possible, especially early in the period, with some areas likely experienci=
ng
a
hard freeze during the final days of March. As the initial troughing lifts =
out
and the mid-level pattern becomes less amplified later in the period, a
moderation in temperatures is predicted. Probabilities for above normal
temperatures are increased for the period as a whole across much of the
western
and central CONUS underneath predicted ridging early in the period, and
supported by both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. However, a reduction=
 in
temperatures is possible across the West by the middle of the period as
troughing becomes more dominant, with near to even below normal temperature=
s
becoming favored over parts of the West for the period as a whole. Near to
above normal temperatures are favored across much of Alaska due to forecast
ridging to the south of the state. The exception is over parts of the
southeastern Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, where increased probabiliti=
es
for below normal temperatures are favored, supported by the uncalibrated EC=
MWF
and GEFS ensembles.

Enhanced probabilities for near to above normal precipitation are indicated
for
much of the CONUS during the period. While the period may start off relativ=
ely
dry in most areas, the deamplification of the 500-hPa height pattern combin=
ed
with troughing moving into the West favors increasing precipitation chances=
.
The GEFS and Canadian ensembles depict cyclogenesis in the lee of the Rocki=
es,
potentially increasing precipitation across parts of the east-central CONUS=
,
although the ECMWF forecast is not as robust. Below normal precipitation
probabilities remain increased across the Southern Plains, consistent with =
the
ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools. Southwesterly flow across Alaska ahead of
troughing over the Bering Sea favors a tilt toward increased above normal
precipitation probabilities across southwestern areas of the state. Below
normal precipitation probabilities are increased across the northern coast,
due
to greater influence from above normal heights forecast over the Arctic Oce=
an,
and across the southern Alaska Panhandle, under anomalously northerly flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement regarding an amplified 500-hPa height pattern early in the
period, offset by increasing uncertainty later in the period as the pattern
becomes less amplified.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 30 - APR 05, 2022

A transient 500-hPa geopotential height pattern is favored across North
America
during week-2, reducing the overall confidence in the forecast. There is st=
ill
a negative NAO signal across eastern North America, although it is weaker t=
han
in the 6-10 day period, and heights are relatively higher in the East.
Enhanced
troughing is favored to propagate through the western and central CONUS, wi=
th
a
generally mean zonal flow downstream to the east, with oscillating weak
shortwave troughs and ridges. These features are not anticipated to be
constant, and as a result, near normal 500-hPa heights are indicated over m=
uch
of the CONUS for the week-2 period as a whole, with the exception being the
Northeast where below normal heights remain predicted. A more amplified 500=
-
hPa
pattern is forecast to persist across the North Pacific, with troughing ove=
r
the Bering Sea and ridging over the Northeast Pacific. This supports a
continuation of near to above normal mid-level heights across much of Alask=
a,
with the exception of the far western coast of the Mainland and the Aleutia=
ns
where below normal heights are favored.

Given the less amplified pattern and increased Pacific flow across the CONU=
S,
both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate increased probabilities f=
or
above normal temperatures over much of the CONUS during week-2. However, th=
e
uncalibrated guidance is on the colder side, particularly across the West
where
troughing is forecast, and in the northeastern quadrant of the CONUS due to
the
continuing negative NAO signal. Therefore, a tilt towards increased below
normal temperature probabilities is indicated over much of the western CONU=
S
along with the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and
Northeast, and is also supported by the statistical analog tool. Above norm=
al
temperature probabilities are increased across the Southern Plains eastward
through the southern mid-Atlantic and Southeast, with the highest
probabilities
across Florida. Elevated probabilities for near to above normal temperature=
s
remain favored for most of Alaska, due to persistent southwesterly mid-leve=
l
flow ahead of troughing forecast over the Bering Sea, with some lingering
elevated below normal temperature probabilities over the Panhandle and extr=
eme
eastern Mainland.

Increased chances for near to above normal precipitation are favored for mu=
ch
of the CONUS during week-2, with early troughing in the West resulting in
elevated precipitation chances in that region, and intermittent shortwaves
enhancing precipitation chances downstream over the central and eastern CON=
US.
The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools are in fairly good agreement regarding
this
scenario and the large-scale precipitation pattern, with higher probabiliti=
es
for above normal precipitation over the western (southeastern) CONUS in the
ECMWF (GEFS). The GEFS and Canadian ensembles indicate a potential surface =
low
and associated frontal system bringing enhanced precipitation to the
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, and the Southeast early in week-2.  Both
reforecast tools support enhanced below normal precipitation probabilities
across parts of the Southern Plains and Desert Southwest, farther displaced
from the mean mid-level moisture flow. Continued enhanced southwesterly flo=
w
ahead of troughing over the Bering Sea favors increased chances for near to
above normal precipitation across Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a forecast low amplitude mid-level pattern across the forecast domain, and
differences in the temperature forecasts between the uncalibrated and
calibrated guidance.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall together with severe thunderstorms
likely across the Deep South Tuesday with a lessening threat into
the Southeast on Wednesday...

...Some wintry weather possible across the northern Mississippi
Valley and Great Lakes on Tuesday into Wednesday...

...Record heat for parts of California mid-week, with a critical
fire weather threat across the southern High Plains...


A robust spring storm currently in the southern Plains will
continue the threat for unsettled weather across the central U.S.
and Midwest on Tuesday, and into the East by Wednesday. A deep
surge of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico interacting with
favorable dynamics both at the surface and aloft helped fuel
widespread heavy rainfall and severe thunderstorms across eastern
Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley overnight, which should
steadily press eastward into the central Gulf Coast and Tennessee
Valley states today. Rainfall totals of 3-5 inches, with locally
higher amounts, are forecast in this region through Tuesday night,
contributing to numerous and potentially significant flash
flooding. WPC has highlighted parts of the lower Mississippi
Valley into Mississippi and Alabama within a moderate risk for
excessive rainfall. At the same time, SPC continues to highlight
an enhanced to moderate risk for severe weather across roughly the
same region, with storms capable of producing strong tornadoes,
large hail, and damaging winds.

Rainfall associated with this system will also expand into the
Midwest and middle/upper Mississippi Valley on Tuesday, with some
wintry precipitation possible across far northern regions.
Generally light to moderate snow and freezing rain accumulations
are possible into Wednesday across northern Minnesota and the
northern Great Lakes. The storm system will move into the Eastern
U.S. on Wednesday, although impacts are expected to be less
widespread and less intense. Even so, WPC still shows a slight
risk for flash flooding across the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday,
with SPC highlighting a slight risk for severe weather up into the
Southeast. This system should exit the East Coast on Thursday,
with some lingering heavy coastal rain and light snow across New
England. A cold air mass for this time of the year should filter
in behind this system, with much below normal temperatures across
the southern Rockies and High Plains on Tuesday, moving into the
Mississippi Valley and the Midwest Wednesday and Thursday.

Elsewhere, gusty winds and dry conditions across the southern High
Plains should lead to another day of elevated to critical fire
weather threats on Wednesday. A front into the Northwest, will
spread light rain and mountain snows across the Pacific Northwest
and northern Rockies on Tuesday. A ridge building across the
Western U.S. during mid week will bring well above normal
temperatures to much of the West with daytime highs running 10 to
20 degrees, or more, in some places. Record highs are possible in
parts of mainly the interior valley of California through at least
Thursday.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall with severe thunderstorms likely
across the Deep South on Tuesday with a lessening threat into the
Southeast and Ohio Valley on Wednesday...

Tuesday into Wednesday...

...Critical fire weather threat across western Texas on Wednesday,

A potent storm system in the central U.S. will continue to bring a
multitude of weather hazards to the Midwest and Southeast today
before moving into the East on Wednesday, as it continues its
progression throughout the afternoon and evening. Warm, moist air
being advected from the Gulf of Mexico ahead of an advancing cold
front, accompanied by favorable dynamics at the surface and aloft,
will lead to dangerous severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall
across a large portion of the lower Mississippi Valley today. As a
result, the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) has issued a moderate
risk for severe thunderstorms in eastern Louisiana and southern
Mississippi, where tornadoes, some of which are expected to be
strong, and potentially widespread damaging winds can be expected.
Due to the convective nature of these storms, heavy rainfall rates
are also likely, leading to a moderate risk of excessive rainfall
being issued for Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, where the
potential for 3-5 inches (locally upwards of 6-9 inches) of
rainfall exists. The severe threat should wane into the overnight
hours as the environment becomes less favorable for the
development and continuation of thunderstorms. Further north,
cooler temperatures behind the cold front will allow for wintry
precipitation, with portions of the UP of Michigan, and
northeastern Minnesota under Winter Storm Warnings and Winter
Weather Advisories, where several inches of snow, in addition to
sleet and freezing rain is possible.

The storm system will move into the East on Wednesday, where
hazards are expected to be less severe as a cooler, more stable
airmass will inhibit the convective potential that was present on
Tuesday. However, the SPC has issued two areas of Slight Risk for
severe thunderstorms in western Ohio and Indiana, as well as a
large swath of the Southeast coastal plain, stretching from North
Carolina southward into the Florida panhandle. Large
hail and strong wind gusts are the most probable severe hazards,
but a tornado or two is also possible, especially in the
Southeast. Furthermore, a small Slight Risk for excessive rainfall
has also been issued for parts of the Florida panhandle.
Elsewhere, light to moderate rainfall is expected across much of
the Northeast, with pockets of wintry precipitation in the highest
elevations of interior New England, where Winter Weather
Advisories have been issued. Conditions should begin to improve
during the Thursday afternoon hours, as the low-pressure begins to
move offshore. In its wake, pleasant conditions can be expected in
the Eastern region with seasonable temperatures through the end of
the week.

Further west, dry conditions and strong winds across southwestern
Texas and the Plains have led to elevated to critical fire weather
threats on Wednesday, with the threat diminishing on Thursday as
winds subside ahead of a high pressure building in. A weak storm
system is also expected to move through the western U.S. this
week, bringing with it the potential for light rain showers in the
valleys, and snow showers in the higher elevations of the
Intermountain West. Furthermore, temperatures running 10-20
degrees F above-average are possible in the West through midweek,
with portions of California and the Great Basin potentially
experiencing record high-temperatures on Wednesday and Thursday.

...Overview...

An amplified upper level pattern is expected to prevail through
the medium range period as a ridge begins to build over the
western U.S. while a broad trough in the eastern U.S. will be
reinforced and possibly amplified by intrusions of colder air from
central/eastern Canada.  A general cooling and drying trend is
expected across the Northeast as potentially record-setting warmth
in the West spreads eastward into the High Plains by early next
week.  The most uncertain aspect in the pattern will likely be off
the West Coast where the timing and amplitude of a trough or
potentially closed low will affect when and if any significant
precipitation will move onshore for early next week.  Despite the
uncertain timing of the West Coast trough, model ensemble means
indicate decent agreement for a surface low pressure system to
develop in the central Plains by next Tuesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning begins with generally good agreement
on slowly pulling out the low pressure system off New England on
Friday and into the weekend.  Meanwhile, a clipper system is
forecast to move across the northern Plains and interact with the
departing low pressure system over new England.  Models continue
to indicate some difficulties in timing this interaction,
resulting in uncertainty on the subsequent details of the trough
amplification as well as the positions of surface fronts over the
eastern U.S.  There is some potential for modest cyclogenesis to
occur just off the New England coast by about Sunday.

Over the western U.S., models are in general agreement with a
ridge building across the region.  In contrast, much uncertainty
lies off the West Coast where an upper trough is forecast to
amplify.  Models show considerable uncertainty on the subsequent
evolution of this trough.  The GFS and CMC maintain that this
feature will move into the western U.S. early next week.  The
recent couple of runs of ECMWF, however, have abandoned this
scenario by closing off this trough and digs it southward well off
the West Coast.  This scenario is possible given the increasingly
high amplitude nature of the pattern by the weekend.
Nevertheless, the 00Z EC mean appears at odds with the EC
deterministic by forming a low pressure system over central Plains
next Tuesday in agreement with the GFS and CMC, which would imply
a faster progression of the trough through the western U.S.

Thus the WPC medium-range package was based on the consensus of
the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, with
increasing usage of the ensemble means by Day 5.  A small
contribution of the 00Z CMC was included for Days 3-4 followed by
a small amount from the CMC mean Days 5-7.  The results are
reasonably compatible with WPC continuity except the timing of low
pressure waves off the West Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Snow is forecast to linger in Maine on Friday as a low pressure
center slowly exits New England.  Then shortwave energy and weak
low pressure/frontal systems are expected to produce light
precipitation as they move across the Great Lakes region to the
central/northern Appalachians and Northeast late week into the
weekend.  Some of the precipitation will be in the form of snow in
higher elevations and near the Canadian border followed by strong
and gusty winds with falling temperatures.  Precipitation ahead of
the approaching eastern Pacific upper trough is likely to reach
the Pacific Northwest around Friday.  Most of this activity should
be in the light to moderate range but some locally heavier totals
are possible.  By early next week, precipitation associated with
an upper trough could move into the western or southwestern U.S.
but with uncertain timing and intensity of system details.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday, with some plus 20-25F anomalies
appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving to the
northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper ridge
axis shifts east.  Daily record temperatures could be tied or set
across California and eastward.  Temperatures in the West are
likely to cool closer to normal by around Monday but the exact
timing will depend on the trough's movement inland. Meanwhile the
East should see near to slightly below average temperatures given
mean upper troughing, with coolest temperatures of 10-15F below
normal in the central Appalachians for the weekend and in the
Great Lakes early next week.

precipitation will move onshore for early next week.  Despite the
uncertain timing of the West Coast trough, model ensemble means
indicate decent agreement for a surface low pressure system to
develop in the central Plains by next Tuesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Model guidance this morning begins with generally good agreement
on slowly pulling out the low pressure system off New England on
Friday and into the weekend.  Meanwhile, a clipper system is
forecast to move across the northern Plains and interact with the
departing low pressure system over new England.  Models continue
to indicate some difficulties in timing this interaction,
resulting in uncertainty on the subsequent details of the trough
amplification as well as the positions of surface fronts over the
eastern U.S.  There is some potential for modest cyclogenesis to
occur just off the New England coast by about Sunday.

Over the western U.S., models are in general agreement with a
ridge building across the region.  In contrast, much uncertainty
lies off the West Coast where an upper trough is forecast to
amplify.  Models show considerable uncertainty on the subsequent
evolution of this trough.  The GFS and CMC maintain that this
feature will move into the western U.S. early next week.  The
recent couple of runs of ECMWF, however, have abandoned this
scenario by closing off this trough and digs it southward well off
the West Coast.  This scenario is possible given the increasingly
high amplitude nature of the pattern by the weekend.
Nevertheless, the 00Z EC mean appears at odds with the EC
deterministic by forming a low pressure system over central Plains
next Tuesday in agreement with the GFS and CMC, which would imply
a faster progression of the trough through the western U.S.

Thus the WPC medium-range package was based on the consensus of
the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, with
increasing usage of the ensemble means by Day 5.  A small
contribution of the 00Z CMC was included for Days 3-4 followed by
a small amount from the CMC mean Days 5-7.  The results are
reasonably compatible with WPC continuity except the timing of low
pressure waves off the West Coast.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Snow is forecast to linger in Maine on Friday as a low pressure
center slowly exits New England.  Then shortwave energy and weak
low pressure/frontal systems are expected to produce light
precipitation as they move across the Great Lakes region to the
central/northern Appalachians and Northeast late week into the
weekend.  Some of the precipitation will be in the form of snow in
higher elevations and near the Canadian border followed by strong
and gusty winds with falling temperatures.  Precipitation ahead of
the approaching eastern Pacific upper trough is likely to reach
the Pacific Northwest around Friday.  Most of this activity should
be in the light to moderate range but some locally heavier totals
are possible.  By early next week, precipitation associated with
an upper trough could move into the western or southwestern U.S.
but with uncertain timing and intensity of system details.

Unseasonably warm temperatures will build and expand underneath
upper ridging from the western U.S. into the Plains. Highs that
are 10-20F above normal will be common over California and the
Great Basin/Southwest Friday, with some plus 20-25F anomalies
appearing in the Great Basin Saturday and moving to the
northern/central High Plains early next week as the upper ridge
axis shifts east.  Daily record temperatures could be tied or set
across California and eastward.  Temperatures in the West are
likely to cool closer to normal by around Monday but the exact
timing will depend on the trough's movement inland. Meanwhile the
East should see near to slightly below average temperatures given
mean upper troughing, with coolest temperatures of 10-15F below
normal in the central Appalachians for the weekend and in the
Great Lakes early next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST IDAHO INTO SOUTHERN
WYOMING...

Mid-morning satellite and surface observations suggest the forecast
generally remains on track. Critical wind/RH conditions remain most
likely from the Snake River Valley in southeast ID into southern WY
where mid-level flow will be strongest throughout the day. The
Elevated risk area was expanded southward into southern UT where RH
values are already in the 15-20% (and falling) and several hi-res
solutions suggest areas of 15-20 mph winds will occur (likely driven
by terrain features), though the potential for critical conditions
will remain low.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
A few lightning strikes are noted across western MT this morning as
the upper-level wave exits northern ID. The dry thunderstorm threat
will gradually diminish from west to east through the day as lift
overspreads an air mass with deeper moisture. Further south,
isolated dry thunderstorms remain likely across CO this afternoon. A
third dry thunderstorm risk area was introduced to southern UT where
hi-res ensemble guidance hints at convection this afternoon, but
PWAT values will remain in the 0.6 to 0.8 inch range. While storm
coverage is somewhat uncertain for southern UT, a deep, dry
boundary-layer should support a dry lightning potential with any
storms that can occur.

..Moore.. 07/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1218 AM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave will progress out of the Northwest and into
parts of the northern Rockies today. An upper-level ridge will
remain anchored in the Four Corners. At the surface, a modest lee
cyclone will develop in the central Plains.

...Northeastern Great Basin into southern Wyoming...
A combination of moderate to strong mid-level flow and surface low
development east of the Divide will promote 15-25 mph winds across
southern Idaho and Wyoming into northern Utah and northwest
Colorado. Afternoon RH will range from 10-20%. Sustained critical
conditions are most likely from eastern portions of the Snake River
Plain into southwestern Wyoming.

...Portions of Colorado Western Slope...
Mid-level moisture within the Four Corners ridge will again support
thunderstorm development across parts of western Colorado. PWAT
values will range from 0.4-0.6 inches in this area. Though storm
motions will not be overly quick, dry boundary layer conditions will
keep most storms dry. Fuels remain critically dry in most locations,
though they become more marginal near the Divide.

...Western Montana...
With the approach of the shortwave trough, elevated thunderstorms
are possible early in the forecast period. These storms will be fast
moving with relatively dry air beneath them. Dry fuels will support
a threat for lightning ignitions. Towards the afternoon, additional
thunderstorms may develop along the higher terrain and move
eastward. These storms may initially be a mix of wet and dry modes
before transitioning to primarily wet as they move into better
moisture.

...Excessive Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat Mid-Later Next Week...


...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave now underway under upper ridging will continue for
the Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early-mid next week
with temperatures 10-20F above normal. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday/Wednesday in these
areas. The model consensus is leading to gradually lowering
heights with a developing modest northwest US trough, with the
highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ as more
progressive/flatter flow emerges over the U.S. northern tier.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may support above normal temperatures next week from the
Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the Northeast. This
includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate some potential for temperature
moderating showers/thunderstorms over the Southwest/Southern
Rockies next week with pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative
humidity in place to support diurnal activity with instability
peaking each afternoon/evening. However, this could also fuel
additional local downpour and terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is also a growing signal for the emergence of a multi-day
heavy rainfall/convective repeat pattern into the Midwest
Wednesday-Friday as shortwave energies reinforce upper troughing

Midwest to the Mid-MS/OH Valleys with slow system translation.
This offers runoff threats with the region slated for chances of
heavy rainfall over short range time frames.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week remains low in a
slowly evolving pattern with a mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge gradually suppressing into southern Cal and vicinity
early next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles
along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad
composite maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate
smaller scale guidance differences, especially over time with
convective focus and for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough. Latest 12 UTC guidance
overall still maintains this medium range solution.

...Excessive Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat Mid-Later Next Week...


...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave now underway under upper ridging will continue for
the Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early-mid next week
with temperatures 10-20F above normal. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday/Wednesday in these
areas. The model consensus is leading to gradually lowering
heights with a developing modest northwest US trough, with the
highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ as more
progressive/flatter flow emerges over the U.S. northern tier.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may support above normal temperatures next week from the
Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the Northeast. This
includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate some potential for temperature
moderating showers/thunderstorms over the Southwest/Southern
Rockies next week with pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative
humidity in place to support diurnal activity with instability
peaking each afternoon/evening. However, this could also fuel
additional local downpour and terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is also a growing signal for the emergence of a multi-day
heavy rainfall/convective repeat pattern into the Midwest
Wednesday-Friday as shortwave energies reinforce upper troughing
over the north-central U.S. and as moisture and instability pool
along/ahead of a wavy front. Main focus may shift from the Upper
Midwest to the Mid-MS/OH Valleys with slow system translation.
This offers runoff threats with the region slated for chances of
heavy rainfall over short range time frames.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

Recent guidance has trended towards a slight increase in the
coverage of 15-20 mph across southern UT, warranting a small
expansion of the Elevated risk area in the Great Basin. An Elevated
risk area is introduced along the lee of the Cascades where 15-20
mph winds (with localized stronger gusts) are expected through the
passes. While humidity values are forecast to generally be between
15-30%, recent reports from the region indicate that ongoing fires
have shown active behavior in higher RH environments. Additionally,
an Elevated risk area is also introduced to parts of the San Joaquin
Valley in central CA where winds near 15 mph will likely be
coincident with 10-15% RH and receptive fuels.

Along with the Sierra Nevada and western CO, isolated thunderstorms
are likely across central to northern AZ. While dry boundary layers
may support a few dry lightning strikes, high PWAT values (0.75
inches or higher) and slow storm motions will increase the potential
for wetting rainfall. However, these storms may produce gusty winds
in the vicinity of ongoing fires.

..Moore.. 07/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0120 AM CDT Fri Jul 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
The Four Corners upper-level ridge will intensify and retrograde
westward on Saturday. The mid-level trough in the northern Rockies
will move eastward before dropping southward, around the ridge, into
the central Plains. At the surface, cooler air will move southward
into the northern/central Rockies and adjacent Plains.

Locally elevated conditions are possible in portions of the West.
Strong heating in the Columbia Basin will drive gap winds through
the Cascades amid dry surface conditions. In the northern Great
Basin, modest mid-level winds may mix to the surface, but the
surface pattern will be quite weak. Isolated thunderstorms are
possible  in parts of the Sierra as well as western Colorado. With
the upper-level ridge intensifying, the overall coverage of dry
storms appears too low for highlights.

...Central/Eastern Utah and adjacent western Colorado...
The greatest potential for sustained elevated fire weather
conditions will exist in parts of the eastern Great Basin. Modest
mid-level winds will combine with an enhanced surface pressure
gradient behind the passing front to bring 15-20 mph northerly winds
to the region. RH could fall into the single digits, though most
areas will see 10-20% by the afternoon.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 09 2021

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure across the western two-thirds of
the
lower 48 is expected to sustain the risk for excessive heat across the western
and North-Central contiguous U.S., with this risk shifting eastward over the
north-central contiguous U.S. toward the end of week-2. Surface low pressure
development and frontal activity across the eastern lower 48 increases the
potential for heavy precipitation across parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley
to the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, with possible hydrological impacts focused
over Illinois. An active North American Monsoon circulation is expected to
promote above-normal precipitation and possible flooding over the Desert
Southwest. Over Alaska, increased chances for above normal temperatures are
forecast over parts of the Mainland which may help to dry fuels for ongoing
wildfire activity.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley,
Northern Plains, Northern and Central Rockies, and Great Basin, Sat-Mon, Jul
17-19.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western and north-central CONUS,
Sat-Fri, Jul 17-23.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee Valley, Sat-Mon, Jul 17-19.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal parts of California,
Sat-Wed, Jul 17-21.

Possible flooding for portions of Illinois, Iowa, Missouri,Indiana, and
Michigan.

Possible flooding for portions of Arizona and New Mexico.

FOR SATURDAY JULY 17 - FRIDAY JULY 23: Dynamical models predict more amplified
mid-level ridging over the western and north-central CONUS during the period
compared to yesterday and earlier this week resulting in a stronger heat
signal
in the reforecast tools for these regions. Positive 500-hPa height departures
across these regions are anticipated to shift eastward and weaken by the end
of
the period, translating to a similar eastward shift of the increased risk for
excessive heat. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools maintain a broad
coverage of elevated chances (>20%) for daily maximum temperatures exceeding
the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F extending from California to the Upper
Mississippi Valley. Thus, a slight risk of excessive heat remains issued for
much of the western and north-central CONUS for week-2. Higher probabilities
for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F exist
in the reforecast tool guidance over a greater area compared to yesterday, for
the beginning of the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool limits the region of
greater than 40% chance for these excessive heat thresholds mainly to the
Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, whereas the GEFS reforecast tool
indicates this >40% probability over the Great Basin, Northern Plains, and
Upper Mississippi Valley. A moderate risk for excessive heat is posted for
portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Northern Plains, Northern and
Central
Rockies, and Great Basin, July 17 to 19. The risk for excessive heat across
parts of New England is removed in today's outlook since the models generally
favor mid-level troughing across the area during the period.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance continues to favor surface low formation
and frontal activity tied to shortwave troughing aloft early in week-2 across
parts of the eastern CONUS. Surface high pressure is also forecast over the
Southeast, which favors enhanced Gulf moisture advection into the central and
eastern CONUS, supporting increased chances for enhanced precipitation across
portions of Eastern CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show at
least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and
one inch over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is highlighted across parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley,
Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Tennessee Valley, July 17 to 19, that includes
the aforementioned areas highlighted by the reforecast tools as well as a
broader region indicated by the uncalibrated ECMWF for increased chances of
3-day totals exceeding one inch.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble guidance continues to favor surface low formation
and frontal activity tied to shortwave troughing aloft early in week-2 across
parts of the eastern CONUS. Surface high pressure is also favored over the
Southeast, which would advect Gulf moisture into the central and eastern
CONUS,
supporting increased chances for enhanced precipitation across portions of
Eastern CONUS. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20%
chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch
over
the Ohio Valley and Tennessee Valley. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is
highlighted across parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Ohio
Valley, and Tennessee Valley, July 17 to 19, which includes the aforementioned
areas highlighted by the reforecast tools as well as a broader region
indicated
by the uncalibrated ECMWF for increased chances of 3-day totals exceeding one
inch. Heavy precipitation is anticipated for week-1 across parts of the
Midwest. The Weather Prediction Center (WPC) 7-day accumulated totals for
parts
of Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri are predicted to reach or exceed 5 inches.
Expected heavy rainfall during week-2 is likely to lead to increased chances
of
flooding in the area. The possible flood risk area is expanded in today's
outlook, where the NWS Significant River Flood Outlook (for the next 5 days)
indicates possible flood river flooding.



There is good agreement in the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensembles favoring
mid-level ridging initially centered over the Four Corners region at the
beginning of the period, shifting to the northern half of the region by the
middle of the period. The anticipated ridge placement is most favorable for
monsoonal moisture from the middle to end of week-2, which is seen in the mean
daily precipitation accumulations in these model ensembles. Favorable mid-
level
ridge placement, in addition to tropical cyclone activity favored in the
eastern Pacific during week-2 and thermal low pressure over Baja California
triggering Gulf of California moisture surges, is likely to promote
above-normal rainfall across parts of the Desert Southwest. Both the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance for parts of the Desert
Southwest receiving 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and
half an inch, with the GEFS having a stronger wet signal than the ECMWF.
Although totals are not expected to exceed pre-defined hazard thresholds,
there
is a continued risk of locally heavy, convective rainfall over areas that are
experiencing extreme drought to elevate the potential for enhanced runoff
across the higher elevations into the valleys. Given the models' more
favorable
set up for favorable monsoonal moisture, the possible flood risk area is
slightly expanded in spatial coverage over Arizona compared to yesterday's
outlook.



Over western North America, mean surface high pressure remains forecast across
the northeastern Pacific, into parts of the Pacific Northwest, while mean
surface low pressure is anticipated over the Great Basin and Desert Southwest
during week-2. The strong mean pressure gradient situated over coastal
California increases chances for episodic high winds in the region, where both
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 35 mph during the early to middle portion of
week-2. A slight risk of high winds remains posted across coastal portions of
California for Jul 17-21.



Mid-level troughing is predicted for the North-Central Pacific into western
Alaska during week-2, supporting surface low formation over the Bering Sea and
western parts of Alaska from the beginning to middle of the period. The ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch, with the GEFS
reforecast tool keeping this precipitation more off the coast of southwestern
Alaska. The deterministic 6Z GFS shows some areas across western Alaska
(especially coastal areas) receiving over one inch of precipitation in a
24-hour period. Due to significant model uncertainty, a related heavy
precipitation hazard is not designated at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri July 09 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 15 - 19 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical model solutions forecast subtropical ridging across
the southwestern CONUS, with a trough centered near the Great Lakes. Ridging
and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are likely for the northeastern CONUS
ahead of this trough. Ensemble means from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models
show a persistent trough or closed low near the Alaska Panhandle. Above normal
heights are forecast across most of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians.

Enhanced probabilities of above normal temperatures are indicated across much
of the West and Northern Plains, under a predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. However, a cooling trend is likely for the Pacific Northwest
as the trough to the west is forecast to slowly progress eastward towards the
coast. Below normal temperatures are favored from Louisiana, extending
westward
to parts of the Southwest, underneath a predicted weakness in subtropical
ridging. Above normal temperatures are likely across the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic states ahead of a mean trough forecast over the Great Lakes.
Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle
associated with a persistent mid-level trough or closed low forecast nearby.
Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated across parts of
southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians underneath predicted above
normal heights and southerly low-level flow, while relatively cool surface
high
pressure forecast over parts of northern and eastern Mainland Alaska increase
chances of below normal temperatures on those areas.

Below normal precipitation chances are increased over the Aleutians and
Mainland Alaska under forecast near to above normal heights. Below normal
precipitation is likely for the northwestern CONUS into the Northern Plains,
under a predicted ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of
the
Southwest underneath a predicted weakness in the subtropical ridging and
increased monsoonal moisture. Enhanced probabilities of above normal
precipitation are indicated for parts of the Middle and Upper Mississippi
Valley, Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast, associated with a mean trough
predicted over the east-central CONUS. Conversely, a drier than normal pattern
is likely for parts of the coastal Southeast and Florida Panhandle underneath
predicted subtropical ridging.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 0z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 17 - 23 2021

During the week-2 period, 500-hPa ridging across the West is forecast to
strengthen and build northeastward over the Northern Plains. A mean trough is
forecast to shift eastward across the Great Lakes towards the Northeast. A
trough and associated below normal heights are forecast to progress eastward
and weaken during the week-2 period. However, the 7-day mean 500-hPa heights
near the Alaska Panhandle are still forecast to be below normal. Near to
slightly above normal heights are favored across the rest of Alaska ahead of a
trough forecast near the Bering Strait.

Above normal temperatures are favored to persist across much of the West.
However, the greatest confidence for increased heat shifts eastward to the
Northern Plains with time as the ridge is forecast to progress eastward during
the week-2 period. Negative temperature anomalies forecast during the early
part of the week-2 period leads to increased odds of below normal temperatures
for much of the Southern Plains as well as parts of the Southwest. As the
predicted trough progresses towards the Northeast, cooler temperatures are
expected across much of the eastern CONUS, decreasing the coverage of above
normal temperatures in the Northeast and increasing the area of near to below
normal temperatures from southern New England to the Southeast. Near to above
normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska as southerly low
level flow is forecast to increase throughout the period. Below normal
temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle near a predicted trough.

Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the northwestern and central
CONUS under an expansive ridge. Mean troughing predicted ahead of this ridge
leads to elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation from the Middle
and Upper Mississippi Valleys to the Northeast. Below normal precipitation is
slightly favored farther to the south, across parts of the Southeast coast and
Florida Peninsula, due to mean surface high pressure. The center of a
predicted
500-hPa ridge is forecast to be positioned favorably, near the Four Corners
region, for enhanced Monsoon moisture over parts of the Southwest, increasing
the likelihood of above normal precipitation there. As a predicted trough
progresses eastward across the Bering Sea, precipitation chances are expected
to increase for the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska, favoring above
normal precipitation in those areas. Near normal precipitation is favored for
the Alaskan Panhandle due to the nearby forecast trough weakening and 500-hPa
heights returning to near normal.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
fairly good agreement among dynamical model guidance.

FORECASTER: Mike C

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Post-Tropical Cyclone Elsa to exit the Northeast this evening,
with heavy rain and flash flooding remaining a concern along
coastal Maine...

...Flooding and severe storms possible for the Texas Gulf Coast
tonight and portions of the Midwest through Sunday...

...Record-breaking heat found throughout much of the West and
Southwest to intensify this weekend...


As of this afternoon, the center of Post-Tropical Cyclone Elsa was
located near Cape Cod, Massachusetts while racing toward the
northeast and the Canadian Maritimes. Additional rainfall amounts
of 2 to 4 inches, with locally higher totals, are expected along
coastal Maine through late this evening. Considerable flash
flooding will remain a concern for this region. Conditions will
drastically improve over the Northeast by Saturday morning, with
only a few isolated showers and thunderstorms possible throughout
southern New England.

Heavy rainfall will also be making weather headlines across the
Midwest and portions of the Texas Gulf Coast. A slow-moving
frontal boundary is expected to exist between the Ohio Valley and
Central Plains through this weekend, along with an anomalously
strong upper-level disturbance approaching from the Northern
Plains. This will aid in the development of multiple mesoscale
convective systems that could repeatedly affect the same general
areas, particularly from Iowa to Indiana where several inches of
rainfall will be possible along with numerous strong to severe
storms. The Storm Prediction Center has issued an Enhanced Risk
(level 3/5) of severe weather across southern Iowa, northeast
Missouri, and west-central Illinois valid through Saturday
morning. Damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes
are possible. Flash Flood Watches and a Moderate Risk of Excessive
Rainfall are also in effect throughout a similar region. The heavy
rain and severe storm threat is forecast to shift slightly south
and east by Sunday, as the system remains relatively stationary.
Potent storms and the potential for flash flooding are likely to
be found between the Ohio Valley and Deep South. Meanwhile, more
tropical downpours are expected this evening across southeast
Texas as moisture laden onshore flow in association with a weak
mid-level disturbance lingers over the region. Severe flooding has
already been an issue here, and the additional slow-moving
showers/storms will only aggravate the potential for more
flooding. The good news is that there should be an abatement in
the coverage of rainfall and intensity by Saturday morning and
beyond for the Texas Gulf Coast.

In the temperature department, excessive heat will continue across
much of the Western U.S. as daytime highs soar well above average
with highs well into the 90s for much of the Great Basin and
widespread 100+ degree readings for valley locations, with the
heat worsening across the Southwest by this weekend. Numerous
daily high temperature records could be in jeopardy of being
broken, particularly for California.  Highs could approach 115-120
degrees for the lower elevations of Arizona and eastern California
this weekend. A few notable temperature records at risk of falling
include Las Vegas, Nevada, where Saturday's high temperature is
forecast to come within one degree of the all-time high
temperature record (117F) set in 2015. Death Valley, California
may reach 130 degrees for only the 5th time on record, and the
all-time high temperature record (117F) for the state of Utah
could be reached on Saturday as well. Widespread Excessive Heat
Warning have been issued. For parts of the Great Basin and
Northern/Central Rockies, the combined hot and dry conditions may
lead to a critical risk of fire weather through the weekend,
particularly where Red Flag Warnings remain in effect between
Washington and Wyoming.

...Excessive Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat Mid-Later Next Week...


...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave now underway under upper ridging will continue for
the Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early-mid next week
with temperatures 10-20F above normal. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday/Wednesday in these
areas. The model consensus is leading to gradually lowering
heights with a developing modest northwest US trough, with the
highest heights shifting south into southern CA/AZ as more
progressive/flatter flow emerges over the U.S. northern tier.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may support above normal temperatures next week from the
Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the Northeast. This
includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate some potential for temperature
moderating showers/thunderstorms over the Southwest/Southern
Rockies next week with pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative
humidity in place to support diurnal activity with instability
peaking each afternoon/evening. However, this could also fuel
additional local downpour and terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is also a growing signal for the emergence of a multi-day
heavy rainfall/convective repeat pattern into the Midwest
Wednesday-Friday as shortwave energies reinforce upper troughing
over the north-central U.S. and as moisture and instability pool
along/ahead of a wavy front. Main focus may shift from the Upper
Midwest to the Mid-MS/OH Valleys with slow system translation.
This offers runoff threats with the region slated for chances of
heavy rainfall over short range time frames.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week remains low in a
slowly evolving pattern with a mean Midwest trough/low and the
western ridge gradually suppressing into southern Cal and vicinity
early next week. The WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a blend of well clustered guidance from the 06 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/NAEFS ensembles
along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad
composite maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate
smaller scale guidance differences, especially over time with
convective focus and for shortwave activity over the Northwest
coming into the mean Midwest trough. Latest 12 UTC guidance
overall still maintains this medium range solution.

...Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat Persists Into the Middle of Next
Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave now underway under upper ridging will continue for
the Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early-mid next week
with temperatures 10-15F above normal. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday in these areas. The
model consensus is leading to gradually lowering heights with a
developing modest northwest US trough, with the highest heights
shifting south into southern CA/AZ.  There is potential for
rebuilding heights across the northwest US as a closed low
develops off the west coast of Canada next Fri-Sat 17 July. Above
normal temperatures are expected across much of the northern Great
Basin, northern Rockies, and northern Plains next Fri 16 July- Sat
17 July.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may support above normal temperatures next week from the
Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the Northeast. This
includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies next week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
However, this could also lead to additional local downpour and
terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is also a persistent signal a multi-day stretch of episodes
of heavy rainfall in the Midwest that begins in the short range,
with more episodes occurring in the medium range Wednesday-Friday
as moisture and instability pool ahead of a wavy front. The models
still have rainfall maxima in Iowa/Missouri/Illinois Wed-Thu.,
with a shift into adjacent portions of the Mid-MS/OH Valleys Fri
16 July-Sat 17 July with slow frontal progression. This offers
excessive rainfall and resultant flooding threats where heavy
rainfall falls over short range time frames.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week remains low with
the exception of waves progressing through
the mean Midwest trough. The persistent differences between the
GFS, ECMWF and their ensemble means on the wave timing suggests
blending the operational and ensemble mean solutions until better

...Southwestern Heat Persists into Next Week...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat Persists Into the Middle of Next
Week...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The heat wave now underway under upper ridging will continue for
the Great Basin to CA and the Southwest into early-mid next week
with temperatures 10-15F above normal. Several daily high
temperature records are likely through Tuesday in these areas. The
model consensus is leading to gradually lowering heights with a
developing modest northwest US trough, with the highest heights
shifting south into southern CA/AZ.  There is potential for
rebuilding heights across the northwest US as a closed low
develops off the west coast of Canada next Fri-Sat 17 July. Above
normal temperatures are expected across much of the northern Great
Basin, northern Rockies, and northern Plains next Fri 16 July- Sat
17 July.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may support above normal temperatures next week from the
Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the Northeast. This
includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New
York City corridor.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies next week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
However, this could also lead to additional local downpour and
terrain enhancing runoff issues.

There is also a persistent signal a multi-day stretch of episodes
of heavy rainfall in the Midwest that begins in the short range,
with more episodes occurring in the medium range Wednesday-Friday
as moisture and instability pool ahead of a wavy front. The models
still have rainfall maxima in Iowa/Missouri/Illinois Wed-Thu.,
with a shift into adjacent portions of the Mid-MS/OH Valleys Fri
16 July-Sat 17 July with slow frontal progression. This offers
excessive rainfall and resultant flooding threats where heavy
rainfall falls over short range time frames.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Model and ensemble forecast spread into next week remains low with
the exception of waves progressing through
the mean Midwest trough. The persistent differences between the
GFS, ECMWF and their ensemble means on the wave timing suggests
blending the operational and ensemble mean solutions until better
clustering develops. The WPC medium range product suite was
primarily derived from a blend of guidance from the 18 UTC
GFS/GEFS, 12 UTC ECMWF/12z Canadian and ECMWF/GEFS ensembles along
with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. This broad composite
maintains good WPC continuity and acts to mitigate smaller scale
guidance differences.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0124 AM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge across the Four Corners will continue to
retrograde westward and intensify within the intermountain region
today. A belt of stronger mid-level winds will exist across the
Northwest. At the surface, high pressure off the West Coast will
combine with deepening thermal pressure troughs within the
California Central Valley northward into the Columbia Basin to
produce dry and breezy conditions. High pressure in the northern
Rockies will drive breezy north winds into parts of the eastern
Great Basin.

...Utah/southwestern Colorado...
Dry and windy north winds will reach 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
A few stronger gusts may occur as modestly enhanced mid-level winds
on the eastern flank of the upper-ridge will be present. RH could
fall as low as the single digits, though 5-15% will be more common.

...Columbia Basin...
Winds will be locally enhanced within the Columbia gaps as a surface
trough deepens in the Basin in response to strong heating. Winds of
15-20 mph are most likely, though 20-25 could briefly occur. The
overlap of these locally stronger winds with dry conditions will not
be substantial. However, 15-25% is likely from the terrain to the
immediately adjacent plains.

...San Joaquin Valley...
High pressure off the West Coast will combine with strong heating in
the Valley to drive 15-20 mph winds within a small portion of the
region. With RH of 15-20% during the afternoon, areas of elevated
fire weather risk may develop.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
While uncertainty exists with regard to storm initiation and
coverage due to an intensifying upper ridge, some potential exists
for lighting to occur in parts of the Sierra as well as into
southern Nevada. Storm motions will be slow and PWAT will be on the
high side which further precludes highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0208 AM CDT Sat Jul 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will remain across the Great Basin into parts of
the Southwest on Sunday. A shortwave trough will be favorably timed
with afternoon heating across parts of western Montana. At the
surface, the primary feature of interest will be thermal pressure
troughs within the intermountain region in response to strong
surface heating.

...Northern Nevada and southern Idaho...
Along with modest surface pressure gradient support, mid-level winds
will be enhanced on the northern flank of the upper-ridge. This will
especially be the case when the shortwave trough passes to the north
during the afternoon. This will lead to enhanced Zephyr winds in
northern portions of Nevada along with stronger winds in the Snake
River Plain. Winds will generally stay between 15-20 mph with RH
falling to 10-20%.

...Southwest Montana...
With the well-timed shortwave, thunderstorm development appears
probable in southwestern Montana during the afternoon. Relatively
fast storm motions and dry low levels will promote a risk for
isolated dry thunderstorms and an associated risk for lightning
ignitions in the present dry fuels.

...Flooding and strong storms expected for portions of the Midwest
and Central Plains...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. this weekend...

Now that Tropical Storm Elsa has exited the Northeast U.S., a more
pleasant weather pattern is expected across much of the
Mid-Atlantic and extending northward to New England on Saturday
with a cold front exiting the East Coast and a slightly
cooler/drier airmass settling in, with perhaps some lingering
showers near the coast on Saturday.  However, heavy rainfall will
be making weather headlines across much of the Midwest and
portions of the Ohio Valley this weekend.  A slow moving frontal
boundary is expected to exist between the central Appalachians and
central Plains through Sunday morning before lifting northward as
a warm front.  A well defined upper level trough will support the
development of an organized surface low across the Midwest, and
this will aid in the development of multiple mesoscale convective
systems that could repeatedly affect the same general areas,
particularly from Missouri to central Kentucky where several
inches of rainfall will be possible along with numerous strong to
severe storms.  In addition, the Storm Prediction Center has an
Enhanced Risk of severe storms across portions of Oklahoma,
Missouri, and Arkansas for Saturday.

In the temperature department, excessive heat will continue across
much of the Western U.S. as daytime highs soar well above normal
with highs well into the 90s for much of the Great Basin and
widespread 100+ degree readings for valley locations.  Numerous
daily high temperature records could be in jeopardy of being
broken, particularly for California and Nevada.  Highs could
approach 115-120 degrees for the lower elevations of Arizona and
eastern California this weekend!  For parts of the Great Basin and
Northern/Central Rockies, the combined hot and dry conditions may
lead to an elevated risk for fire weather through Sunday,
particularly where Red Flag Warnings remain in effect between
northern California and Wyoming.  Meanwhile, temperatures will be
comfortable for this time of year from the Dakotas to the Midwest
this weekend.

..Early heavy rain near the North Carolina coast should edge
slowly out to sea today...

...Heat returns to the Desert Southwest and Interior Pacific
Northwest today while the central Plains to the East Coast see
below normal temperatures...

A mid- to upper-level ridge building from the Southwest into the
Pacific Northwest will continue to spread drier conditions across
the interior sections of the West Coast while shifting the most
active monsoonal showers further eastward from the central and
southern Rockies into the High Plains today.  Locally heavy rain
is possible early today over the southern Rockies/High Plains
before diminishing later today.  Meanwhile, the drying trend
brought by the building ridge will lead to above average
temperatures across the Desert Southwest northward to the interior
Pacific Northwest.  High temperatures in the 110s will be common
in the Desert Southwest for the next couple of days while upper
90s to 100 degrees are forecast for the interior Pacific Northwest
this afternoon.  As a result, Excessive Heat Warnings are in
effect for the Desert Southwest through Thursday evening while a
Heat Advisory is in effect for today across interior Pacific
Northwest.  In addition, fire weather danger is forecast to
increase over the Great Basin into Thursday as the dry conditions
settle in.  A system moving east from the Pacific will begin to
bring cooler air into the Pacific Northwest on Thursday as the
heat spreads further east into the northern Plains and upper
Midwest where high temperatures are forecast to reach into the 80s
and 90s the next couple of days.

Meanwhile, a frontal boundary is forecast to remain nearly
stationary near/along the Gulf Coast and along/just off the East
Coast for the next few days.  An axis of heavy rain is forecast to
stretch along or just east of the stationary front along the East
Coast.  The heaviest rain should stay just off the coast as heavy
rain near the North Carolina coast should edge slowly out to sea
today.

Elsewhere, below normal temperatures are expected from the Central
Plains to the East Coast, with highs mainly in the 80s. Portions
of the Carolinas under the influence of clouds and precipitation
as well as New England will see highs only in the 70s. The dry
airmass will also allow temperatures to cool off at night, with
lows dipping down into the 60s from north Texas and Oklahoma east
to the Mid-Atlantic and coastal Northeast and lows in the 50s for
the interior Northeast.

Heat Advisories are in effect for today across interior Pacific
Northwest.  In addition, fire weather danger is forecast to
increase over the Great Basin into Thursday.  A system moving east
from the Pacific will begin to bring cooler air into the Pacific
Northwest on Thursday together with a round of rain/thunderstorms
eastward into the northern Rockies.  The rain/storms are expected
to continue across the northern Rockies into early Friday as the
heat spreads further east into the northern Plains and upper
Midwest where high temperatures are forecast to reach into the 80s
and 90s the next couple of days.

Meanwhile, a frontal boundary is forecast to remain nearly
stationary near/along the Gulf Coast as well as along/just off the
East Coast for the next few days.  An axis of heavy rain is
forecast to extend along or just east of the boundary near the
East Coast.  The heaviest rainfall should stay just off the coast
as the heavy rain early this morning near the North Carolina coast
is forecast to edge slowly out to sea later today.  However, a
slight westward shift of the front would bring the heavy rain back
along/near the coast at any time.  Some heavy rainfall is also
possible across northern Florida just south of the front.
Meanwhile, the heaviest rains should stay off the Gulf Coast but
some enhanced rainfall is expected farther westward across
southern Texas for the next couple of days.

Elsewhere, below normal temperatures are expected from the central
Plains to the East Coast, with highs mainly in the 80s.  The dry
airmass will also allow temperatures to cool off at night, with
lows dipping down into the 60s from north Texas and Oklahoma east

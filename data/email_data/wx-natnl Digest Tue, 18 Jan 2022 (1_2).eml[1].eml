Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0958 AM CST Mon Jan 17 2022

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with modest
changes made to the Elevated highlights to reflect the latest
guidance consensus.

..Squitieri.. 01/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0101 AM CST Mon Jan 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
Modest northwesterly flow across the Rockies will promote weak lee
troughing in the southern High Plains. Winds will generally remain
light, around 15 mph, though locally higher speeds of near 20 mph
may occur. The airmass within the region will remain quite dry and
10-20% RH will be possible by the afternoon. Elevated fire weather
is forecast due to dry fuels. Fire weather concerns across the rest
of the CONUS appear minimal.

...Snow/ice are possible along the Eastern Seaboard late this week
and weekend on the eastern periphery of an Arctic high...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front across the East late
this week, leading to very cold temperatures across the central
and eastern CONUS. Moist air spilling into the southern and
eastern periphery of the chilly airmass could produce wintry
weather with light amounts over Texas Thursday to currently better
chances for notable amounts over the Carolinas and into the
Mid-Atlantic late this week, possibly spreading into the Northeast
this weekend, though uncertainty remains high with the details
given model guidance disagreements. Meanwhile, upper ridging is
expected for the West, with the exception of a shortwave digging
south that may produce a closed low over the Southwest this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z suite of model guidance begins the period Thursday
with fairly good agreement for the overall pattern--upper
troughing across the central and eastern U.S. with a strong Arctic
high at the surface, and a high over the eastern Pacific with a
ridge axis into the West. A couple of shortwaves that are
significant to the pattern then have somewhat low predictability
Friday and beyond. In the East, a shortwave moving through the
persistent eastern trough shows considerable differences in
placement and strength by late Friday into Saturday through the
Ohio Valley to Eastern Seaboard, which produces placement
differences with a potentially impactful surface low in the
western Atlantic. The 00Z and incoming 12Z ECMWF are generally on
the western side of the model spread with these features, leading
to more precipitation over the Eastern Seaboard, while the GFS
runs have been suppressed farther east into the Atlantic. The 00Z
cluster analysis and ensemble member low plots showed that the
GEFS and EC ensembles followed their operational runs, with GEFS
members farther east than EC ensemble members. Tended to favor a
position for the surface low near the 00Z EC ensemble mean as
somewhat of a compromise, which was not too far off from the 00Z
CMC position, but the 12Z CMC is now showing a more suppressed
pattern. This forecast approach led to a trend west of the
previous WPC forecast with the surface low and frontal placement,
but not nearly to the western extent of the ECMWF runs.

Meanwhile in the West, models all tend to show shortwave energy
coming into British Columbia Thursday with at least a portion of
the energy diving south across the Intermountain West Friday, and
could close off a southern stream low in the Southwest by around
Saturday. There has been good model agreement for a couple cycles
now for the low to close off at some point this weekend (recent
12Z guidance is showing later compared to the 00Z/06Z guidance),
so felt it was prudent to include a closed low for the forecast
update, but there is inherent uncertainty as the shortwave energy
is stemming from the data-poor Pacific Ocean.

Early next week, guidance all shows troughing remaining strong
across the East given a deep low centered just east of the Hudson
Bay, but with some variations in shortwaves around it. The WPC
forecast was based on a blend of deterministic guidance early on,
including and increasing weighting of the GEFS and especially the
EC ensemble guidance as the period progressed.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A massive Arctic high will spread from the central to eastern U.S.
Thursday through Saturday behind a potent cold front, producing
much below normal temperatures. Lows of 15-25F below average are
likely across the north-central U.S. Thursday and Friday morning
and across the interior Northeast Friday and Saturday. Lows in the
teens are likely as far south as Texas, while in parts of the
Midwest temperatures could stay below 0F even for highs on
Thursday. High temperatures should be 20-30F below normal for the
Plains to the Eastern Seaboard late this week before moderating
early next week. On the southern and eastern periphery of this
high, moist air spilling into the cold air could lead to wintry
weather on the northern periphery of precipitation spreading
across the Gulf Coast states and then possibly up the Eastern
Seaboard. Once again, uncertainty with the evolution of shortwaves
and surface lows leads to low confidence in placement of wintry
precipitation and precipitation type in some locations at this
time, but the current forecast shows the potential for notable
snow, sleet, and freezing rain particularly in the Carolinas and
southern portions of the Mid-Atlantic for the latter part of the
week, with some chance of spreading into the Northeast this
weekend. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow
given cold air in place and generally westerly winds.

In the West, the best chance for precipitation will be Thursday
and Friday with mountain snow in the Rockies as the shortwave
impulse moves through. Other than that, conditions should remain
mostly dry, with slightly warmer than normal conditions along the
West coast underneath the ridge, and above normal temperatures are
then expected for the High Plains early next week.

...Snow/ice are possible along the Eastern Seaboard late this week
and weekend on the eastern periphery of an Arctic high...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front across the East late
this week, leading to very cold temperatures across the central
and eastern CONUS. Moist air spilling into the southern and
eastern periphery of the chilly airmass could produce wintry
weather with light amounts over Texas Thursday to currently better
chances for notable amounts over the Carolinas and into the
Mid-Atlantic late this week, possibly spreading into the Northeast
this weekend, though uncertainty remains high with the details
given model guidance disagreements. Meanwhile, upper ridging is
expected for the West, with the exception of a shortwave digging
south that may produce a closed low over the Southwest this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z suite of model guidance begins the period Thursday
with fairly good agreement for the overall pattern--upper
troughing across the central and eastern U.S. with a strong Arctic
high at the surface, and a high over the eastern Pacific with a
ridge axis into the West. A couple of shortwaves that are
significant to the pattern then have somewhat low predictability
Friday and beyond. In the East, a shortwave moving through the
persistent eastern trough shows considerable differences in
placement and strength by late Friday into Saturday through the
Ohio Valley to Eastern Seaboard, which produces placement
differences with a potentially impactful surface low in the
western Atlantic. The 00Z and incoming 12Z ECMWF are generally on
the western side of the model spread with these features, leading
to more precipitation over the Eastern Seaboard, while the GFS
runs have been suppressed farther east into the Atlantic. The 00Z
cluster analysis and ensemble member low plots showed that the
GEFS and EC ensembles followed their operational runs, with GEFS
members farther east than EC ensemble members. Tended to favor a
position for the surface low near the 00Z EC ensemble mean as
somewhat of a compromise, which was not too far off from the 00Z
CMC position, but the 12Z CMC is now showing a more suppressed
pattern. This forecast approach led to a trend west of the
previous WPC forecast with the surface low and frontal placement,
but not nearly to the western extent of the ECMWF runs.

Meanwhile in the West, models all tend to show shortwave energy
coming into British Columbia Thursday with at least a portion of
the energy diving south across the Intermountain West Friday, and
could close off a southern stream low in the Southwest by around
Saturday. There has been good model agreement for a couple cycles
now for the low to close off at some point this weekend (recent
12Z guidance is showing later compared to the 00Z/06Z guidance),
so felt it was prudent to include a closed low for the forecast
update, but there is inherent uncertainty as the shortwave energy
is stemming from the data-poor Pacific Ocean.

Early next week, guidance all shows troughing remaining strong
across the East given a deep low centered just east of the Hudson
Bay, but with some variations in shortwaves around it. The WPC
forecast was based on a blend of deterministic guidance early on,
including and increasing weighting of the GEFS and especially the
EC ensemble guidance as the period progressed.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A massive Arctic high will spread from the central to eastern U.S.
Thursday through Saturday behind a potent cold front, producing
much below normal temperatures. Lows of 15-25F below average are
likely across the north-central U.S. Thursday and Friday morning
and across the interior Northeast Friday and Saturday. Lows in the
teens are likely as far south as Texas, while in parts of the
Midwest temperatures could stay below 0F even for highs on
Thursday. High temperatures should be 20-30F below normal for the
Plains to the Eastern Seaboard late this week before moderating
early next week. On the southern and eastern periphery of this
high, moist air spilling into the cold air could lead to wintry
weather on the northern periphery of precipitation spreading
across the Gulf Coast states and then possibly up the Eastern
Seaboard. Once again, uncertainty with the evolution of shortwaves
and surface lows leads to low confidence in placement of wintry
precipitation and precipitation type in some locations at this
time, but the current forecast shows the potential for notable
snow, sleet, and freezing rain particularly in the Carolinas and
southern portions of the Mid-Atlantic for the latter part of the
week, with some chance of spreading into the Northeast this
weekend. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow
given cold air in place and generally westerly winds.

In the West, the best chance for precipitation will be Thursday
and Friday with mountain snow in the Rockies as the shortwave
impulse moves through. Other than that, conditions should remain
mostly dry, with slightly warmer than normal conditions along the
West coast underneath the ridge, and above normal temperatures are
then expected for the High Plains early next week.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS ROLLING
PLAINS AND BIG COUNTRY...

Portions of the Texas Rolling Plains into the Big Country have been
upgraded to Critical for tomorrow/Tuesday afternoon. Ahead of the
surface cold front, sustained westerly surface winds over 20 mph
(with higher gusts) are expected to overspread critically dry fuels
for at least a few hours around afternoon peak heating. Forecast
ERCs will likely exceed 90 percent in many areas, coincident with
100 hour fuel moisture percentages in the single digits. Modest 850
mb moisture is expected to usher in from the west, which will mix
down to the surface across eastern New Mexico into the Caprock and
support RH just over 20 percent (hence the maintenance of Elevated
highlights). However, while RH may only dip to 15-20 percent across
the Texas Rolling Plains/Big Country, the strong winds and very dry
fuels are expected to compensate to support wildfire-spread
potential typical of low-end Critical environments, favoring the
introduction of Critical highlights.

..Squitieri.. 01/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CST Mon Jan 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper low off the coast of California will transition into
an open wave and move into the Southwest on Tuesday. This feature is
forecast to help deepen a lee trough/cyclone in the Texas
Panhandle/South Plains vicinity. Farther north, a more potent upper
trough will move into the northern Plains with an attendant cold
front moving southward to near the Red River by Wednesday morning.

...East-central New Mexico into Texas South Plains and Rolling
Plains...
Surface winds will increase during the day and into the afternoon as
the surface low deepens in response to the approaching upper trough.
Sustained winds could reach 20-25 mph. Flow within the lowest 2 km
will also be moderately strong and support wind gusts up to 30-35
mph. RH remains a bit uncertain during the afternoon. All models
show an increase in 850-700 mb moisture during the day and a
subsequent impact on low-level RH. RH of 15-20% appears most
probable, but locally lower values could occur. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather is expected during the afternoon given the dry
fuels.

...Central High Plains...
A brief window of elevated conditions is possible behind the cold
front. The colder air will lag the wind shift and RH may dip to
around 15% in some locations. Winds between 15-20 mph are most
likely. Areas of dry fuels will support fire spread.

...Major winter storm begins to exit the Northeast; blustery
conditions continue into Tuesday with lake-effect snows...

Tuesday ahead of an Alberta clipper...

...Snow spreading into the northern Rockies/High Plains on Tuesday
followed by arctic air intrusion down the Plains on Wednesday...

A deep low pressure system responsible for the most recent winter
storm in the eastern U.S. and severe weather in Florida is
forecast to move farther into southeastern Canada on Tuesday.  The
remaining heavy snow is northern Maine is expected to taper off
and change over to mixed precipitation or wet snow by this
evening.  Much of the rest of the interior Northeast will see the
snow becoming more scattered tonight Other than the tendency for
lake-effect snows to linger downwind of the lower Great Lakes, the
snow across the Northeast should gradually taper off on Tuesday.
However, due to the size of the departing storm, blustery
conditions are expected to continue into Tuesday for much of the
Northeast.

Meanwhile, a cold front across southern Canada will dip toward the
northern Plains.  An Alberta clipper is forecast to form on the
front on Monday and then move toward the Great Lakes on Tuesday.
Lingering snow across the Great Lakes will pick up in intensity on
Tuesday as the clipper approaches.  Farther west, accumulating
snow is also forecast across northern Minnesota and northeastern
North Dakota.  Arctic air behind the cold front will then surge
into the northern Plains on Tuesday.  Upslope snow is forecast to
develop and intensify over the northern High Plains into the
northern Rockies on Tuesday as an arctic high pressure system
slides down from western Canada.  This arctic plunge will bring
sub-zero temperatures into the northern Plains a Wednesday.  By
later on Wednesday, rain is forecast to blossom across the Deep
South to Tennessee ahead of a developing low pressure system.

Weak onshore flow will produce light rain over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and some snow at the higher elevations from late
Monday afternoon into late Tuesday night. In addition, overnight
Tuesday, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to
pool along the boundary over the eastern portion of the front,
developing rain over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and the
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley.

On another note, Monday, warm temperatures, gusty wind, and dry
fuels have led to an area of Elevated Risk of fire weather over
parts of the Southern High Plains and the Southern Rockies.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 23 - 27 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. Mean troughing is forecast over
eastern Siberia while strong ridging looks to dominate downstream across mo=
st
of western North America. Daily model output indicates a very stable patter=
n
for the early and middle parts of the 6-10 day period but some hints of cha=
nge
are evident by day 10. Near the end of the period, a trough is forecast to
progress eastward off the West Coast which may act to weaken the ridge over
western North America. However, strong ridging is forecast to remain over t=
he
North Atlantic, which would act to lock an amplified trough in place over
eastern North America, casting doubt on the potential of any significant
height
falls upstream across the West. The official 500-hPa manual height blend,
based
primarily on an even split among the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble mea=
ns,
maintains strong negative height anomalies across eastern North America and
above normal heights for most of Alaska and the western CONUS.

With strong troughing forecast across central and eastern North America,
probabilities of below normal temperatures are elevated across most of the
eastern half of the CONUS and along the Southern Tier from the Rio Grande
Valley eastward. With a snowpack in place, confidence in below normal
temperatures is particularly high for parts of the southern Appalachians,
where
probabilities of below normal temperatures exceed 80 percent. Conversely, m=
ean
ridging expected across western North America leads to increased probabilit=
ies
of above normal temperatures for most of Alaska and parts of the western
CONUS.
Daily model output is currently producing a very strong warm signal for muc=
h
of
Mainland Alaska through at least the middle of the period, leading to above
normal temperature probabilities exceeding 70 percent for parts of the stat=
e.
Conversely, despite predicted ridging and above normal heights, near normal
temperatures are favored for much of the Great Basin, due to the potential =
for
cold air inversions associated with predicted strong surface high pressure.

With a cold, stable air mass in place, below normal precipitation is likely
across much of the Central and Southern Plains eastward to the Appalachians
and
parts of the interior Northeast and eastern Great Lakes. Probabilities of n=
ear
to above normal precipitation are elevated across the Rio Grande Valley
eastward to the Gulf Coast Region, near the base of the expansive trough
forecast over eastern North America, and for the immediate East Coast, ahea=
d
of
the predicted mean trough axis. Above normal precipitation is also slightly
favored across parts of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes as weak
disturbances may affect these regions. Additionally, mean low level winds a=
re
favorable for lake effect snow downwind of the western Great Lakes.
Conversely,
a dry pattern is likely for the western CONUS as strong ridging is forecast=
 to
dominate. Above normal precipitation is favored for most of Alaska, ahead o=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted highly amplified mean pattern.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 25 - 31 2022

A highly amplified 500-hPa pattern is forecast to persist across the foreca=
st
domain for week-2, with below normal heights likely across central and east=
ern
North America and above normal heights favored for Alaska and the western
CONUS. However, daily model output reveals a complex pattern across the
Pacific
Sector and some solutions, particularly the ECMWF ensemble mean, weakens th=
e
ridge over the West Coast of North America and builds a second ridge farthe=
r
to
the west near western Alaska later in week-2. Should this second ridge come=
 to
fruition, a pattern change may ensue, with increased troughing over the wes=
t
and corresponding height rises over the Southeast. However, ridging is
generally forecast to hold strong over the North Atlantic, which would
maintain
troughing over eastern North America and more ridging upstream across the
West.
This Atlantic ridge teleconnects well with a second ridge forecast over
east-central Asia and generally agrees with MJO composites, with the caveat
that the MJO signal is currently weak and unreliable. The mean 500-hPa blen=
d,
composed from the ensemble mean solutions form the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadia=
n
models, maintains troughing over eastern North America and ridging across
Alaska and the western CONUS.

With a highly amplified pattern generally expected to continue for Week-2,
below normal temperatures remain favored for the eastern half of the CONUS.
Probabilities of below normal temperatures exceed 70 percent for the southe=
rn
Appalachians, near the predicted trough axis and where the associated mean
negative height anomalies are forecast to be the strongest. Conversely,
forecast ridging leads to elevated probabilities of above normal temperatur=
es
across much of the southwestern CONUS. A broad region of enhanced near norm=
al
temperature probabilities are indicated for the northwestern CONUS, as
uncertainty is high as to if, and by how much, ridging over this area will
weaken during week-2. Ridging predicted across Alaska favors above normal
temperatures across most of the state.

Surface high pressure associated with a cold, stable air mass in the East a=
nd
strong ridging across the West, favors a dry pattern across most of the CON=
US.
However, weak disturbances are possible for parts of the Northern High Plai=
ns,
leading to slightly elevated probabilities for above normal precipitation f=
or
this region. Slightly elevated probabilities of near to above normal
precipitation are indicated for much of the southern tier of the CONUS and =
for
parts of eastern New England, along the periphery of the large scale trough
predicted over eastern North America. Near normal precipitation is also
slightly favored along the West Coast of the CONUS, as uncertainty is high =
due
to conflicting signals among dynamical and statistical guidance. Above norm=
al
precipitation probabilities are enhanced for most of Alaska, as mean
southwesterly mid-level flow is predicted across much of the state.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=

In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=

"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

However, due to the size of the departing storm, blustery

forecast to move toward the Great Lakes on Tuesday.  Lingering
snow across the Great Lakes will pick up in intensity on Tuesday
as the clipper approaches, with accumulating snow expected across

an arctic high pressure system slides down from western Canada.
This arctic plunge will bring sub-zero temperatures into the
northern Plains on Wednesday.  By Wednesday, rain is forecast to
blossom across the Deep South to Tennessee ahead of a developing
low pressure system.  The rain will begin to spread into the
Appalachians later that day as showers and thunderstorms are
expected to develop near the western Gulf Coast region ahead of
the arctic cold front.  Meanwhile, some snow will move across the
lower Great Lakes toward northern New England ahead of the clipper
system.  Snow is also in the forecast across the central High
Plains on Wednesday.

Weak onshore flow will produce light rain over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and some snow at the higher elevations which
will continue through Wednesday as the next warm front approaches
from the Pacific.  Farther south, a lingering upper-level low off
Baja California will bring some light precipitation from southern
California through the Desert Southwest and into the southern
Rockies during the next couple of days.

On another note, warm temperatures, gusty winds, and dry fuels
will promote fire weather threat for parts of the southern High
Plains prior to the arrival of the arctic front.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST January 17 2022

SYNOPSIS: An amplified 500-hPa pattern forecast during week-2 with a mean
trough through eastern North America enhances the likelihood for much below
normal temperatures across the eastern half of the country. The trough axis
should move eastward with time, restricting enhanced chances for much below
normal temperatures to parts of the Appalachians and East Coast after the
first
few days of week-2. As surface high pressure shifts eastward along with the
eastern North American trough, the return flow may boost southerly winds
beyond
hazards thresholds during the last half of the period. Farther west, a broa=
d
mid-level ridge centered south to southwest of Alaska will bring strong
southwesterly surface winds to the lower reaches of the state, with high wi=
nds
hazards possible over parts of near-coastal southern Alaska and the interio=
r
Southwest. The 500-hPa is expected to slowly de-amplify later in the period=
,
ending all hazards risks except for high winds in parts of the south-centra=

Plains as milder air continues flowing into the region.

FOR TUESDAY JANUARY 25 - MONDAY JANUARY 31: Models are in fairly good
agreement
on the predicted mean mid-level height pattern for week-2, but details on
individual weather systems and the late-period easing of the mean eastern
CONUS
mid-level trough are less consistent among the models, making the hazards
forecast less certain after the middle of week-2.



All models agree on a fairly strong 500-hPa trough being well-established o=
ver
eastern North America as week-2 starts. As a result, the period begins with
cold weather entrenched across much of the East. The best chances for much
below normal temperatures at the start of week-2 are in portions of the upp=
er
Midwest and Great Lakes Region, and also across the central Appalachians an=
d
much of the east-central Atlantic Coast. The mean trough should slowly move
eastward with time, dragging cold surface high pressure eastward. This ends
enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures west of the Appalachian=
s
by
the middle of week-2, but cold air will stay in place farther east for an
additional couple of days, as they will be closer to the relaxing and
eastward-moving 500-hPa https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://trough.As__;!!K5=
43PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNe0SNMYc$  =
a result, a second high risk area is
designated over the east-central CONUS for Jan 25 to 28. Deamplification of
the
mid-level pattern should begin late week-2, ending the cold weather threat.
Because of differences among the models in how this transition takes place,=
 no
specific heavy-precipitation hazards can be determined at this time, but su=
ch
development is possible somewhere east of the Mississippi River through mid=
dle
week-2.



In the central states, as the surface high pressure shifts off the East Coa=
st,
return flow is expected to bring milder air into the south-central Plains b=
y
the middle of the period . Reforecast guidance indicates increased chances =
of
winds exceeding the 85th percentile, supporting a slight risk of high winds
for
 the last half of week-2

The amplified pattern at the start of week-2 will also feature an amplified

reaching hazards thresholds during the early to middle part of week-2 befor=

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST January 17 2022

SYNOPSIS: An amplified 500-hPa pattern forecast during week-2 with a mean
trough through eastern North America enhances the likelihood for much below
normal temperatures across the eastern half of the country. The trough axis
should move eastward with time, restricting enhanced chances for much below
normal temperatures to parts of the Appalachians and East Coast after the
first
few days of week-2. As surface high pressure shifts eastward along with the
eastern North American trough, the return flow may boost southerly winds
beyond
hazards thresholds during the last half of the period. Farther west, a broa=
d
mid-level ridge centered south to southwest of Alaska will bring strong
southwesterly surface winds to the lower reaches of the state, with high wi=
nds
hazards possible over parts of near-coastal southern Alaska and the interio=
r
Southwest. The 500-hPa is expected to slowly de-amplify later in the period=
,
ending all hazards risks except for high winds in parts of the south-centra=
l
Plains as milder air continues flowing into the region.

FOR TUESDAY JANUARY 25 - MONDAY JANUARY 31: Models are in fairly good
agreement
on the predicted mean mid-level height pattern for week-2, but details on
individual weather systems and the late-period easing of the mean eastern
CONUS
mid-level trough are less consistent among the models, making the hazards
forecast less certain after the middle of week-2.



All models agree on a fairly strong 500-hPa trough being well-established o=
ver
eastern North America as week-2 starts. As a result, the period begins with
cold weather entrenched across much of the East. The best chances for much
below normal temperatures at the start of week-2 are in portions of the upp=
er
Midwest and Great Lakes Region, and also across the central Appalachians an=
d
much of the east-central Atlantic Coast. The mean trough should slowly move
eastward with time, dragging cold surface high pressure eastward. This ends
enhanced chances for much below normal temperatures west of the Appalachian=
s
by
the middle of week-2, but cold air will stay in place farther east for an
additional couple of days, as they will be closer to the relaxing and
eastward-moving 500-hPa https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://trough.As__;!!K5=
43PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNe0SNMYc$  =
a result, a second high risk area is
designated over the east-central CONUS for Jan 25 to 28. Deamplification of
the
mid-level pattern should begin late week-2, ending the cold weather threat.
Because of differences among the models in how this transition takes place,=
 no
specific heavy-precipitation hazards can be determined at this time, but su=
ch
development is possible somewhere east of the Mississippi River through mid=
dle
week-2.



In the central states, as the surface high pressure shifts off the East Coa=
st,
return flow is expected to bring milder air into the south-central Plains b=
y
the middle of the period . Reforecast guidance indicates increased chances =
of
winds exceeding the 85th percentile, supporting a slight risk of high winds
for
 the last half of week-2

The amplified pattern at the start of week-2 will also feature an amplified
ridge ranging from the north Pacific Ocean to western North America. This w=

Valid 12Z Thu Jan 20 2022 - 12Z Mon Jan 24 2022

...Snow/ice are possible along the Eastern Seaboard late this week
and weekend on the eastern periphery of an Arctic high...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front across the East late
this week, leading to very cold temperatures across the central
and eastern CONUS. Moist air spilling into the southern and
eastern periphery of the chilly airmass could produce wintry
weather with light amounts over Texas Thursday to currently better
chances for notable amounts over the Carolinas and into the
Mid-Atlantic late this week, possibly spreading into the Northeast
this weekend, though uncertainty remains high with the details
given model guidance disagreements. Meanwhile, upper ridging is
expected for the West, with the exception of a shortwave digging
south that may produce a closed low over the Southwest this
weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z suite of model guidance begins the period Thursday
with fairly good agreement for the overall pattern--upper
troughing across the central and eastern U.S. with a strong Arctic
high at the surface, and a high over the eastern Pacific with a
ridge axis into the West. A couple of shortwaves that are
significant to the pattern then have somewhat low predictability
Friday and beyond. In the East, a shortwave moving through the
persistent eastern trough shows considerable differences in
placement and strength by late Friday into Saturday through the
Ohio Valley to Eastern Seaboard, which produces placement
differences with a potentially impactful surface low in the
western Atlantic. The 00Z and incoming 12Z ECMWF are generally on
the western side of the model spread with these features, leading
to more precipitation over the Eastern Seaboard, while the GFS
runs have been suppressed farther east into the Atlantic. The 00Z
cluster analysis and ensemble member low plots showed that the
GEFS and EC ensembles followed their operational runs, with GEFS
members farther east than EC ensemble members. Tended to favor a
position for the surface low near the 00Z EC ensemble mean as
somewhat of a compromise, which was not too far off from the 00Z
CMC position, but the 12Z CMC is now showing a more suppressed
pattern. This forecast approach led to a trend west of the
previous WPC forecast with the surface low and frontal placement,
but not nearly to the western extent of the ECMWF runs.

Meanwhile in the West, models all tend to show shortwave energy
coming into British Columbia Thursday with at least a portion of
the energy diving south across the Intermountain West Friday, and
could close off a southern stream low in the Southwest by around
Saturday. There has been good model agreement for a couple cycles
now for the low to close off at some point this weekend (recent
12Z guidance is showing later compared to the 00Z/06Z guidance),
so felt it was prudent to include a closed low for the forecast
update, but there is inherent uncertainty as the shortwave energy
is stemming from the data-poor Pacific Ocean.

Early next week, guidance all shows troughing remaining strong
across the East given a deep low centered just east of the Hudson
Bay, but with some variations in shortwaves around it. The WPC
forecast was based on a blend of deterministic guidance early on,
including and increasing weighting of the GEFS and especially the
EC ensemble guidance as the period progressed.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A massive Arctic high will spread from the central to eastern U.S.
Thursday through Saturday behind a potent cold front, producing
much below normal temperatures. Lows of 15-25F below average are
likely across the north-central U.S. Thursday and Friday morning
and across the interior Northeast Friday and Saturday. Lows in the
teens are likely as far south as Texas, while in parts of the
Midwest temperatures could stay below 0F even for highs on
Thursday. High temperatures should be 20-30F below normal for the
Plains to the Eastern Seaboard late this week before moderating
early next week. On the southern and eastern periphery of this
high, moist air spilling into the cold air could lead to wintry
weather on the northern periphery of precipitation spreading
across the Gulf Coast states and then possibly up the Eastern
Seaboard. Once again, uncertainty with the evolution of shortwaves
and surface lows leads to low confidence in placement of wintry
precipitation and precipitation type in some locations at this
time, but the current forecast shows the potential for notable
snow, sleet, and freezing rain particularly in the Carolinas and
southern portions of the Mid-Atlantic for the latter part of the
week, with some chance of spreading into the Northeast this
weekend. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow
given cold air in place and generally westerly winds.

In the West, the best chance for precipitation will be Thursday
and Friday with mountain snow in the Rockies as the shortwave
impulse moves through. Other than that, conditions should remain
mostly dry, with slightly warmer than normal conditions for the
West Coast states underneath the ridge, and above normal
temperatures are then expected for the High Plains early next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0100 AM CST Tue Jan 18 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE ROLLING PLAINS OF NORTHWEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level disturbance, currently noted over southern California
in early-morning water-vapor imagery, is forecast to translate
eastward towards the southern Plains through the day. Strengthening
zonal flow over the southern Rockies associated with this wave will
deepen a surface low currently over the OK/TX Panhandles. A
combination of a surface mass response and strengthening mid-level
flow will support a swath of 15-25 mph winds from eastern NM into
north-central TX and southwest OK. Boundary-layer mixing up to
around 850 mb should support wind gusts between 25-35 mph.

00Z AMA and MAF soundings reveal a 1-3 km deep dry layer, and
widespread dewpoints in the single digits/low teens across east
NM/west TX suggest this dry air mass is fairly widespread. While
modest moisture advection from the south is expected, westerly
downslope winds will help maintain dry conditions across the TX
Panhandle into northwest TX. Latest guidance suggests RH reductions
to near 20% will be common west of a diffuse dryline, and a few
locations may see RH values fall into the teens by late afternoon.
Critical wind/RH conditions appear most likely to occur across the
Rolling Plains of northwest TX, where diurnal warming under the
low-level thermal ridge axis should be most favorably overlapped
with strong low/mid-level flow. Outside of this region, breezy
conditions with modestly dry RH are expected, and transient critical
conditions may occur. To the northwest across the TX Panhandle, RH
reductions into the teens appear likely, but winds should be
somewhat weaker under the nearly stationary surface low. Latest fuel
guidance continues to show region ERC values in the 80-90th
percentile for mid-January, indicating receptive fuels that will
support the fire weather threat.

...Heavy Snow/Ice Threat for the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
into Friday/Saturday...

...Overview...

Arctic high pressure will push a cold front through the Deep South
and East later this week, leading to much below normal
temperatures. Moist air fed into the southern and eastern
periphery of the cold airmass is increasingly likely to fuel a
heavy snow/ice threat from the Southeast to the Mid-Atlantic into
Fri. Potential coastal storm development would enhance Mid-Atlanic
to Northeast heavy snow potential Sat. Meanwhile, upper ridging
builds off/along the West Coast as digging Intermoutain
West/Rockies shortwave energy spills snows southward in route to
producing a Southwest closed low by the weekend slated to eject
across the U.S. southern tier early next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Weather
Highlights/Threats...

Guidance remains in decent agreement with the large scale mean
flow over the lower 48 highlighted by an upper ridge off/along the
West Coast and upper troughing over the central and eastern U.S..
However, the models have recently been horrendous with run to run
continuity with embedded shortwaves that dig through the mean
upper trough position. In particular, forecast spread remains a
significant timing and amplitude issue with a main shortwave over
the east-central to eastern states Fri/Sat that produces major
placement differences with a potentially impactful coastal low
genesis in the western Atlantic. The 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET trended
deeper and less progressive with the inland shortwave and
subsequent coastal system. The 00 UTC GEFS also trended in that
direction. The 00 UTC GFS was slightly less progressive and
northward shifted. The 00 UTC Canadian seems in line with its 12
UTC run. It does seem noteable that the 00 UTC model trends now
seem more favorable for significant system develpment. However, it
has been an annoying recent trend for 00 UTC guidance to trend
slower vs 12 UTC guidance, possibly due to diurnal initialization
data sensitivity. Hopefully, model solutions will continue to
converge on a more common solution.

Accordingly and in anticipation, the earlier released WPC product
suite was primarily derived from the most amplified ensemble mean
solution, the ECMWF ensemble mean. Manual adjustments were further
applied to increase shortwave amplitude smoothed out by the mean
and to maintain max WPC product continuity.

There is potential for heavy snow, sleet, and freezing rain
particularly from the southern Appalachians and
Carolinas/Mid-Atlantic into Fri, potentially into the Northeast by
Sat. The pattern will also be favorable for lake effect snow given
cold air in place. Into early next week, guidance agrees to hold
an amplified mean upper trough over the cooled east-central U.S.,
ableit with variations with embedded shortwaves set to dig and
reinforced the feature underneath a deep low centered just east of
the Hudson Bay.

Meanwhile out West, models genrally agree to dig shortwave energy
southward across the Intermountain West Friday leading to a
Southwest U.S/northern Mexico closed low by the weekend. Lead flow
response in advance of expected system ejection out across the
U.S. southern tier early next week would support a modest swath of
overrunning precipitation within a cooled airmass from Texas
eastward across the Gulf Coast. The best chance for snow will
Fri/Sat down through the Rockies as the shortwave impulse moves
through. Other than that, conditions should remain mostly dry,
with slightly warmer than normal conditions for the West Coast
states underneath the ridge, and above normal temperatures are
then expected for the High Plains early next week.

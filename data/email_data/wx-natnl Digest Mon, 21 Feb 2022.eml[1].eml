Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1053 AM CST Sun Feb 20 2022

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

The ongoing forecast remains generally on track. Some expansion of
the elevated area was made into the lee of the Sangre de Cristo in
southeast Colorado. Dry and windy gap flows should support some fire
concern. 15-20 mph winds across central Oklahoma will foster pockets
of elevated fire weather this afternoon. Uncertainty regarding how
widespread RH less than 25% precludes highlights.

..Wendt.. 02/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Sun Feb 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow aloft should increase today as the Pacific trough
across the western CONUS becomes more amplified. Warm southerly flow
aided by lee troughing will overspread the southern High Plains
along with low relative humidity. Dry conditions, gusty downslope
winds and ongoing drought will favor critical fire weather potential
across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains...
Lee troughing and surface cyclogenesis are forecast to intensify
today ahead of a broad western US trough. Tightening surface
pressure gradients and greater flow aloft will drive
west-southwesterly downslope flow across much of western TX and
eastern NM. Surface winds of 20-30 mph are expected through the
afternoon along with dry and warm surface conditions. A low-level
thermal ridge will support surface RH values of 10-20% from eastern
NM, through the TX Panhandle, and into portions of western OK. Fuels
remain very dry across much of the southern High Plains due to
ongoing drought. This will favor widespread elevated and critical
fire weather conditions.

...Central High Plains...
Westerly downslope flow is forecast to increase trough the afternoon
in response to stronger flow aloft and the developing lee cyclone
across southern CO. The dry downslope winds may support a brief fire
weather risk with surface RH of 20-30% possible for a few hours near
peak heating. The lack of greater temporal coverage suggests the
threat will remain limited, though local fuels remain very dry.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic along with a
heavy snow/ice threat from the southern Plains to the Northeast
Wednesday-Friday...


...Pattern Overview...

Expect an active mid-winter pattern this week as cold Canadian
high pressure digs across much of the lower 48 states. Upper level
troughs will dig through the West, with ejecting energies and
induced frontal waves progressing downstream then overtop a
warming Southeast/East upper ridge. The main upper trough should
shift eastward into the Central Plains and Midwest by later week
as amplified ridging builds from the East Pacific into the West
Coast. This amplified pattern favors a heavy to excessive rainfall
threat from the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the
Mid-Atlantic along with a heavy snow and ice threat from the
southern Plains to the Northeast Wednesday into Friday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest suite of models and ensembles continue to offer a
similar large scale flow evolution through at least day 5. As
such, a composite blend of the 06z GFS and 00z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
were used. After day 5/next weekend, there remains questions on
how quickly the pattern will deamplify and the upper trough energy
weakens and shifts east. The 00z ECMWF is notably stronger with
this energy and slower, with the 06z/12z GFS trending much faster.
The 00z/12z CMC actually provides a decent middle ground solution,
along with the ensemble means. These differences contribute to
frontal placement uncertainties across the South on day 7 and some
rather significant QPF differences too. For days 6-7, prefer a
solution more amplified than the GFS, but maybe not quite as
robust as the ECMWF. The WPC blend used smaller portions of the
CMC/ECMWF blended with the enesmble means, which also kept good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moderate to heavy mountain snows are likely midweek for the
south-central Great Basin/Rockies with the approach/passage of
potent upper trough energy and as enhanced by upslope fetch. Ample
upper energies working downstream from the West will also act to
induce waves along a lead front and tap deepening moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico. This is expected to fuel a heavy to excessive
rainfall and convection threat from the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys to the Mid-Atlantic, mainly
Wednesday/Thursday. Some parts of especially the Tennessee Valley
may receive additional heavy rainfall during this time, after an
initial round in the short range period, which could lead to an
increased threat for flooding and/or flash flooding. Wave
organization and redevelopment should also support the spread of a
potentially significant heavy snow/ice threat from parts of the
southern plains and Mid-Mississippi/Ohio Valleys to a cold air
dammed northern Mid-Atlantic and Northeast Wednesday-Friday.

Strong ridging building over the Western U.S. mid to late period
should result in a very dry period across much of the West, though
some rain/mountain snow may try to move back into the Pacific
northwest next weekend associated with northeast Pacific shortwave
energy. Across the South, significant uncertainty concerning
amplitude/speed of the Western trough results in large differences
in potential QPF across the mid-south, especially the lower
Mississippi Valley to Tennessee Valley. Generally light to
moderate return flow moisture into the region is expected,
although there are some model solutions suggesting a heavier event
could materialize resulting in another round of heavy rainfall for
an already water logged region.

The cold high pressure surge will spread much below temperatures
across much of the western and central U.S. by mid-late week to
include widespread record cold values, especially frigid from the
northern High Plains to the Northern/Central Plains where daytime
highs and overnight lows could be 30-40+ degrees below normal.
This very cold air will spread, but gradually modify later week
across the Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above normal pre-frontal
temperatures are expected across the Southeast/East with some
record warmth likely, especially overnight mins with upper level
ridging and enhanced pre-frontal moisture into the region.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0109 PM CST Sun Feb 20 2022

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Only minor adjustments were made to the elevated area given that
there is slightly higher potential for fire weather concerns farther
to the east. The critical area remains unchanged. The highest degree
of uncertainty continues to be with the southern extent of the fire
weather risk. Moisture return and possible high-based showers still
may limit the duration/magnitude of the concerns.

Given the favorable afternoon timing of the shortwave
trough/mid-level jet, there will be a window of time where extremely
critical conditions may occur. The most likely areas for these
conditions would be from east-central New Mexico into the southern
Texas Panhandle and adjacent South Plains. The speed of the
shortwave trough and lack of a deeper surface cyclone suggest that
these conditions will remain short-lived.

..Wendt.. 02/20/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Sun Feb 20 2022/

...Synopsis...
As the western US trough continues to deepen Monday, strong
southwesterly flow will overspread the Rockies and adjacent Plains.
A deepening lee cyclone/surface trough will favor dry downslope
winds ahead of an arctic front moving quickly south. With dry fuels
in place, widespread critical fire weather conditions are expected
ahead of the front.

...Southern Plains into southern New Mexico...
The strong flow aloft across the Rockies and deepening lee cyclone
will keep downslope flow likely through much of the day Monday.
Model soundings show dry and well-mixed profiles likely supporting
gusts of 35+ mph across much of the southern High Plains. Several
days of warm and dry surface conditions, along with the downslope
flow, will support widespread relative humidity of 8-15% through the
afternoon. Given the very dry fuels and ongoing drought, critical
fire weather conditions are likely.

Across the Hill Country of south-central TX, greater uncertainty
exists regarding the overall fire weather threat with low model
confidence on the position of the surface dryline. Low-level
moisture advection will intensify through much of the day, gradually
moistening the airmass ahead of the lee low. The uncertainty in
surface RH casts some doubt on eastward extent of elevated fire
weather conditions through central TX.

Isentropic ascent from the warm advection ahead of the approaching
trough may also support a few high-based showers across the Trans
Pecos region later in the forecast period. While these factors may
mitigate the fire risk somewhat, very dry fuels and the potential
for strong wind gusts suggest at least elevated fire weather
conditions are possible.

...Snow over the northern Rockies is forecast to expand into the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and down into the central
Rockies for the next couple of days...

...Heavy snow along the Cascades into Monday night...

...Risk of heavy rain, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms
increasing from the southern Plains to Tennessee Valleys during
the next couple of days...

An upper-level trough dipping across the western U.S. will
interact with an outbreak of arctic air from Canada to spawn an
energetic low pressure system which will bring a variety of
impactful weather across the mid-section of the country during the
next few days.  The leading edge of the  arctic air currently
dipping further south into the northern Rockies is expanding the
coverage of snow across the northern High Plains along with
sharply falling temperatures and gusty winds from the north.  The
snow is forecast to spread eastward across the northern Plains
tonight and into Monday before reaching the Great Lakes on
Tuesday.  Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forecast to develop
along the arctic front in the central High Plains on Monday as the
arctic air mass continues its southward plunge through the
northern Plains.  This will gradually shift the snow southward
from the northern Rockies to reach the central Rockies later on
Monday and into Tuesday.  In the mean time, the low pressure
system over the central Plains is forecast to track northeastward
along the arctic front and reach the Midwest later on Tuesday.  A
swath of sleet and freezing rain is expected to develop and expand
eastward across the upper Midwest and into the central Great Lakes
on Tuesday.  Farther north, periods of snow are forecast to
continue across the central Minnesota through the upper Great
Lakes on Tuesday, where more than a foot of snow can be expected
by Tuesday evening.  In addition, winds are expected to remain
strong and gusty across the entire northern tier of the U.S. and
down into the central Plains through Tuesday as the low pressure
system intensifies further.

To the south of the low pressure system, moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico will stream northward and support an emerging threat of
heavy rain, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms to gradually
expand from the southern Plains to Tennessee Valleys during the
next couple of days.  In the meantime, weak onshore flow and
upper-level energy will produce coastal rain and higher elevation
snow over the Pacific Northwest.  The snow will be a multiple-day
heavy snow event for the Cascades.

...Snow over the northern Rockies is forecast to expand into the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes and down into the central
Rockies for the next couple of days...

...Heavy snow along the Cascades into Monday night...

...Risk of heavy rain, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms
increasing from the southern Plains to Tennessee Valleys during
the next couple of days...

An upper-level trough dipping across the western U.S. will
interact with an outbreak of arctic air from Canada to spawn an
energetic low pressure system which will bring a variety of
impactful weather across the mid-section of the country during the
next few days.  The leading edge of the arctic air currently
dipping further south into the northern Rockies is expanding the
coverage of snow across the northern High Plains along with
sharply falling temperatures and gusty winds from the north.  The
snow is forecast to spread eastward across the northern Plains
tonight and into Monday before reaching the Great Lakes on
Tuesday.  Meanwhile, a low pressure system is forecast to develop
along the arctic front in the central High Plains on Monday as the
arctic air mass continues its southward plunge through the
northern Plains.  This will gradually shift the snow southward
from the northern Rockies to reach the central Rockies later on
Monday and into Tuesday.  In the mean time, the low pressure
system over the central Plains is forecast to track northeastward
along the arctic front and reach the Midwest later on Tuesday.  A
swath of sleet and freezing rain is expected to develop and expand
eastward across the upper Midwest and into the central Great Lakes
on Tuesday.  Farther north, periods of snow are forecast to
continue across the central Minnesota through the upper Great
Lakes on Tuesday, where more than a foot of snow can be expected
by Tuesday evening.  In addition, winds are expected to remain
strong and gusty across the entire northern tier of the U.S. and
down into the central Plains through Tuesday as the low pressure
system intensifies further.

To the south of the low pressure system, moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico will stream northward and support an emerging threat of
heavy rain, flash flooding and severe thunderstorms to gradually
expand from the southern Plains to Tennessee Valleys during the
next couple of days.  In the meantime, weak onshore flow and
upper-level energy will produce coastal rain and higher elevation
snow over the Pacific Northwest.  The snow will be heavy along the
Cascades through Monday night before tapering off.  Meanwhile, the
arctic air settling across the northern Plains will slowly filter
westward across the northern Rockies and into the Pacific
Northwest with temperatures falling well below normal by Tuesday
behind the arctic front.  A trend toward colder conditions is also
expected for the Southwest as a cold upper trough dips through the
area during the next couple of days.  Higher elevation snow and
lower elevation rain are forecast to work their way southward
later on Monday and into Tuesday as a low pressure system develops
across the Desert Southwest.

Elsewhere, fire risk is forecast to reach critical levels over the
southern High Plains through Monday night as the developing low
pressure system over the central Plains brings gusty winds and dry
air across the area.

...Heavy to excessive rainfall threat from the Mid-South to the
Mid-Atlantic Thursday along with a significant heavy snow/ice
threat from the Mid-Mississippi Valley northeastward to the
Northeast Thursday-Friday...


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles offer a similar mid-larger scale flow
evolution in a pattern with above normal overall predictability.
An 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian composite along with
the 01 UTC National Blend of Models seems to provide a good
forecast basis days 3-5 (Thursday-Saturday). Blending of these
well clustered models tends to mitigate smaller scale system
variances consistent with predictability. Newer 00 UTC guidance is
consistent. The WPC product suite into days 6/7 was mainly derived
from the ECMWF ensemble mean that maintains a slightly more
amplified Southeast upper ridge that often lingers on the stronger
side of the full envelope of solutions in this type of pattern.
This plan maintains great WPC product continuity.

...Pattern Overview and Weather Highlights/Threats...

A cold pattern ensues this week as Canadian high pressure settles
across much of the lower 48. Upper level troughs will dig through
the West/Southwest, with ejecting energies and induced frontal
waves progressing downstream overtop a warming Southeast upper
ridge. A main upper trough will eject out through the
south-central Plains and Mid-South/OH Valley later this week as
amplified ridging builds from the east Pacific to the West Coast.
This will favor a heavy to excessive rainfall threat from the
Mid-South to the Mid-Atlantic Thursday, along with a significant
heavy snow/ice threat from the cooled Mid-Mississippi Valley
northeastward through Ohio Valley states to the Northeast Thursday
into Friday. Later, northeast Pacific upper trough energies and
precipitation will slowly work toward the Pacific Northwest days
6/7 (Sun/next Mon). This occurs as lead upper troughing ejects out
from the West/Southwest to across the southern U.S. tier to
modestly renew waves and precipitation, albeit with more uncertain
phasing with an amplifying/cold reinforcing northern stream upper
trough then set to dig into the east-central U.S..

The cold high pressure surge will spread much below temperatures
across much of the western and central U.S. by mid-late week to
include widespread record cold values, especially frigid from the
northern High Plains to the Northern/Central Plains where daytime
highs and overnight lows could be 30-40+ degrees below normal.
This very cold air will spread, but gradually modify later week
across the Midwest/East. Meanwhile, much above normal pre-frontal
temperatures are expected across the Southeast/East with some
record warmth likely, especially overnight mins with upper level
ridging and enhanced pre-frontal moisture into the region.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
INTO SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
Active mid-level southwesterly flow is forecast today across much of
the Southwest and southern Rockies/Plains. Within the southwest
flow, several shortwave troughs will move east and intensify ahead
of a broad but deepening trough across the West. As the strong flow
overspread the Rockies and southern Plains, a deepening lee
cyclone/surface trough will force dry downslope winds ahead of an
arctic front moving quickly south. With plentiful fuels in place,
the dry westerly flow will support widespread critical fire weather
conditions across portions of the southern High Plains.

...Southern Plains into southern New Mexico...
Ahead of the intensifying lee cyclone and cold front, strong
west-southwesterly winds are expected to develop by mid morning
across eastern NM and west TX. Continued amplification of the
surface flow is expected through the afternoon, as the top of the
well-mixed boundary layer intersects with an 80 kt speed max aloft.
With model soundings showing PBL depth of several kilometers,
widespread sustained winds of 25-40 mph appear likely with some
higher gusts possible. Owing to the well-mixed nature of the lower
atmosphere and downslope flow off the southern Rockies, low to very
low surface RH values are expected through peak heating. Hi-res
ensemble guidance shows strong confidence in widespread RH below
15%, with minimums in the high single digits possible across the
TX/OK Panhandles and eastern NM. The combination of strong winds and
low humidity will support widespread critical fire weather
conditions. Some potential for locally extremely critical conditions
may also develop where higher gusts and single digit RH can be
realized.

Farther south across southwest and south-central TX, greater
uncertainty in the spatial coverage of elevated/critical fire
weather conditions exists. While surface wind fields are projected
to remain quite strong, low-level moisture advection may result in
surface RH values above elevated/critical thresholds. Some potential
for high-based showers or even a few thunderstorms may also limit
the diurnal RH, especially later in the afternoon. Despite the
uncertainty on marginal RH criteria, the presence of very dry fuels
and the strong winds suggests some potential for fire weather
conditions. Portions of the critical area have been trimmed to the
northwest, but elevated highlights will be kept to account for the
threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0141 AM CST Mon Feb 21 2022

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong Pacific trough across the western CONUS will undergo
substantial deepening Tuesday, as a powerful mid-level jet
approaches the West Coast. As the trough deepens, mid-level flow
will increase above the Southwest and southern Rockies. A surface
cold front associated with a lee low moving across the southern
Plains will progress southward, bringing cooler temperatures and
precipitation farther east. Low-end elevated fire weather conditions
are possible across eastern NM and west TX ahead of the front
through the day Tuesday.

...Southeastern New Mexico and far west Texas...
Strong flow aloft and dry surface conditions will remain in place
Tuesday as the upper trough over the western US continues to deepen.
At the surface, the associated back-door cold front will progress
southwestward with a much cooler and more moist airmass behind it
across the southern Plains. Surface pressure gradients, although
weakening, should remain sufficient for westerly winds of 15-20 mph
given the dry and well-mixed boundary layer and strong flow aloft.
While some uncertainty exists on the placement of the front through
the day, at least some fire weather potential will exist ahead of it
across southeastern NM and west TX. An elevated area has been added
to account for the risk of sub-20 percent RH and winds of 15-20 mph
within very dry fuels.

...Significant winter storm impacting areas of the Plains into the
Great Lakes on Monday into Tuesday...

...Risk of Excessive rainfall, Critical fire weather and severe
thunderstorms increasing from the Southern Plains to
Tennessee/Ohio Valleys from Monday into Wednesday...

...Temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees below average over the
Northern Tier States; In contrast, temperatures will be 10 to 25
degrees above average over Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley into
the Ohio Valley...

A strong developing wave of low pressure over the Central Plains
will move northeastward to the Great Lakes by Tuesday evening and
into Quebec, Canada, by Wednesday morning. The storm will produce
a significant winter storm impacting areas of the Plains into the
Great Lakes. A mixture of snow, sleet, and freezing rain may come
in two waves to parts of the region. Snow will become heavy, with
snowfall rates of one inch per hour or higher with the significant
and long-duration winter storm. Increasing wind may lead to
significant blowing and drifting of snow. Near blizzard conditions
are possible over parts of North and South Dakota. Travel is
discouraged. Total snowfall amounts will likely exceed 6 inches
from the Dakotas into the Upper Great Lakes. More than 12 inches
are possible in some areas over the two days. Significant ice
accumulations are possible into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
starting Monday evening into Tuesday. Some areas may receive a
quarter-inch of ice. Very cold air is expected for much of this
week, with temperatures near record low values and dangerously
cold wind chills in the Plains.

Moreover, temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees below average over
the Northern Tier States, with several locations having
record-breaking or tied low temperatures. In contrast,
temperatures will be 10 to 25 degrees above average over
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley into the Ohio Valley from Monday
into Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, as the cold front moves southward over the
Central/Southern Plains and the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley,
moisture will pool along ahead of the boundary aiding in the
development of showers and thunderstorms; some thunderstorms will
be severe. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of Southern Plains and Middle/Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys through Tuesday morning. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

In addition, there is a threat of excessive rainfall associated
with these thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms. The
associated heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash
flooding, with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most
vulnerable through Tuesday morning.

However, the threat of severe thunderstorms will move eastward as
the front pushes through the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys.
Therefore, from Tuesday into Wednesday morning, the SPC has issued
a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Middle/Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Furthermore,
heavy rain will also be associated with these thunderstorms as a
strong stream of moisture comes off the Gulf of Mexico. Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over
parts of the Ohio Valley with a second over parts of the Tennessee
Valley. The associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of
flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers from Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

In the meantime, with the warm temperatures, dry fuels, and gusty
wind over the Southern High Plains, the SPC has issued a Critical
Risk of fire weather over the region on Monday that will reduce to
an Elevated Risk on Tuesday. Elsewhere, coastal rain and higher
elevation snow will end over the Pacific Northwest by late morning
on Tuesday. Upper-level energy and a surface front will move into
California and the Southwest on Tuesday into Wednesday. Rain and
higher elevation snow will start over California late Monday
morning and expand into Southern California by Tuesday afternoon.
Snow will move into the Great Basin and the Southwest into the
Central Rockies overnight Tuesday into Wednesday morning.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1130 AM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 08/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1237 AM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
Southwesterly flow will persist across much of the interior West as
an upper-level trough gradually shifts inland from the West Coast
through the day. Winds aloft will not be particularly strong, but a
belt of modest mid-level winds will support elevated wind magnitudes
at the surface across the eastern Great Basin and into the central
Rockies. Perturbations within the southwesterly flow regime will
also support isolated dry thunderstorm chances across parts of
southern Montana and northeast Utah. Unreceptive fuels across much
of the interior West will limit the overall fire weather threat
despite favorable meteorological conditions.

...Great Basin and central Rockies...
Elevated conditions were observed yesterday at several surface
stations across eastern NV, western UT, and southern WY with
sustained winds near 15-20 mph, gusts up to 35 mph, and RH
reductions down to 10% at times. With little appreciable change in
the overall synoptic regime, similar conditions are expected again
today for the same region. Recent fuel reports suggest that some
drying/curing has occurred over the past 24 hours, but has not been
sufficient to boost ERCs above normal seasonal values. While
elevated wind/RH criteria will likely be met this afternoon, the
fire weather threat will be limited to locally drier locations.

...Northeast Utah and Southwest Montana...
Guidance continues to show a reasonably good signal for isolated to
scattered convective showers and thunderstorms across northeast UT
and southwest MT this afternoon as weak perturbations within the
mean flow propagate through the central and northern Rockies. Slight
cooling aloft coupled with limited moisture return will yield
low-end instability with PWAT values between 0.5 to 0.7 inches -
supportive of at least an isolated dry lightning threat. However,
fuels across both regions remain unreceptive based on recent
reports, which mitigates a more robust fire weather concern and the
need for highlights at this time.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT August 25 2021

SYNOPSIS: Early in week-2, mid-level low pressure forecast over the Pacific
Northwest is expected to promote below normal temperatures with the potential
for early season frost over parts of Washington and Oregon. Mid-level high
pressure predicted over the north-central contiguous U.S. elevates chances for
excessive heat focused across the Central Plains at the start of the period.
Tropical cyclone formation favored in the Gulf of Mexico late in week-1 is
expected to bring enhanced, and possibly heavy rainfall to parts of the
Southern Plains and Mississippi Valley early in the period. Over Alaska,
mid-level high pressure is expected to support primarily above (below) normal
temperatures (precipitation) during week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Intermountain region, Thu, Sep 2.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Central Plains and the
Middle
Mississippi Valley, Thu, Sep 2.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the portions of the Southern Plains,
and
the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley, Thu-Fri, Sep 2-3.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY AUGUST 28 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 01:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vQF0TrQDseV45pGtZwOhUKhGilbYf_qLq6GPjpQWE5sHNftNz9mW7P7c-0gRWhmJ33W3V9kg$

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 02 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 08: Late in week-1, dynamical
model forecasts of the 500-hPa anomaly height fields continue to feature
anomalous troughing across the northwestern CONUS which is favored to bring
anomalously cooler temperatures to many portions of the West heading into
September. While both the GEFS and ECMWF favor this mid-level feature to
weaken, the ECMWF ensemble favors a more progressive evolution of the mid-
level
height pattern than the GEFS, featuring the return of positive height
departures overspreading the Pacific Northwest, and shallow troughing over the
north-central CONUS as early as day 10. As a result, there are a number of
disparities in the dynamical model and reforecast tool guidance which
introduces uncertainty in regards to hazard potential for much of the outlook
period.



With mid-level troughing likely in place over the Pacific Northwest at the
start of period, there is agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools
depicting at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile and 40 degrees F over portions of Oregon and Washington on day 8.
Therefore, a slight risk of much below normal temperatures remains issued for
the region on Sep 2 as these colder minimum temperatures may lead to early
season frost and impact vegetation. From day 9 and beyond, these signals in
the
reforecast tools diverge, with the ECMWF indicating colder temperatures and
the
associated frost potential shifting eastward into the Northern Plains, whereas
the GEFS maintains this potential further west. Eastward, there is good
agreement among the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favoring positive height
departures over the north-central CONUS on day 8, where both reforecast tools
maintain at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 95 degrees F focused over the Central Plains. Given support
from
the excessive heat tool highlighting the same region with elevated chances for
heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile, a slight risk of excessive
heat remains issued for the region on Sep 2.



Across the tropics, models continue to advertise a Kelvin wave traversing the
Western Hemisphere which is expected to provide a favorable large-scale
environment for tropical cyclogenesis across the East Pacific and the Atlantic
during the first week of September. As of 2:00pm EDT, the National Hurricane
Center (NHC) is currently monitoring a tropical wave in the Caribbean with a
high potential for tropical cyclone (TC) formation during the next 5 days,
where there continues to be consensus among the models tracking this system
into the western Gulf of Mexico. Although much of the heaviest precipitation
tied to this system is likely to occur late in week-1, there are signals in
the
latest guidance indicating heavy precipitation persisting into week-2. The
GEFS
reforecast tool shows an area over southern Texas with at least a 20% chance
of
3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch early
in the period. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool features this heavy
precipitation potential further north across the Mississippi Valley due to the
predicted earlier arrival of this tropical system over land as it undergoes
extratropical transition early in the period. To address these differences
between the tools, an area of slight risk of heavy precipitation remains
posted
but covers a greater spatial extent over the Southern Plains and the Middle
and
Lower Mississippi Valley compared to yesterday, for Sep 2 to 3.



Further north across the Great Plains and Midwest, reforecast tools continue
to
show increased signals for precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile.
However, these totals no longer exceed hazard criteria, thus the slight risk
for heavy precipitation is removed relative to yesterday's outlook.  Later in
week-2, the past few runs of the deterministic GFS and GEFS ensemble favor
additional TC formation in the western Caribbean with several low centers
tracking north into the Gulf of Mexico. However, given the uncertainty at this
lead, and less support of this realization from the ECMWF, no corresponding
hazards are issued at this time, but this potential tropical risk will
continue
to be monitored in subsequent outlooks.



In the eastern Pacific, as of 11:00am PDT, the NHC continues to monitor an
area
of low pressure to the south of Mexico with a 100% chance of TC formation.
Both
the GEFS and ECMWF remain in agreement depicting a tropical low center
approaching the mouth of the Gulf of California, where combined with a thermal
low forecast over the Sonoran Desert, is favorable for the initiation of a
Gulf
Surge event to advect moisture into the Desert Southwest late in week-1. This
is reflected in the Weather Prediction Center's day 6 and day 7 precipitation
forecasts, depicting increased amounts of precipitation over many parts of the
southwestern CONUS. However, models have grown less supportive of additional
TC
activity near the Gulf of California in the East Pacific, thereby reducing the
potential for another Gulf Surge event during week-2. Considering an
unfavorable mean ridge axis position south of the Four Corners region, which
would help suppress monsoonal moisture advection and precipitation, as well
as,
decreased chances for enhanced precipitation over the Desert Southwest
depicted
in the latest reforecast tools, the flooding possible area is removed in
today's outlook.



Mid-level ridging predicted over Alaska predominately favors above-normal
temperatures and below-normal precipitation across much of the southern
Mainland and Alaska Panhandle, thus no hazards are posted for the state during
week-2.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 08/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Wed Aug 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
The potential for dry thunderstorms across the central Rockies and
adjacent High Plains will be the primary fire weather concern for
Thursday. Stronger synoptic lift is forecast to overspread the
inter-mountain West through the day as the upper-level trough
currently over the West Coast translates to the east. A few
localized areas of elevated wind/RH conditions may emerge, but will
most likely reside over areas with poor fuel readiness.

...Central Rockies to the Hi...
Isolated to scattered thunderstorms appear probable from eastern UT
into CO and WY by the mid to late afternoon hours Thursday. Deep,
dry boundary layers, PWAT values between 0.5 and 0.7 inches, and
fast storm motions (near 40 knots in some solutions) may limit
rainfall amounts. Latest ensemble guidance suggests multiple rounds
of showers/thunderstorms over eastern UT and CO should result in
areas of wetting rain, but more isolated convection over
central/eastern WY may limit this potential. Fuels across much of
the central Rockies are unreceptive with ERC values near or below
the 50th percentile. Adjacent portions of the high Plains are drier
with ERC values closer to the 75th percentile. Although isolated dry
thunderstorms are possible across the broader region, eastern WY is
highlighted given the favorable overlap of dry fuels and dry thunder
potential.

...Eastern and northern Great Basin...
Breezy northwesterly winds may increase to 15-20 mph behind a weak
cold front Thursday afternoon for parts of eastern NV and through
the Snake River Plain of eastern ID. Strong diurnal heating will
likely result in RH reductions into the teens. While elevated
wind/RH conditions are possible, poor fuel readiness and limited
spatial coverage of these conditions suggests a limited fire weather
concern.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend through
Saturday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the central/western Gulf Coast
early next week with possible tropical development...

...Overview...

A strong shortwave trough pushing through the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest and its associated surface front will continue the
heavy rainfall threat across portions of the Upper Midwest through
Saturday. An upstream trough with embedded upper low should reach
western Canada and the Northwest U.S. by next Monday-Wednesday,
with a leading frontal system pushing into the Northwest and
eventually the northern Plains.  Ahead of these systems, a front
settling over the Mid-Atlantic by the weekend may focus some rain
and thunderstorms. Attention also turns to the southern U.S. where
upper ridging prevails over the weekend then subsides some as a
tropical wave emerges into the western Gulf. A possible tropical
system could bring a host of weather hazards to the
western/central Gulf Coast early next week but confidence in
specifics in lower than average at this time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic and ensemble guidance showed average to
above average agreement with respect to the large scale pattern,
particularly with the northern stream energies, over the course of
the medium range period. Initial shortwave troughing will progress
through the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest this weekend then
head toward the Hudson Bay region. Its associated surface front,
initially stalled over the Midwest giving way to a heavy rainfall
threat, will gradually move across the Great Lakes and Northeast.
Upstream shortwave troughing will then drop in across the
Northwest and Northern Plains where some of the typical model
biases were noted. But a consensus approach was favored and this
trended well from continuity.

There is considerable and full range of model spread with the
potential tropical system that may develop over the Caribbean. The
latest guidance continues on a rightward/northeast shift,
particularly as the system crosses or approaches the Yucatan
Peninsula into the central/western Gulf. The CMC was a faster
solution while the UKMET was on the slower side of the spread in
regards to timing. The GFS and ECMWF were fairly close and near
the consensus, so a blend of the two (with some favoring toward
continuity) was favored for this cycle. Consult the National
Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the latest
information on this development potential over the coming days.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest forecast guidance continues to show an increasing
signal for tropical development and potential impacts along the
western/central Gulf Coast early next week. The
rightward/northeast shift noted over the last few cycles continues
again today though there remains some larger spread beyond day 5
in all the guidance, so while confidence is increasing in a system
and potential impacts, there remains uncertainty in exactly where.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, the heavy rain potential over parts of
the Upper Midwest should extend through Saturday ahead of a wavy
frontal system whose eastward progression should finally lead to a
drier trend later in the weekend and early next week.  Expect
areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity to accompany
this front as it continues into the East.  A leading front draped
over the eastern Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic may promote periods
of rain/storms during the weekend.  Farther south away from these
fronts some diurnally-favored convection will be possible within
the hot and humid air mass.  One or more waves/fronts ahead of the
upper trough moving into western North America may bring some
rainfall into the northern tier by next Tuesday or Wednesday.
Scattered diurnal convection is possible over the southern
Rockies/Arizona through the period.

Areas from the Midwest into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
southern Mid-Atlantic will be quite warm to hot ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains followed by a cooling trend after
frontal passage.  From the weekend into early next week there
should be decent coverage of morning lows 10-15F above normal
while a few locations could reach plus 10F or so anomalies for
highs.  Some daily record warm lows are possible.  The northern
Rockies/High Plains will see highs up to 10-15F below normal
Saturday followed by moderation of the cool air as it continues
eastward.  After a rebound to around normal, parts of Montana may
see below normal highs once again by next Wednesday.  Portions of
California/Oregon/Nevada should see highs 5-10F above normal
during the weekend followed by a cooling trend and then the
central High Plains should trend warmer to similar anomalies early
next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed August 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 31 - SEP 04, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over the
western Aleutian Islands and a ridge over the Gulf of Alaska and southern
Mainland Alaska, with positive 500-hPa height anomalies across much of the
state. A ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over the
north-central CONUS in ensemble mean forecasts. Troughs are predicted over the
northwestern CONUS and over Quebec and New England, with associated below
normal mid-level heights. Anomalous southerly flow and surface low pressure
are
predicted over western areas of the Southwest, potentially influenced by
tropical activity in the East Pacific.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska, under predicted
positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Above normal temperatures are favored
across
much of the CONUS, due to predicted 500-hPa ridging over the central CONUS.
Probabilities for above normal temperatures exceed 60 percent over the Central
Plains, supported by the temperature consolidation tool. Troughing and near to
below normal heights favor enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures
over the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies, and parts of western Montana.
Short term bias corrected temperature forecasts from the GEFS and Canadian
ensembles, and the raw ECMWF ensemble, indicate below normal temperatures are
likely along the western Gulf Coast, while bias-corrected ECMWF and GEFS
ensemble model temperature forecasts based on multi-decadal reforecasts
predict
likely above normal temperatures for the region. Near normal temperatures are
favored in this region, due to this uncertainty and potential for increased
cloud cover.

Below normal precipitation is favored over eastern Mainland Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, under a predicted ridge. Below normal precipitation
probabilities are enhanced over the Pacific Northwest, under anomalous
northwesterly flow, and consistent with the precipitation consolidation
forecast tool. Dynamical model precipitation forecast tools support increased
probabilities of above normal precipitation over the western Gulf Coast and
Lower Mississippi Valley related to a potential tropical system currently
located over the Caribbean, which the National Hurricane Center has given an
80
percent chance of development in the next 5 days. Above normal precipitation
is
also favored for western areas of the Southwest across the Central Rockies
into
the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, supported by the
precipitation consolidation tool. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored
over the Southern High Plains and Southeast, as predicted by the precipitation
consolidation tool. Below normal precipitation is likely for parts of the
Northeast, under anomalous northerly flow behind a predicted trough.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 02 - 08 2021

During the week-2 period, a low amplitude 500-hPa circulation pattern is
predicted overall with increasing uncertainty. In general, the manual blend of
dynamical model forecasts indicates similar large-scale features to the 6-10
day forecast, with  weaker 500-hPa height anomalies. A trough is forecast over
parts of the Northwest CONUS, with near zero or slightly negative 500-hPa
height anomalies shifted to the east relative to the 6-10 day period forecast.
Slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most of the
remainder of the CONUS, except for the south-central CONUS, the Northeast
region, and the southern Florida Peninsula. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies
are forecast over northern New England, under the predicted trough. Positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over Alaska in week-2.

Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances for above normal
temperatures over southern and central Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and the
Alaska Panhandle. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across much of
the CONUS, under slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies and supported by
the temperature consolidation tool. Near to below normal temperatures are
favored for the Pacific Northwest, Northern Rockies and the Northern Plains,
associated with a weak mid-level trough over the region early in the week-2
period. With potential increased cloudiness and near average heights, near
normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Southwest, parts of the
Northeast region, and the western and central Gulf Coast region.

Below normal precipitation is favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska, and
the
Alaska Panhandle, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
precipitation is likely for much of the Pacific Northwest, as well as the
southern Florida Peninsula, consistent with the precipitation consolidation
tool. Although uncertainty increases in week-2 among dynamical model
precipitation tools, near to above normal precipitation is favored across much
of the CONUS. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are elevated from
the Four Corners region northeastward into parts of the Northern and Central
Plains supported primarily by the reforecast calibrated GEFS precipitation
tool, which has been more skillful than recent ECMWF precipitation forecasts.
Above normal precipitation probabilities are also increased for most of the
Mississippi Valley and the western and central Gulf Coast, extending to the
Ohio Valley, supported by the GEFS precipitation tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered
on
Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 10%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
fair agreement among the models on a low amplitude large-scale circulation
pattern, offset by increasing differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

...Upper Midwest heavy rain threat likely to extend through
Saturday...

...Heavy rain threat for parts of the central/western Gulf Coast
early next week with possible tropical development...

...Overview...

A strong shortwave trough pushing through the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest and its associated surface front will continue the
heavy rainfall threat across portions of the Upper Midwest through
Saturday. An upstream trough with embedded upper low should reach
western Canada and the Northwest U.S. by next Monday-Wednesday,
with a leading frontal system pushing into the Northwest and
eventually the northern Plains.  Ahead of these systems, a front
settling over the Mid-Atlantic by the weekend may focus some rain
and thunderstorms. Attention also turns to the southern U.S. where
upper ridging prevails over the weekend then subsides some as a
tropical wave emerges into the western Gulf. A possible tropical
system could bring a host of weather hazards to the
western/central Gulf Coast early next week but confidence in
specifics in lower than average at this time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The latest deterministic and ensemble guidance showed average to
above average agreement with respect to the large scale pattern,
particularly with the northern stream energies, over the course of
the medium range period. Initial shortwave troughing will progress
through the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest this weekend then
head toward the Hudson Bay region. Its associated surface front,
initially stalled over the Midwest giving way to a heavy rainfall
threat, will gradually move across the Great Lakes and Northeast.
Upstream shortwave troughing will then drop in across the
Northwest and Northern Plains where some of the typical model
biases were noted. But a consensus approach was favored and this
trended well from continuity.

There is considerable and full range of model spread with the
potential tropical system that may develop over the Caribbean. The
latest guidance continues on a rightward/northeast shift,
particularly as the system crosses or approaches the Yucatan
Peninsula into the central/western Gulf. The CMC was a faster
solution while the UKMET was on the slower side of the spread in
regards to timing. The GFS and ECMWF were fairly close and near
the consensus, so a blend of the two (with some favoring toward
continuity) was favored for this cycle. Consult the National
Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlooks for the latest
information on this development potential over the coming days.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest forecast guidance continues to show an increasing
signal for tropical development and potential impacts along the
western/central Gulf Coast early next week. The
rightward/northeast shift noted over the last few cycles continues
again today though there remains some larger spread beyond day 5
in all the guidance, so while confidence is increasing in a system
and potential impacts, there remains uncertainty in exactly where.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, the heavy rain potential over parts of
the Upper Midwest should extend through Saturday ahead of a wavy
frontal system whose eastward progression should finally lead to a
drier trend later in the weekend and early next week.  Expect
areas of rain and thunderstorms of varying intensity to accompany
this front as it continues into the East.  A leading front draped
over the eastern Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic may promote periods
of rain/storms during the weekend.  Farther south away from these
fronts some diurnally-favored convection will be possible within
the hot and humid air mass.  One or more waves/fronts ahead of the
upper trough moving into western North America may bring some
rainfall into the northern tier by next Tuesday or Wednesday.
Scattered diurnal convection is possible over the southern
Rockies/Arizona through the period.

Areas from the Midwest into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and
southern Mid-Atlantic will be quite warm to hot ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains followed by a cooling trend after
frontal passage.  From the weekend into early next week there
should be decent coverage of morning lows 10-15F above normal
while a few locations could reach plus 10F or so anomalies for
highs.  Some daily record warm lows are possible.  The northern
Rockies/High Plains will see highs up to 10-15F below normal
Saturday followed by moderation of the cool air as it continues
eastward.  After a rebound to around normal, parts of Montana may
see below normal highs once again by next Wednesday.  Portions of
California/Oregon/Nevada should see highs 5-10F above normal
during the weekend followed by a cooling trend and then the
central High Plains should trend warmer to similar anomalies early
next week.

...Isolated severe thunderstorms and the potential for flash
flooding are forecast across the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest...

...Persistent heat and humidity continues throughout much of the
central and eastern United States, while dangerously hot
temperatures return to the Southwest...

Rain has been a hard find this summer throughout much of the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, but that is expected to change
over the next few days as multiple rounds of showers and
thunderstorms develop and traverse the north-central United
States. The features responsible for the active weather include a
slow-moving cold front continuing across the Upper Great Lakes
tonight, with the western section of this frontal boundary lifting
as a warm front over the Central Plains on Thursday. Meanwhile, an
upper-level trough over the Northwest, favorable jet stream
dynamics, and a plentiful amount of atmospheric moisture could
lead to thunderstorms turning severe and producing several inches
of rain. A few thunderstorms forming along the frontal boundary
today could contain large hail and damaging wind gusts in the
Central/Northern Plains through tonight, with some threat for high
winds across parts of the Midwest/Ohio Valley and even across the
Central Appalachians (where scattered storms could occur this
evening) as well. By Thursday, more widespread thunderstorm
activity is expected to be found between the Northern High Plains
into the Middle Mississippi Valley, where the Storm Prediction
Center has issued Slight Risks (level 2/5) of severe
thunderstorms. Even though much of this region is experiencing
severe to exceptional drought, multiple inches of rain could fall
and lead to flash flooding concerns for both rural and urban areas
of the Upper Midwest to Upper Great Lakes on Thursday and Friday.
Slight Risks (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall have been issued
for eastern North Dakota to central Wisconsin on Thursday and for
southeastern Minnesota into much of Wisconsin on Friday in order
to highlight the potential hazard.

South of the aforementioned frontal boundary, much of the central
and eastern U.S. will deal with a few more days of sizzling heat
and humidity. An expansive upper-level ridge extending from the
Southwest all the way to the East Coast will fuel above average
high temperatures and high heat indices, along with air quality
issues in mainly urban areas. Widespread high temperatures into
the 90s will be found throughout a large section of the country,
with triple digits possible over the Central/Southern Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley through Thursday. While only a handful
of daily record high temperatures are forecast to fall, dozens of
daily record warm minimum temperatures could be broken through the
end of this week across the eastern third of the country. These
warm overnight temperatures can make it extremely dangerous for
those without proper air conditioning. Heat Advisories have been
issued across a widespread area extending from eastern sections of
the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast. Meanwhile,
dangerous heat is also making a return to the Southwest today and
is expected to last through at least Friday. High temperatures
here could reach close to 115F, increasing the threat of
heat-related illnesses. Excessive Heat Warnings are now in effect
between the Low Desert of California and southern Arizona.

Elsewhere, scattered thunderstorms are possible across the
Southeast and Gulf Coast over the next few days, a few of which
could lead to isolated instances of flash flooding especially this
evening. Farther west, Air Quality Alerts due to wildfire smoke
remain in effect across parts of the Great Basin and
Northern/Central Rockies. Red Flag Warnings also remain in effect
across much of Wyoming and far northwest Colorado as gusty winds
and low relative humidity could contribute to extreme fire
behavior.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1240 AM CDT Thu Aug 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough over the West will continue translating
east/northeast today, bringing the potential for wetting showers and
thunderstorms to much of the Rockies. Fire weather concerns will
primarily be driven by dry thunderstorm chances across
east/northeast Wyoming and locally elevated wind/RH conditions
across parts of the eastern Great Basin.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Recent ensemble guidance continues to show a QPF minimum across
eastern WY this afternoon - likely the result of isolated
shower/thunderstorm coverage and a deep, dry boundary layer.
Forecast soundings continue to show favorable thermodynamic profiles
for dry lightning potential with 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE, PWAT values
near 0.5-0.6 inches, and fast storm motions. Any storms that
propagate into east/northeastern WY will have the potential for
several dry lightning strikes. Recent fuel guidance shows fuels
remain dry with ERC values near the 75th percentile, warranting the
maintenance of the dry thunderstorm highlight.

...Eastern Great Basin...
Daytime heating will likely drive at least modest boundary-layer
mixing by early afternoon that will support breezy conditions (winds
between 15-20 mph) prior to shower/thunderstorm development by mid
to late afternoon. Relative humidity may fall as low as 10-15% for
some locations, resulting in pockets of elevated wind/RH conditions.
Locations from far eastern NV/western UT into southwest WY will see
the highest potential for meeting such wind/RH criteria, but
generally unreceptive fuels and limited spatial coverage and
duration preclude the need for highlights. One consideration is the
potential impact these conditions may have on any holdover fires
after dry lightning activity across UT/southwest WY over the past 24
hours (though the aforementioned fuel status suggests holdover
potential is low).

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0126 AM CDT Thu Aug 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A weak cold front is forecast to continue pushing southeastward into
the inter-mountain West on Friday. This will cool temperatures and
aid in humidity recovery for parts of the Northwest and northern
Great Basin. An upper-level impulse will help foster strengthening
winds across the central Rockies. Fire weather concerns will most
likely remain localized in nature with low potential for a
robust/widespread fire weather threat.

...Central Rockies...
Winds are forecast to increase across the central Rockies Friday
afternoon in response to the approach of an upper-level shortwave
trough, lee pressure falls, and a tightening low/mid-level pressure
gradient. Hi-res solutions and ensemble guidance show reasonable
probabilities for 15-20 mph winds across eastern ID, northeast UT,
northern CO, and into much of WY that will likely coincide with
diurnal RH reductions to 15-20%. Meeting elevated wind/RH criteria
is probable, and a few locations may experience periods of critical
conditions. While the synoptic regime is favorable for fire weather
concerns, fuels will likely remain unreceptive due to scattered
showers/thunderstorms over the prior 24 hours. Locations that manage
to remain dry may see fine fuels respond sufficiently to support a
fire weather concern.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
Building surface high pressure across northern CA and the Pacific
Northwest will likely drive northerly winds through the northern
Sacramento Valley. Hi-res model guidance hints that terrain
influences will support winds between 15-25 mph during the afternoon
hours when RH is forecast to fall into the teens. Given the dry
fuels across the region, this may support elevated (to perhaps
locally critical) conditions Friday afternoon. However, confidence
in the spatial extent of this threat is uncertain as it may be
closely tied to local terrain features. Trends will be monitored and
highlights may be needed if a more widespread threat becomes
apparent.

...Heavy rain threat for areas along and north of the central Gulf
Coast late weekend onward with possible tropical development...

...Overview...

By mid-late next week the ongoing pattern of progressive flow
aloft extending from the northeastern Pacific across the northern
tier U.S./southern Canada shows signs of slowing down as mean
troughing becomes more established over western Canada into the
northwestern U.S. as well as over eastern Canada into the
northeastern states, with a ridge building in-between.  A leading
shortwave will push a Midwest/Plains front into the East while the
upper trough pushing into western North America will bring a cold
front into the Northwest.  At lower latitudes, guidance still
exhibits some spread and trends but offers increasing confidence
that a Caribbean wave will ultimately generate a tropical system
that will track northward over the Gulf of Mexico and into the
southern U.S. as it finds a weakness within the mean ridge across
the southern half of the country.  This system would produce
hazards including heavy rainfall and strong winds.  The heavy
rainfall threat may extend northward depending on system track and
possible interaction with the front that stalls after reaching the
eastern U.S.  In addition the National Hurricane Center is issuing
advisories on eastern Pacific Tropical Depression Fourteen-E which
should eventually strengthen to a hurricane for a time and track
close to Baja California.  Some moisture from Fourteen-E could
eventually reach the Southwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

For the possible tropical system tracking over the Gulf of Mexico,
trends are less dramatic than seen over the past couple days but
the 18Z GFS provided yet another adjustment on the faster/eastward
side of the spread versus other guidance.  The new 00Z GFS backed
off a bit on its speed versus the 18Z run while the 00Z CMC is
close to the GFS for most of the period (and east of the 12Z run).
 The 00Z UKMET agrees with the model consensus for a Louisiana
landfall and is close to the 12Z ECMWF/00Z GEFS mean but is slower
than the new GFS/CMC.  The new 00Z ECMWF continues the
faster/eastward theme.  While specifics remain uncertain, these
latest model runs are increasing confidence in tropical
development and a track somewhere toward the central Gulf Coast.
Based on guidance available at the time of forecast preparation,
the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/GFS provided the composite template in principle
along with a compromise with continuity.  A blend of those models
compared rather well to the ensemble means for the significant
northern stream features through the period so even by day 7
Thursday the forecast needed to employ only a modest weight of the
means to smooth the proverbial rough edges.  There has been a
noticeable slower trend with the leading side of the incoming
western trough aloft which has a corresponding effect on surface
features eventually reaching the northern Plains.  Finally,
guidance is not well clustered for Fourteen-E so confidence is
well below average for how much moisture from this system may
eventually reach the southwestern U.S. and where.  The 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean were the closest solutions to the track from the
03Z National Hurricane Center advisory.


...Sensible Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The latest guidance is adding to confidence in the general
forecast of tropical development and potential impacts, most
likely along and near the central Gulf Coast from late weekend
into next week.  However there is still a fair degree of
uncertainty for exact track and timing (with somewhat of an
eastward trend still evident) since guidance has not sufficiently
stabilized yet for those aspects of the system.  Current consensus
would extend the heavy rain threat northward at least into parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Tennessee Valley.  How this
moisture may interact with a front that stalls over the East will
require monitoring as well.  Before the tropical system's arrival
this front will be accompanied by areas of rain and thunderstorms
as it progresses from the Midwest/Plains into the East during the
first half of the week.  The trailing part of the front over the
Plains may provide a focus for one or more episodes of rainfall
over portions of the Midwest/northern tier states.  A wavy
stationary/warm front over the Northeast may focus some rainfall
Sunday-Monday.  With time rainfall should gradually increase in
coverage and intensity over the Southwest and vicinity as the
upper pattern becomes more favorable for drawing some moisture
from western Mexico and the eastern Pacific.  A significant wild
card will be the exact track of Tropical Depression Fourteen-E and
how its moisture may ultimately be incorporated into the flow.

Locations from the Great Lakes into the southern Mid-Atlantic will
be quite warm to hot at the start of the week, ahead of the cold
front emerging from the Plains/Midwest.  Expect somewhat greater
coverage of plus 10-15F anomalies for morning lows relative to
daytime highs, with daily records also more likely for warm lows.
Then eastern U.S. temperatures will moderate over the rest of the
week.  California and the Great Basin will see moderately above
normal highs Sunday-Monday.  Then a majority of the West will see
a cooling trend to below normal highs as an upper trough reaches
the Northwest and clouds/rainfall expand over the Southwest.  The
central High Plains will see highs 5-10F or so above normal
Monday-Wednesday.

...Severe thunderstorms and the potential for flash flooding are
forecast across portions of the Northern Plains and Midwest
through Friday...

...Uncomfortable and potentially dangerous heat continues
throughout much of the central and eastern United States, as well
as the Desert Southwest...

Rain has been scarce this summer throughout much of the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest, but that will change over the next few
days as widespread showers and thunderstorms are forecast develop
and traverse the north-central United States through the end of
the week. The features responsible for the active weather include
a quasi-stationary boundary extending from the Lower Great Lakes
across the Midwest and eventually into the Northern High Plains.
Meanwhile, an upper-level trough over the Northwest, favorable jet
stream dynamics, and a plentiful amount of atmospheric moisture
could lead to thunderstorms turning severe and producing several
inches of rain. For today, an Enhanced Risk (level 3/5) of severe
weather has been issued across northern Iowa and southern
Minnesota, where the threat of isolated tornadoes and damaging
wind gusts are highest. Thunderstorms may also produce gusty winds
and large hail across eastern Montana, as well as an area
extending from northwest Illinois to South Dakota and northern
Nebraska (surrounding the aforementioned Enhanced Risk). By
Friday, additional rounds of severe thunderstorms are possible
across the same regions, with greatest risk found once again
across the Midwest. Even though much of this region is
experiencing extreme drought, multiple inches of rain could fall
and lead to flash flooding concerns for both rural and urban areas
of the Upper Midwest to Upper Great Lakes today and Friday. Slight
Risks (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall have been issued for
eastern North Dakota to central Wisconsin today and for
southeastern Minnesota into much of Wisconsin on Friday in order
to highlight the potential hazard.

South of the aforementioned frontal boundary, much of the central
and eastern U.S. will deal with a few more days of sultry late
August weather. An expansive upper-level ridge extending from the
Southwest to the East Coast will fuel above average high
temperatures and high heat indices, along with air quality issues
in mainly urban areas. Widespread high temperatures into the 90s
will be found throughout a large section of the country, with
triple digits possible over the Central/Southern Plains and Middle
Mississippi Valley today. While only a few daily record high
temperatures are forecast to fall, dozens of daily record warm
minimum temperatures could be broken through the end of this week
across the eastern third of the country. These warm overnight
temperatures in the 70s can make it extremely dangerous for those
without access to proper air conditioning. Heat Advisories have
been issued across numerous areas extending from eastern sections
of the Southern Plains to New England. Meanwhile, dangerous heat
is also forecast throughout the Desert Southwest today and Friday.
High temperatures here could reach close to 115F, increasing the
threat of heat-related illnesses. Excessive Heat Warnings are in
effect between the Low Desert of California and southern Arizona.


Elsewhere, scattered thunderstorms are possible along the Gulf
Coast over the next few days and parts of the Northeast by Friday,
a few of which could lead to isolated instances of flash flooding.
Farther west, Air Quality Alerts due to wildfire smoke remain in
effect across parts of the Great Basin and Northern/Central
Rockies. Looking for cooler temperatures? Highs around 10-20
degrees below average are forecast across North Dakota and
northern Minnesota through the beginning of the weekend and the
Northern Rockies beginning on Friday.

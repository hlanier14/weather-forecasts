...A deepening low pressure system presents a mid-late next week
heavy rain/severe weather threat across the South and heavy
snow/ice threat focus across the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes...

...Overview...

The main weather focus across this fine nation will work from the
Southwest to the south-central Rockies Tuesday. As the system
lifts across the central U.S. mid-later week, guidance favors
ample phasing with northern stream trough energies digging into
the northern Plains that would promote solid intensification of a
surface low and associated frontal systems. Overall, this will
favor rather unsettled and wet pattern from the Southwest to the
south-central Rockies (including mountain snows) that will
emerge/expand in magnitude and spread from the Plains into midweek
in an active severe weather pattern per SPC to a still active
east-central and eastern/southeastern U.S. later next week as Gulf
moisture/instability is increasingly fed into the deep low/dynamic
system and fronts in a pattern with coupled upper jet support.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

A composite of the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian
along with the 01 UTC NBM seems to offer a run to run consistent
forecast days 3/4 (Tuesday-Wednesday) that enjoys good
GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble support. Forecast clustering has
improved through medium range time scales. However, the 12 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean seems best in line best in line with WPC
continuity days 5-7 (Thursday-next Saturday), so have adjusted NBM
guidance strongly toward this guidance. This blend offers good
product detail consistent with a pattern with gradually lowering
but still above normal predictability. A lingering guidance
difference in this time frame concerns upper trough/system
amplification back over the West well upstream of the main lead
central to eastern U.S. storm. Overall, the 12 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian and ECMWF/Canadian ensemble means and their
latest 00 UTC versions develop a more amplified eastern Pacific
upper ridge than the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean. This allows for deeper
trough digging back into the West late next week. The 00 UTC
GFS/GEFS mean has trended in this direction.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A ejecting southern CA/Southwest upper low will support a spread
of enhanced rain and higher elevation snow across the region to
the south-central Intermountain West/Rockies Tuesday. As surface
low pressure strengthens in the Plains and tracks northeast,
increasingly widespread rain and the threat for severe weather
with heavy downpours are forecast to develop over the southern
Plains late Tuesday and then move across the South by Wednesday
before reaching the Southeast on Thursday. The heaviest rains are
forecast to move through the eastern southern Plains through the
Mid-South/Gulf Coast states Tuesday night through Thursday where
areas of flash flooding are possible. An emerging "slight" risk
area is depicted on the new experimental WPC day 5 ERO given
favorable system ingredients and antecedent conditions. Meanwhile,
light rain and some thunderstorms are also expected farther north
from the central Plains through the Mid-Atlantic. On the northern
side of the precipitation shield, the potential for a swath of
heavy wintry mix and accumulating deep low wrapping snows have
increased across the Upper Midwest to the Great Lakes later
Tuesday into Wednesday-Thursday. High winds could also be an
impact during this time frame. Some wintry precipitation is also
forecast for interior New England late Thursday/early Friday ahead
of a warm front, while pockets of heavy rain are possible then
down the East Coast ahead of a cold front. Over the central
Rockies to the nearby High Plains, the trend toward a stronger
surge of cold air down the High Plains has also increased the
potential for heavier snowfall from the central Rockies to the
central High Plains on Tuesday. By late next week, another upper
trough is forecast to dig southeastward from the Pacific Northwest
through the western U.S. and could provide another opportunity for
an enhanced round of wintry mix from the northern to central
Rockies to the nearby High Plains.

...Light snow over parts of the Great Lakes into the Central
Appalachians...

...Well-above average to record-breaking temperatures across the
Western U.S. and Southern Plains...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic and parts of Central-Southern
Texas...

Multiple areas of upper-level energy will flow over the Great
Lakes into the Northeast through Monday morning, creating a deep
upper-level trough over the region. The energy will aid in
producing lake-enhanced snow over the Great Lakes into the Ohio
Valley and upslope snow for the Central Appalachians through
Sunday morning when the snow starts to wane. The highest snowfall
accumulations will be along the southeast coast of Lake Erie and
the east coast of Lake Ontario. Likewise, the highest snowfall
amounts will be in the upslope regions of the Central
Appalachians. Rain and high elevation snow will start over the
northern Mid-Atlantic Coast into parts of the Northeast on
Saturday afternoon and end mainly by Sunday afternoon, with a few
snow showers lingering into Monday.

A deep upper-level trough will be associated with the upper-level
energy, bringing temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below average to
the Upper Midwest into the Ohio Valley through Monday. In
contrast, temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average from
parts of the Great Basin/Southwest to the Southern Plains. In
addition, an upper-level ridge over the Rockies will allow
temperatures to reach record or tied for record high temperature
over the southwestern portion of the country through Sunday.

Furthermore, weak onshore flow will aid in producing light rain
over parts of the Pacific Northwest on Saturday into Sunday. An
approaching deep upper-level low will begin to move onshore over
California Sunday night into Monday. Therefore, overnight Sunday,
light rain will develop over the West Coast, with higher elevation
snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains early Monday morning.

In addition, the SPC has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Southeast/southern Mid-Atlantic and parts of
Central-Southern Texas Saturday into Sunday morning due to gusty
winds, low relative humidity, and dry fuels. The threat of an
Elevated Risk of fire weather continues on Sunday into Monday
morning.

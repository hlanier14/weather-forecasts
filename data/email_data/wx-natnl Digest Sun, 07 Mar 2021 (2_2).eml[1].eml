Valid 12Z Sun Mar 07 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 09 2021

...Rain and snow for the Northwest into parts of Northern/Central
California through Tuesday...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Upper Midwest on Sunday into Monday...

A front along the Northwest Coast will move inland to the Northern
Plains southwestward to the Great Basin by Tuesday.  The system
will produce rain and mountain snow over the Pacific Northwest
through Monday morning, when the rain will end.  The snow will
expand into parts of the Northern Rockies on Sunday.  On Monday,
additional upper-level energy will move onshore over the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California that will move inland to the
Northern High Plains by Tuesday.  Late on Monday morning, the rain
will return to parts of Northern California and the Pacific
Northwest, with snow developing at the higher elevations and snow
into parts of the Great Basin continuing through Tuesday.

Over northeast Kansas, the SPC has issued an elevated risk of fire
weather due to gusty winds and low humidity levels over the region
on Sunday.  Elsewhere, spring-like temperatures have taken hold of
the Northern Plains, with a larger portion of the Midwest and
Plains forecast to reach seasonably warm levels of 15 to 20
degrees above average on Sunday into Monday.

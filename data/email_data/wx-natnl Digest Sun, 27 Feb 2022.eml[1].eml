...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions

..Squitieri.. 02/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1226 AM CST Sat Feb 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough and strong midlevel west-southwesterly flow will
emerge over the central Plains by this afternoon, while a
mid/upper-level ridge builds over the western CONUS.

...Central Plains...
As the shortwave trough crosses the central Rockies, downslope
warming/drying and efficient diurnal heating will result in minimum
afternoon RH of 15-20 percent over parts of NE. Over southern NE,
modest west-southwesterly surface winds near 15 mph may coincide
with the low RH for a few hours, where fuels remain dry owing to a
lack of snow cover. However, these conditions appear too marginal
and localized for Elevated highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will tighten over southern
California, where a few hours of critically low RH and breezy/gusty
northeasterly surface winds are expected. This will especially be
the case over parts of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, where gusts
of 25-45 mph will be possible during the morning and afternoon
hours. With that said, high live fuel moisture should generally
mitigate the fire-weather risk, precluding highlights at this time.

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an upper pattern consisting of a
western ridge and broad eastern mean trough through midweek,
followed by a transition toward a mean trough settling into the
western U.S. while upper heights rise farther to the east.  The
primary precipitation focus early in the period will be over the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies ahead of the eastern
Pacific trough that eventually moves into the West.  Progression
of this trough later in the week into next weekend will spread
precipitation over other parts of the West and then bring a
variety of precipitation types to the central U.S. as low pressure
emerges over the Plains.  Ahead of this system, expect most
precipitation east of the Rockies to be confined to a couple
episodes of snow across northern areas with associated surface
waves.  The pattern evolution will favor above normal temperatures
over a majority of the western/central U.S. through Wednesday or
Thursday and then a cooler trend over the West and warmer readings
over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, the latest 00z/06z suite of models and ensembles
continued to be relatively agreeable on the large scale flow
evolution during the medium range period. There remains some
questions on timing of a few clipper systems within the broader
Eastern U.S. trough. Bigger uncertainties lie with a couple of
incoming shortwaves into the West and then how that trough opens
and broadens over the West late period. The 00z ECMWF is a hair
faster with an initial shortwave into the Pacific Northwest on
Thursday (and also late period with developing low pressure over
the Plains), while the CMC is more amplified. More uncertainty
upstream from this initial wave arise, mainly in the details of
possible compact and embedded closed lows and timing. In general,
the 06z GFS seemed to be the most stable and agreeable to the
ensemble means as the mean trough comes into play across the West.

The WPC blend for todays updated progs used a multi-model
deterministic blend for days 3-4, slowly increasing contribution
from the ensemble means later in the period. Was able to maintain
60 percent deterministic even out to day 7, though with more
weighting on the GFS compared to the ECMWF and CMC. This approach
helps to mitigate the harder to resolve small scale differences
and maintains good continuity from the previous WPC forecast.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Moist flow ahead of the upper trough initially over the eastern
Pacific should continue a Pacific Northwest atmospheric river
event already in progress at the start of the period early
Tuesday.  Amounts during Tuesday-Wednesday should be somewhat
lower than in the short range at the start of the week but could
still be meaningful at some locations.  Some of this moisture will
extend into the northern Rockies.  Progression of the upper trough
into the West after midweek should lead to a lighter trend along
the West Coast and spread precipitation into central California
and some other parts of the West, mostly with light to moderate
amounts of rain and higher elevation snow.  Expect precipitation
to expand across the central U.S. late week into the weekend as
western trough energy reaches far enough east to support Plains
low pressure.  Best potential for some wintry weather will be over
the northern third of the Plains into the Upper Midwest.  Areas
from the Upper Midwest into Northeast may see a couple periods of
snow Tuesday-Thursday in association with clipper systems, the
first one fairly well forecast but the second having much greater
uncertainty for strength/track details.  Thus confidence is a lot
lower for coverage and amounts of snow with the second system.

Above normal temperatures will prevail over a majority of the
western and central U.S. Tuesday-Wednesday.  Progression of the
initial eastern Pacific upper trough will promote a cooler trend
over the West after midweek and then favor northward expansion of
above normal temperatures (plus 10-15F or so anomalies) from the
South across a greater portion of the eastern U.S.  Plus 10-20F
anomalies will be possible for max and/or min temperatures for one
or more days over the Great Basin/Southwest through midweek and
parts of the Rockies/Plains into later in the week.  Central
Plains locations could exceed plus 20F anomalies for highs.  Areas
from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast will tend to be moderately
below normal and colder air filtering into Montana/North Dakota
could bring highs down to 10-20F below normal by next Saturday.

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show an upper pattern consisting of a
western ridge and broad eastern mean trough through midweek,
followed by a transition toward a mean trough settling into the
western U.S. while upper heights rise farther to the east.  The
primary precipitation focus early in the period will be over the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies ahead of the eastern
Pacific trough that eventually moves into the West.  Progression
of this trough later in the week into next weekend will spread
precipitation over other parts of the West and then bring a
variety of precipitation types to the central U.S. as low pressure
emerges over the Plains.  Ahead of this system, expect most
precipitation east of the Rockies to be confined to a couple
episodes of snow across northern areas with associated surface
waves.  The pattern evolution will favor above normal temperatures
over a majority of the western/central U.S. through Wednesday or
Thursday and then a cooler trend over the West and warmer readings
over the East.

...Unsettled weather likely across the Pacific Northwest into
early next week including heavy mountain snow and lower elevation
rain...

...A strong cold front may produce brief bursts of snow and
blustery conditions across the Great Lakes and Northeast on
Sunday...

Precipitation associated with an approaching Pacific system will
continue to spread east across the Pacific Northwest this evening
and through the overnight, before reaching into the northern
Rockies tomorrow morning.  A Winter Storm Warning is in effect for
the Olympics and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for
portions of the northern Cascades, where several inches of heavy
wet snow can be expected by early tomorrow.  This system is
forecast to weaken, however unsettled weather is likely to
continue, with additional heavy precipitation possible through
Monday as another system approaches the region.  Heavy rain
falling across the lower elevations may cause flooding concerns
across portions of western Washington and Oregon on Monday.

Across the South, an upper level disturbance will support
generally light precipitation moving east from eastern Texas and
Oklahoma through the lower Mississippi Valley and into the
Tennessee Valley overnight, before spreading across the southern
Appalachians and into the southern Mid Atlantic tomorrow morning.
Shallow low-level cold air may support a wintry mix from the
ArkLaTex region into the Tennessee Valley.  However, significant
snow or ice accumulations are not expected.

Across the Great Lakes and Northeast, a strong cold front will
sweep across the region tomorrow afternoon and evening.  Snow
squalls are expected to move along and behind the front as it
moves across northern portions of New York and New England.
Brief, but intense snowfall, along with gusty winds, creating
hazardous conditions, can be be expected within these developing
squalls.

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Dry air (characterized by
10-20 percent surface RH) will cover much of the Plains states
tomorrow/Sunday afternoon, where fuels are modestly to highly
receptive to fire spread. Overall weaker forecast surface wind
fields should limit widespread significant wildfire-spread
potential, with no fire weather highlights introduced. However,
localized wildfire-spread concerns exist where the drier surface air
and brief, gusty conditions can overlap the more receptive fuels,
especially over northern Kansas into central Nebraska.

..Squitieri.. 02/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CST Sat Feb 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will build eastward across the central
Rockies, allowing maximum temperatures to climb into the upper 50s
to near 60 over parts of the central and southern Plains. This will
result in widespread minimum afternoon RH below 15 percent, though
surface winds should generally remain below 15 mph where the
greatest RH reductions are expected. The one exception may be over
parts of Montana and Wyoming, where breezy surface winds of 15-20
mph will be possible. However, fire-weather concerns will still
remain low owing to residual snow cover across the region.

Across southern California, dry offshore flow will continue, though
a weakening pressure gradient and minimal upper-level support should
generally mitigate the fire-weather threat.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 26 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

159 AM EST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 02 2022 - 12Z Sun Mar 06 2022

...Overview...

Expect a significant change in the upper level pattern over the
course of the period, with a western U.S. ridge/broad eastern
trough as of Wednesday transitioning toward an amplified northern
Plains through western U.S. trough/eastern ridge configuration by
next weekend.  As this evolution occurs, precipitation over the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will spread across more of
the West, to be followed by a broad area of various precipitation
types developing over the central U.S. as low pressure tracks
through the Plains and Upper Great Lakes.  Early in the period a
northern tier wave may spread some snow across areas from the
Upper Midwest into the Northeast.  Western/central states will see
a pronounced cooler trend in temperatures, from well above normal
to below normal, while above normal temperatures over the southern
half or so of the East should expand northward next weekend.  Far
northern tier areas will tend to be colder than normal on most
days.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The latest cycles of guidance maintain the recent theme of better
than average agreement for the large-scale pattern evolution but
continued differences for some details.  Subtle differences in
evolution of southern Canada energy flowing into/through the
eastern North America mean trough continue to produce greater than
average spread for the specifics of a surface wave that may track
from the Midwest through the Northeast from Wednesday into early
Thursday.  CMC/UKMET runs have consistently been on the stronger
and northern side of the model spread for this wave.  The notable
change in the past day has been with the 00Z GFS/GEFS mean
trending to a slower/weaker version of the CMC/UKMET scenario,
extending a modest trend from the 18Z cycle.  This leaves the 12Z
ECMWF still the new 00Z run on the weak and suppressed side of the
spread.  The preferred solution adjusted the wave's track somewhat
northward from previous cycle given relative support from the
means but maintained a fairly weak depiction due to the
considerable spread.

Meanwhile guidance is still in the process of refining the
forecast of upper troughing that moves into the West.  00Z runs so
far are adding support to the idea of a slightly slower/sharper
lead shortwave reaching the West Coast, leaving the 12Z
ECMWF/ECMWF mean a bit on the faster side.  The new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted slower.  This energy should ultimately cross the West and
eject through the Plains, supporting a Plains through Upper Great
Lakes surface system from late week through the weekend.
Consistent with trends seen farther west, this system has adjusted
a little slower over the past day.  Low-predictability trailing
energy dropping into the mean trough (as eastern Pacific ridging
steadily builds) continues to complicate the forecast of the
leading impulse to some degree.  Still, there is better than
average agreement regarding the fairly deep trough forecast to be
over the West as of day 7 Sunday.

The 12Z/18Z operational model blend used for the first half of the
period provided the desired adjustment for the eastern U.S. wave
while representing an intermediate solution for the shortwave
entering the West.  Then a trend toward more even weight of models
and ensemble means later in the period accounted for the good
pattern agreement but uncertainty in some of the details.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and high elevation snow from the Pacific Northwest/northern
California into northern Rockies as of midweek will spread across
more of the West later in the week, while trending lighter along
the West Coast, as an upper trough moves into and through the
region.  Continued progression of this energy should support a
central Plains into Upper Great Lakes surface low and frontal
system late week into the weekend, with a corresponding broad area
of precipitation over the central U.S.  Best potential for wintry
precipitation types will extend from the northern half of the High
Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England, with
a band of significant snow possible to the northwest of the
surface low track.  Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible
over the rest of the central/east-central U.S.  Well ahead of this
system, a northern tier wave may spread snow across an area from
the Upper Midwest into New England from Wednesday into Thursday.
Thus far guidance has not been agreeable with details of the
surface wave so coverage and amounts of snow have lower than
average confidence.  A lower-probability scenario could lead to a
somewhat farther southward axis.

A majority of the lower 48 will see above normal temperatures on
Wednesday, with areas along the central/eastern Canadian border as
well as the western Gulf Coast being the main exceptions.  Then
the West and northern-central Plains will trend steadily cooler
with time while above normal readings over the southern half of
the East expand northward by next weekend.  Expect the warmest
anomalies of plus 20-25F or so for highs to be over the central
Plains Wednesday through Thursday or Friday.  Other warm areas may
see plus 10-20F anomalies with some locally higher readings
possible.  Northern Plains into Rockies locations may see highs
10-15F below normal by next Sunday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0147 AM CST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel ridge will build eastward across the central Rockies and
adjacent Plains, while a low-amplitude shortwave trough crosses the
northern Rockies along the northern periphery of the ridge. At the
surface, expansive high pressure will remain centered over the
Intermountain West, while weak lee troughing develops over parts of
the northern and central Plains.

...Central and Southern Plains...
As the midlevel ridge overspreads the region, maximum temperatures
will climb into the upper 50s to near 60 across most of the central
and southern Plains. This will result in widespread minimum
afternoon RH of 10-15 percent, though sustained surface winds should
generally remain below 15 mph where fuels are receptive to
wildfire-spread. The one exception may be over parts of northern KS
and NE, where west-northwesterly surface winds could approach 15 mph
amid 10-15 percent RH. However, these conditions appear too marginal
and localized for Elevated highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
Along the southern periphery of the western CONUS surface high, dry
offshore flow will continue across southern California. Over parts
of Ventura and Los Angeles Counties, northeasterly wind gusts of
25-35 mph will overlap 5-15 percent RH during the morning and
afternoon hours. With that said, high live fuel moisture should
generally mitigate the fire-weather threat, though localized
fire-weather concerns will exist where the gusty winds/low RH align
with dead fuels. No highlights will be introduced due to the
localized nature of the threat.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CST Sun Feb 27 2022

Valid 281200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and accompanying enhanced flow aloft will
overspread the Rockies, resulting in lee troughing over the High
Plains -- where a dry antecedent airmass will exist. Farther west, a
midlevel ridge will build over the West Coast, reinforcing surface
high pressure over the Intermountain West and offshore flow over
southern California.

...Central and Southern Plains...
Dry boundary-layer conditions aided by downslope flow will continue
across most of the central and southern Plains, where minimum
afternoon RH of 10-15 percent is expected. Over portions of the
southern High Plains, a few hours of elevated conditions will be
possible, as sustained northerly surface winds near 15 mph develop
amid the critically-low RH. While less certain, breezy
north-northwesterly surface winds will also be possible across the
central Plains, though confidence in the development of sustained 15
mph surface winds is too low to introduce highlights at this time.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient will be maintained over southern
California, while mid/upper-level northeasterly winds strengthen
across the region. This will result in northeasterly wind gusts of
30-50 mph amid 10-15 percent RH over portions of Ventura, Los
Angeles, and Orange Counties. Current indications are that high live
fuel moisture will continue to mitigate the fire-weather threat,
though trends will be monitored closely as fuels continue to dry
across the area.

...Unsettled weather likely across the Pacific Northwest into
early next week including heavy mountain snow and lower elevation
rain...

...A strong cold front may produce brief bursts of snow under
blustery conditions later today across the interior Northeast...

The Pacific Northwest has entered a period of unsettled weather as
multiple systems from the Pacific are forecast to direct moisture
toward the region.  Precipitation across western Washington will
be the heaviest and most sustained through the next couple of
days.  In addition, heavy wet snow is expected to accumulate in
the Washington Cascades.  Heavy rain falling across the lower
elevations may cause flooding concerns across portions of western
Washington and Oregon on Monday into early Tuesday when the
precipitation is expected to be the heaviest.  The associated
moisture will spread farther inland to bring light to moderate
snowfall across the northern Rockies.  Winds are expected increase
especially near the Washington coast and on the lee side of the
Rockies where very gusty downslope winds are forecast to develop.

Across the South, an upper level disturbance will support
generally light precipitation today from the Deep South to the
southern Appalachians and through the southern Mid Atlantic.  The
rain should be exiting the southeast U.S. coast Sunday night as
the associated cold front begins to slide more quickly offshore.

Across the Great Lakes and interior Northeast, a strong arctic
front will move across the region this afternoon into the evening.
 Snow squalls are expected to move along and behind the front as
it moves across northern portions of New York and New England.
Brief, but intense snowfall, along with gusty winds, creating
hazardous conditions, can be be expected within these squalls.
Very cold air will be ushered into New England behind the front
under blustery north to northwesterly winds.  Temperatures are
forecast to dip below zero by Tuesday morning with subsiding winds
as the center of an arctic high approaches.

Snowfall downwind from the lower Great Lakes is expected to be
enhanced today as the arctic front passes through.  Farther west,
low pressure waves forming on the arctic front over northern High
Plains will bring periods of light snow from North Dakota eastward
to the Great Lakes Monday into Tuesday.

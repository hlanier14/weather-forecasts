Prognostic Discussion for Long-Lead Seasonal Outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
830 AM EDT Thu Sep 16 2021

SUMMARY OF THE OUTLOOK FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS

ENSO-neutral conditions are present, as represented in current oceanic and
atmospheric observations. A transition from ENSO-neutral to La-Ni=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDa is
favored
in the next couple of months, with a 70 to 80 percent chance of La Nina dur=
ing
the Northern Hemisphere Winter 2021-22. Conversely, the chances of El Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo
are
exceedingly small, with probabilities less than 5 percent through the upcom=
ing
winter.



The October-November-December (OND) 2021 temperature outlook favors above
normal temperatures for the southern two-thirds of the Contiguous United
States
(CONUS), the eastern third of the CONUS, and western Alaska, with the large=
st
probabilities (greater than 50 percent) forecast across the Southwest and N=
ew
England. The OND 2021 precipitation outlook depicts enhanced probabilities =
of
below normal precipitation amounts across the Southern Tier and much of the
central CONUS. Above-normal precipitation is more likely for the northweste=
rn
CONUS, the Eastern Great Lakes, parts of the interior Northeast, and parts =
of
southwestern Alaska. Equal chances (EC) are forecast for areas where
probabilities for each category of seasonal mean temperatures and seasonal
accumulated precipitation amounts are expected to be similar to climatologi=
cal
probabilities.

BASIS AND SUMMARY OF THE CURRENT LONG-LEAD OUTLOOKS
Note:  For Graphical Displays of the Forecast Tools Discussed Below See:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictio=
ns/90day/tools/briefing__;!!DZ3fjg!ub-Sz8PalYckRGV4Q8sMVUM3pzlSWHFukLq5HDyl=
XqUsREhjUb7WY4TJHa-2jCYrmslaVDaB$

CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC CONDITIONS

The coupled oceanic and atmospheric observations reflect ENSO-neutral
conditions. In the last month, ENSO-neutral continued with near-to-below
average sea surface temperatures (SSTs) persisting in the central and easte=
rn
equatorial Pacific. In the last week, the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 index v=
alue stood at
-0.4=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC.
Negative subsurface temperature anomalies (averaged from 180-100=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDW) remained
steady in August reflecting below-average temperatures that extended from t=
he
surface to ~250m depth in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Low-level wind anomali=
es
were easterly over the western Pacific Ocean, while upper-level wind anomal=
ies
were westerly over the western and east-central Pacific. Tropical convectio=
n
was suppressed near and west of the Date Line and enhanced over Indonesia.
Given these conditions, the ocean-atmosphere system reflects ENSO-neutral, =
but
is edging toward La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa.



The Real-time Multivariate Madden Julian Oscillation (RMM) index depicts a
strengthening signal over the eastern Indian Ocean, where enhanced convecti=
on
has persisted for the past several weeks. There is considerable spread amon=
g
dynamical models on the future evolution of the Madden Julian Oscillation
(MJO). Models generally depict an MJO event crossing the Maritime Continent
but
differ in the strength and evolution of this feature. Thus, uncertainty is
relatively high on the future evolution of the MJO at this time.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF SST FORECASTS

The IRI/CPC plume average of forecasts for the Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4 SS=
T region from the
last month favored borderline or weak La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa during the f=
all and winter
2021-22. The current forecast favors the latest predictions from the NCEP
CFSv2
and the North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME), which suggest higher
chances for the emergence of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa. At this time, La Ni=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa is anticipated
to
be of weak strength (seasonal average Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo-3.4 index value=
s between -0.5=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC
to
-0.9=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDC). In summary, a transition from ENSO-neutral to La =
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa is favored in
the next couple of months, with a 70-80% chance of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa=
 during the
Northern
Hemisphere winter 2021-22.

PROGNOSTIC TOOLS USED FOR U.S. TEMPERATURE AND PRECIPITATION OUTLOOKS

Dynamical model forecasts from the NMME and Copernicus (C3S) multi-model
ensemble systems are used extensively for the first six leads when they are
available, as was the objective, historical skill weighted consolidation, t=
hat
combines both dynamical and statistical forecast tools.



Additionally, the official ENSO forecast depicts probabilities of La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
that
are significantly higher than climatological probabilities through the
upcoming
winter. This anticipated La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa signal played a role in t=
he construction of
these outlooks. At later leads, decadal trends in temperature and
precipitation
were increasingly relied upon in creating the seasonal outlooks.

PROGNOSTIC DISCUSSION OF OUTLOOKS - OND 2021 TO OND 2022

TEMPERATURE

Above normal temperatures are favored throughout a majority of the southern
and
eastern CONUS and western Alaska during OND. Conversely, below normal
temperatures are more likely for southeastern Alaska. Equal chances (EC) of
below, near, or above normal temperatures are forecast for the northwestern
and
north-central CONUS. This EC area is due to weak or conflicting signals amo=
ng
temperature tools. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are increased
relative to last month across the East due to stronger support among the
temperature guidance. Above normal temperatures are especially likely (grea=
ter
than 50 percent) for eastern New England due to good agreement among both
dynamical and statistical guidance. Guidance has trended colder across much=
 of
Alaska relative to last month. Thus, increased probabilities of below norma=
l
temperatures were introduced to southeastern parts of the state, which is a=
lso
consistent with composites from the current ENSO state.



From NDJ through FMA, impacts from the potential La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa b=
ecome more apparent
as above normal temperatures continue to be favored across the Southern CON=
US
and the Eastern Seaboard while enhanced below normal temperature probabilit=
ies
persist across southeastern Alaska and expand southward to the northwestern
CONUS. Thereafter, the forecast pattern increasingly begins to reflect tren=
ds
with above normal temperatures generally favored across most of the souther=
n,
western, and eastern CONUS next spring, summer, and into the fall.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures peak across the West next summer
and
across the Eastern Seaboard next fall, consistent with trends. Across Alask=
a,
above normal temperatures become increasingly likely with time, with the
strongest warm signal emerging next summer, when probabilities of above nor=
mal
temperatures exceed 50 percent for most of the state.

PRECIPITATION

Model guidance remains consistent from previous months depicting elevated
probabilities of below normal precipitation for much of the southern and
central CONUS, and increased chances of above normal precipitation for the
Pacific Northwest during OND. Models are consistent in depicting an expansi=
on
of a dry signal eastward across the Southeast, with influences from potenti=
al
tropical disturbances decreasing and La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa influences in=
creasing as we
progress deeper into the fall and early winter. Conversely, precipitation
guidance has trended wetter across the northwestern CONUS, resulting in an
increase in above normal precipitation probabilities relative to last month=
.
Additionally, an area of slightly increased probabilities of above normal
precipitation was introduced to the Great Lakes region and interior Northea=
st,
consistent with the latest C3S guidance. A slight tilt toward above normal
precipitation is also indicated for parts of southwestern Alaska, based
primarily on dynamical model guidance.  EC is indicated for the rest of the
forecast domain as signals for the various dynamical and statistical tools =
are
too weak or conflicting to issue a forecast with a sufficient degree of
confidence.



As we progress further into late fall and through the winter, dynamical and
statistical guidance persist with a dry signal across the southern CONUS,
consistent with a La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa signature. An eastward expansion=
 of enhanced above
normal precipitation probabilities is noted across the northwestern CONUS, =
as
well as a northward expansion across the Alaska Panhandle, peaking in cover=
age
during the winter. A wet signal is also favored to expand southward from th=
e
Great Lakes to the Ohio Valley during the winter with the strongest signal
evident during JFM, consistent with La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa composites. Du=
ring next spring
through next fall, trends become the dominant factor with increased chances=
 of
above normal precipitation generally indicated across parts of the Eastern
CONUS and Gulf Coast Region through much of the period. Conversely, trends
favor a dry pattern for much of the West next spring and summer, with
increased
chances of dryness for parts of the Northern Plains next summer as well.
Thereafter, an area of slightly enhanced probabilities of above normal
precipitation makes a brief appearance across the Pacific Northwest in ASO,
based primarily on statistical guidance from trends and ENSO. A tilt toward=
 a
dry pattern persists farther to the south across parts of the remainder of =
the
West into next fall, based primarily on trends. There exists high uncertain=
ty
across much of Alaska through the period with large areas of EC indicated.
However, dynamical guidance supports increased odds of above normal
precipitation across parts of the western and northern Mainland through the
MAM
season. Conversely, statistical guidance from trends and ENSO support a sli=
ght
tilt toward below normal precipitation for parts of the South Coast early i=
n
the spring shifting toward the southwestern Mainland later in the spring.
Thereafter, trends support slightly increased chances for above normal
precipitation for parts of the eastern Mainland next summer and slightly
increased chances of below normal precipitation for parts of the Panhandle
next
fall.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook

830 AM EDT Thu Sep 16 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR OCTOBER 2021

The October 2021 outlook is prepared with a backdrop of most likely develop=
ing
La Nina conditions in the equatorial Pacific Ocean both in the ocean and
atmosphere. The MJO, although not as coherent and well defined as during th=
e
months of July and August remains a factor in the outlook as does anteceden=
t
soil moisture conditions and coastal sea surface temperature anomalies.
Statistical, hybrid and dynamical model based forecast guidance contribute
significantly to the October outlook.



For temperature, the outlook depicts favored above-normal monthly mean Octo=
ber
temperatures for much of the contiguous U.S. with the region stretching fro=
m
the Southwest eastward to cover the Great Plains and extending across the O=
hio
Valley, Great Lakes, mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The greatest odds are
generally in the center of this highlighted region for a variety of factors
such as antecedent surface moisture departures from normal, prospects for
potential developing La Nina impacts as well as dynamical model forecast
information. Although the eventual evolution of the MJO and so its impacts =
on
the U.S. are uncertain given its current state, the MJO would favor
above-normal temperatures for much of the central and eastern contiguous U.=
S.
during the first two weeks of October.



Favored unsettled conditions and associated enhanced cloudiness and rainfal=
l
increase uncertainty near the Gulf Coast and so Equal-Chances (EC) is depic=
ted
in this region as well as in the Pacific Northwest where conflicting signal=
s
in
climate forecast tools and information are present.



Favored troughing to the north of Alaska and anomalous north to south
meridional flow supports elevated odds for below-normal temperatures for
portions of interior and southeast Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. This is
supported by much of the available dynamical model guidance as well as
potential impacts from developing La Nina conditions over the next six week=
s.
Above-normal sea surface temperatures in nearby coastal waters for the
Aleutians and southwest Alaska as well as some dynamical model guidance
support
modest odds for above-normal temperatures for southwest Alaska and the
Aleutians.



The October precipitation outlook is influenced by potential background La
Nina
and MJO impacts in some areas as well as both statistical forecast tools an=
d
dynamical model guidance. Elevated odds for below-normal October total
precipitation amounts is depicted for a region from California eastward to
include the Southwest, the central Rockies and the central and southern Gre=
at
Plains -- based on potential La Nina impacts and support from much of the
dynamical model guidance.



The most consistent signal in the forecast tools is for elevated probabilit=
ies
for above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest as depicted by mod=
el
guidance and consistent with La Nina impacts for this time of the year. Thi=
s
signal extends northward to include the Alaska Panhandle. Anticipated
anomalous
north to south meridional flow supports and is the basis for a small,
generally
weak tilt in the odds for below-normal precipitation for the south-central
portion of the state.



Across the eastern CONUS, a region of elevated odds for above-normal
precipitation is depicted from the Gulf coast, eastern seaboard and for par=
ts
of the Great Lakes and Northeast. The southern areas of this highlighted ar=
ea
are primarily based on potential tropical cyclone related impacts linked to
the
climatological secondary peak in tropical cyclone activity in October for
areas
in the northwest Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico. In addition, a potential
factor later in the month could be the MJO influence of above-normal
precipitation in this region linked to MJO RMM phase 8 through 2. The forec=
ast
in this area is at odds for much of the dynamical model guidance where near=
-
to
below-normal monthly precipitation amounts are forecast, thus there is
considerable uncertainty in the forecast in this area.



The forecast for above-normal precipitation further north in the mid-Atlant=
ic,
much of the Great Lakes and Northeast is primarily related to long term
positive precipitation trends and supplemented by signals from some of the
dynamical model forecast output.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1036 AM CDT Thu Sep 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

Main modification was to reduce the northeast Montana elevated
spatially. Given the light showers early this morning and ongoing
currently the area was trimmed on the southern edge. Elevated
conditions are most likely near the Canadian border where cloud
cover will be minimal during the day. Strong winds and briefly low
RH may still extend farther south than highlighted, though.
Elsewhere, the forecast remains unchanged.

..Wendt.. 09/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1148 PM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the
northern Rockies through the day today. Along its southern
periphery, strong mid-level flow (>50 mph) will overspread much of
the northern Rockies and Northern Plains as well as the northern
Great Basin. At the surface, a surface low is forecast to move east
across South Dakota. In addition, a strong cold front will move
southeast across eastern Montana.

...Eastern Montana into far northwest North Dakota...
In the wake of the surface cold front, dry air and at least some
surface heating is expected to allow the relative humidity to drop
into the 20s in portions of eastern Montana and far northwest North
Dakota. Meanwhile, strong northwest surface winds of 20 to 25 mph
are expected across this same region during the afternoon hour.

...Snake River Plain...
A well-mixed boundary layer is expected across the Great Basin this
afternoon. Some stronger winds are expected to mix to the surface in
the Snake River Plain where mid-level flow will be parallel to the
river valley and where stronger winds aloft are expected.

...Southern Nevada across Utah and into southern Wyoming and
northwest Colorado...
A well-mixed boundary layer is expected across much of the Great
Basin this afternoon. Slightly stronger mid-level flow (~25 mph) is
expected in a region from the southern Great Basin into the northern
Rockies. Given the deep mixing that is expected, some of this
stronger flow is expected to reach the surface with 15 to 20 mph
surface winds forecast across a broad portion of the southern Great
Basin and central Rockies.

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 19 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 23 2021


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

 Elsewhere across the CONUS, high pressure is forecast to be the
dominant feature for the East Coast through the middle of next
week.

Ridging will remain in place over much of the East and Southeast
during the extended period while an amplified trough tracks from
the Pacific Northwest to the north-central states. In general, the
large scale pattern and its evolution have been in fairly good
agreeance the first couple of days, but the spread in timing and
location increases beyond day 5 particularly for the
trough/surface front near the Northern Plains and Great Lakes
region. This trend has been persistent that past 4 or 5 days. A
majority of the guidance show a flattening trough, therefore a
more progressive system to move trough the Pacific Northwest and
Intermountain West into the Plains. Previous runs of the ECMWF
advertised a slower trough that eventually cuts off over the
Plains; and now, the GFS and CMC solutions are hinting at this
posibility but not for the same time periods.  The preferred blend
for this forecast consisted of nearly equal weights for day 3-5 of
the ECWMF, GFS and CMC with increasing percentages of the ensemble
means for day 6 and 7 to account for some of the uncertainty in
the northern Plains and Great Lakes.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Warm, moist air will surge northward from the Gulf of Mexico prior
to the trough and associated deepening low pressure system that
will cross the Intermountain West and enter into the Northern
Plains by early next week. As such, the daily temperatures will be
warmer than average and with the mositure surge there will also be
scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms. Parts of the Gulf
region may have periods of heavier rainfall. The greatest
temperature departures from normal will be for the northern tier
and Upper Midwest where daily highs 10F to 20F above normal will
be possible.

A significant drop in temperatures can be expected across the
Northwest and northern tier states as a "season-changing" cold
front passes through. Scattered to widespread rain will shift from
the Northwest coastal areas inland toward the Intermountain West.
Some of the highest peaks may have snow as the heights and
temperatures fall. Maximum temperatures of 10F to as much as 20F
below normal will be  possible Sunday and Monday across the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West. In contrast, the daily
lows across the CONUS are largely forecast to be above normal,
with some significant departures from normal likely Sunday into
early next week across the northern tier and Great Lakes. Lows 15F
to 20F above normal are possible.

therefore today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa height blend til=
ts toward the more
amplified
ECMWF ensemble. Specifically, the blend depicts positive height anomalies
across much of the western CONUS, and near normal heights over much of the
east-central CONUS including the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Above normal
heights remain favored over the Northeast due to increased southerly mid-le=
vel
flow forecast ahead of the trough axis. Below normal heights are forecast o=
ver
most of Alaska underneath the predicted troughing.

Increased probabilities for above normal temperatures are favored across th=
e
Eastern Seaboard, on the front side of the troughing initially forecast ove=

the Great Lakes. This troughing favors near normal temperatures over much o=
f
the Great Lakes and the Ohio, Tennessee, and Mississippi Valleys. A slight
tilt
toward increased below normal temperature probabilities is highlighted acro=
ss
the Lower Mississippi Valley, consistent with the ECMWF reforecast tool, an=
d
also as a result of increased soil moisture due to antecedent rainfall from
the
remnant of Hurricane Nicholas. Some areas of below normal temperatures are
possible across the western CONUS as shortwave troughing propagates through
the
region early in the period, but a trend toward warmer temperatures is forec=

by the end of the period. As a result, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs fo=
recast features enhanced
probabilities for near to above normal temperatures for the period as a who=

over most of the West, with near to below normal temperatures remaining
favored
over portions of the Great Basin and Southwest with increased uncertainty
related to the potential for a cut-off low. Troughing and below normal 500-=

height anomalies forecast over Alaska favors increased probabilities of bel=
ow
normal temperatures over much of the state. The temperature forecast is
generally supported by both the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools, with the
ECMWF
being on the cooler side across the east-central CONUS due to the stronger
depiction of the trough.

The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally agree on a dry pattern for mu=

CONUS favors increased probabilities for above normal precipitation over mo=

increases odds of above normal precipitation over parts of southeastern Ala=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 24 - 30 2021

Dynamical models favor a trend toward more broad ridging across the CONUS
during week-2, with a weakness in the mid-level flow forecast across the Ea=
st,
most evident in the 0z ECMWF ensemble. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs we=
ek-2 manual 500-hPa height
blend gives most weight to the 0z ECMWF ensemble, and also includes the 6z
deterministic GFS, which has been fairly consistent showing a more amplifie=
d
ridge in the West, and weaker height anomalies in the East. The blend
indicates
the largest positive height anomalies over the central and western CONUS,
consistent with forecast ridging, and near normal heights along the East
Coast.
Near to below normal heights remain forecast for much of Mainland Alaska an=
d
the Panhandle due to continued influence from troughing. Positive height
anomalies are forecast to become favored across the Aleutians and the extre=
me
western Mainland as the troughing weakens and shifts further east allowing
ridging to build over the Bering Sea.

The broad ridge pattern favored across the CONUS favors increased
probabilities
for above normal temperatures and below normal precipitation over most area=
s,
supported by the consolidation forecast tool. Probabilities for near to bel=
ow
normal temperatures are enhanced across the parts of the Tennessee Valley,
Lower Mississippi Valley, and Southeast, supported by the ECMWF reforecast
tool
and antecedent wet conditions as noted in the 6-10 day discussion. Increase=
d
probabilities for below normal temperatures also remain favored across most=
 of
Alaska underneath the predicted troughing, with the exception being across =
the
Aleutians where probabilities for above normal temperatures are increased d=
ue
to a trend toward more ridging over the region. The eastward progression of
the
trough over the Gulf of Alaska and eventually closer to the west coast of
British Columbia favors increased chances for above normal precipitation
across
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. Near to below normal
precipitation probabilities are increased for the remainder of the state, o=

the backside of the trough.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

 Elsewhere across the CONUS, high pressure is forecast to be the
dominant feature for the East Coast through the middle of next
week.

Ridging will remain in place over much of the East and Southeast
during the extended period while an amplified trough tracks from
the Pacific Northwest to the north-central states. In general, the
large scale pattern and its evolution have been in fairly good
agreeance the first couple of days, but the spread in timing and
location increases beyond day 5 particularly for the
trough/surface front near the Northern Plains and Great Lakes
region. This trend has been persistent that past 4 or 5 days. A
majority of the guidance show a flattening trough, therefore a
more progressive system to move trough the Pacific Northwest and
Intermountain West into the Plains. Previous runs of the ECMWF
advertised a slower trough that eventually cuts off over the
Plains; and now, the GFS and CMC solutions are hinting at this
posibility but not for the same time periods.  The preferred blend
for this forecast consisted of nearly equal weights for day 3-5 of
the ECWMF, GFS and CMC with increasing percentages of the ensemble
means for day 6 and 7 to account for some of the uncertainty in
the northern Plains and Great Lakes.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Warm, moist air will surge northward from the Gulf of Mexico prior
to the trough and associated deepening low pressure system that
will cross the Intermountain West and enter into the Northern
Plains by early next week. As such, the daily temperatures will be
warmer than average and with the mositure surge there will also be
scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms. Parts of the Gulf
region may have periods of heavier rainfall. The greatest
temperature departures from normal will be for the northern tier
and Upper Midwest where daily highs 10F to 20F above normal will
be possible.

A significant drop in temperatures can be expected across the
Northwest and northern tier states as a "season-changing" cold
front passes through. Scattered to widespread rain will shift from
the Northwest coastal areas inland toward the Intermountain West.
Some of the highest peaks may have snow as the heights and
temperatures fall. Maximum temperatures of 10F to as much as 20F
below normal will be  possible Sunday and Monday across the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West. In contrast, the daily
lows across the CONUS are largely forecast to be above normal,
with some significant departures from normal likely Sunday into
early next week across the northern tier and Great Lakes. Lows 15F
to 20F above normal are possible.

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

Portions of the northern Rockies will see unfavorable overlap of
stronger winds and lowered RH during the afternoon. The strongest
winds are most likely from southwestern into northern Montana where
mid-level winds will be strong. A secondary area of strong winds is
expected to develop in eastern Montana and parts of the western
Dakotas as the Canadian surface low deepens. Areas between these
areas are most likely to see more marginal and brief fire weather
concerns.

A shortwave trough off the southern California coast will impact
parts of southern/central Nevada tomorrow afternoon. There appears
to be a brief window where critical conditions could occur as winds
strengthen in response to the feature. However, some moisture return
northward is also anticipated. This reduces confidence in several
hours of critical fire weather.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1150 PM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Friday, a strong mid-level jet streak is expected to move toward
the Pacific Northwest as a strong mid-level trough approaches the
coast. Meanwhile, weak ridging is expected to amplify across
portions of the Southwest. This will increase mid-level flow through
the day across much of the western CONUS. Meanwhile, an area of
surface high pressure is expected to settle into the central Plains
with cyclogenesis in the lee of the Canadian Rockies. This will
tighten the surface pressure gradient, especially across the
central/northern Rockies and the northern Plains. Significant
surface heating, and deep boundary-layer heating is forecast across
much of the western CONUS on Friday. Therefore, a large area is
expected to see increasing surface winds during the afternoon, as
the mid-level flow strengthens and some flow is transported to the
surface in the well-mixed environment. The strongest surface winds
are expected across portions of the northern Plains, where the
surface pressure gradient is also contributing to the increasing
surface winds.

...Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas will continue to bring a threat
of locally heavy rain and flash flooding to portions of the Gulf
Coast states over the next couple of days...

...Severe thunderstorms will be possible late this afternoon and
this evening across Minnesota into southeast South Dakota and
parts of Nebraska...

...First atmospheric river of the season will bring very
beneficial and welcomed rains to drought and wildfire-stricken
areas of the Pacific Northwest going into the weekend...

...Very warm, windy, and dry conditions will maintain a wildfire
threat across many areas of the Intermountain West and the
northern High Plains for the next couple of days...

Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas continue to linger over far
southern Louisiana this afternoon and should very slowly move
northward over the next couple of days before then dissipating.
The system will continue to bring areas of locally heavy showers
and thunderstorms to portions of the Gulf Coast states for the
next couple of days. This will drive concerns for some additional
flash flooding, and the Weather Prediction Center has depicted a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall for the central Gulf Coast
region stretching from southeast Louisiana east to the western
Florida Panhandle.

Meanwhile, a cold front currently settling southeast across the
central and northern Plains and adjacent areas of the upper
Midwest will bring scattered thunderstorms late this afternoon and
evening across this region, and there will be a threat for some of
these thunderstorms to be severe. In fact, the Storm Prediction
Center has depicted a Slight Risk of severe weather going into the
evening hours across Minnesota, southeast South Dakota, and parts
of Nebraska with concerns for supercell thunderstorms that will be
capable of producing large hail, damaging winds, and a few
tornadoes. As the front moves through the Great Lakes region on
Friday and the Ohio Valley early this weekend, there will be
additional scattered areas of showers and thunderstorms associated
with it, but severe weather is generally not anticipated across
these areas at this time.

A well-defined atmospheric river associated with a strong low
pressure system advancing through the Gulf of Alaska will begin
impacting the Pacific Northwest by early Friday morning and will
continue doing so through the weekend. This is the first
atmospheric river of the season and it is expected to bring
locally several inches to the coastal ranges of Washington and
Oregon, and also interior areas of the Cascades. Rain should
advance down into at least northern California including the
northern Sierra-Nevada by late in the weekend. This will be very
beneficial and welcomed rain given the current widespread drought
conditions and ongoing wildfire activity.

This system will move into the Rockies by Sunday and much colder
temperatures will settle in behind the frontal passage across the
Northwest which will yield temperatures of as much as 15 to 20
degrees below average for this time of the year by the end of the
weekend. Conversely, the temperatures out ahead of the cold front
will be quite warm and this will result in a large area of the
central and northern High Plains seeing temperatures at least 15
to 20 degree above average. The very warm, windy and dry
conditions expected ahead of the cold front will also yield an
elevated threat of wildfire activity from areas of the
Intermountain West east into the northern High Plains, and there
are currently Red Flag Warnings in effect to address the wildfire
concerns over the next couple of days.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: A transient pattern is anticipated for week-2, with a series of
mid-level lows traversing across the lower 48. Generally, the progressive
pattern should keep extremes of temperature and precipitation at bay, or at
least short-lived. Over Alaska, the upper-level pattern will be more amplif=
ied
and persistent. This could lead to wintry cold in northern parts of the sta=
te,
especially early. Farther south, a series of storms will impact southern
Alaska. Heavy precipitation could extend as far west as the Anchorage area,
but
odds are better that impactful precipitation will affect Panhandle. There,
precipitation looks to be heavier and of longer duration.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of northern Mainlan=
d
Alaska, Fri-Sat, Sep 24-25.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for the Alaska Panhandle southeastern
Mainland Alaska, Fri-Sun, Sep 24-26.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY SEPTEMBER 19 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 23:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!pGn64MohHn046h2_9cGiHMpqup1mbperLTkfYOey2Ci3BfZ-Vax1T0kBOrfyW=
CW8iynY2wbS$

FOR FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 24 - THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 30: Almost all models agree th=
at
a
significant positive 500-mb height anomaly will be centered somewhere from
northern Scandinavia to north-central Russia for the week as a whole, and m=
ost
have a less-amplified but still formidable ridge centered somewhere west of
Alaska. The implications for conditions in North America are uncertain, but
are
unlikely to be extreme. Regardless the details, all models keep a flat
upper-level mean pattern over the contiguous states, which seems driven by =
a
progressive, moderate flow where upper-level ridges and troughs don't settl=
e
into any fixed position. They are of low amplitude, and move systematically
across the lower 48 states. This brings mild weather to most of the contigu=
ous
states. No large north-south deviations in the upper levels of the atmosphe=
re
means no deep storms and no extremes of temperature. No amplified ridges wi=
ll
bring protracted or unseasonable heat to the CONUS, and no sharp troughs wi=
ll
bring in Arctic air from the north.



There are scenarios that could bring moderate precipitation to parts of the
Atlantic Seaboard and the western Gulf Coast region as some tropical moistu=
re
gets pulled into these areas from the Atlantic, but only the 00Z Canadian
ensemble depicts above normal precipitation, while most other models keep
subnormal precipitation in those areas, along with much of the rest of the
country. The bottom line is, there is nothing pointing toward any kind of
extreme weather in the contiguous states during this 7-day period, and no
potential week-2 hazards are identified.



A more amplified pattern will likely affect Alaska, with a moderate amplifi=
ed
ridge west of the state allowing cold air to settle into northern sections
while a series of storms progress along the southern coastline. This is not=
 an
unusual pattern this time of year, but it does pose the threat of bringing
unseasonably cold air into northern parts of the state justifying a continu=
ed
slight risk for much below normal temperatures on Sep 24-25. Periods of hea=
vy
precipitation and storminess are forecast to impact the southern tier,
especially on the eastern side. Heavy precipitation could affect areas as f=
ar
west as Anchorage for at least a short time, but the Panhandle and adjacent
areas are most likely to be impacted by heavy precipitation where a slight
risk
for heavy precipitation is highlighted for Sep 24-26. Precipitation looks t=
o
be
heavier and longer-lasting there than further west, with those areas minima=
lly
affected by a second storm that pushes east from the North Pacific Ocean.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 AM CDT Fri Sep 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Widespread elevated fire weather conditions are likely this
afternoon across portions of the Great Basin, northern Sierra, and
northern Rockies. This activity will largely be driven by
strengthening mid and upper-level flow across the West as an upper
trough shifts into the Pacific Northwest. A modest surge of moisture
into the southern Great Basin will introduce the potential for
scattered showers and thunderstorms for southern NV.

...northern Sierra...
The approach of the upper-level wave into the Pacific Northwest will
induce broad surface pressure falls across eastern WA/OR and
northwest NV. In response, west to southwesterly winds will increase
to around 15 mph. Terrain influences will likely result in stronger
winds in the immediate lee of the Sierra. Downslope warming and
drying will support RH reductions into the teens, and possibly upper
single digits. While elevated conditions are likely, modest fuel
readiness will yield an overall modest fire weather threat.

...Great Basin to southern Wyoming...
A weak upper-level wave noted in morning water-vapor imagery will
shift into the southern Great Basin through the day. Strengthening
southerly downslope flow will result in breezy conditions across
southern NV. Winds between 15-20 mph will likely coincide with RH
reductions into the 10-15% range during the early afternoon hours.
Elevated conditions appear probable, and a few locations in southern
NV may see transient critical conditions. Increasing
rain/thunderstorm chances during the late afternoon and evening
hours may limit the duration of the threat and aid in RH recoveries.
Further to the northeast, more localized elevated conditions are
expected across UT and southwest WY, but may linger well into the
late afternoon hours.

...northern Rockies...
Lee troughing in the lee of the Canadian Rockies juxtaposed next to
a surface high over the northern Plains will support strengthening
southerly winds across the northern Rockies. Sustained winds between
15-20 mph are likely with gusts up to 25-30 mph possible. An
unseasonably dry air mass over MT coupled with some downslope
influences will yield RH values in the single digits to low teens,
supporting elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions. The
highest potential for critical conditions will reside across
northeast ID into adjacent areas of MT where fuels are near the 97th
percentile, RH values below 10% are likely, and terrain influences
will support pockets of 20+ mph winds. However, confidence in the
coverage and duration of these conditions remains too low for a
critical area.

230 AM EDT Fri Sep 17 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 20 2021 - 12Z Fri Sep 24 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

The strong storm system that is currently approaching the Pacific
Northwest is expected to be over the central and northern Plains
by Monday morning, accompanied by a rather strong cold front that
should steadily progress across the central and then eastern U.S.
The large surface high and upper ridge across the eastern U.S.
will eventually give way to the approaching trough and cold front,
which will herald a pattern change for much of the eastern half of
the nation.  In addition, a second storm system is forecast to
reach the northwestern U.S. by Wednesday and into Thursday as the
storm track across the northeast Pacific remains active next week.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The deterministic guidance is in above average agreement for the
beginning of next week, with the 18/00Z GFS beginning to show a
faster solution by Tuesday night with the trough/cold front
crossing the Great Lakes and Midwest region.  This is even more
apparent with the second trough crossing the northern Rockies and
northern Plains by Thursday, and also ahead of its own ensemble
mean.  By next Friday, model spread becomes substantial across
much of the northern tier states and southern Canada, with much of
this owing to the eventual evolution of a possible closed upper
low over southern Manitoba as the second Pacific trough moves
inland.

The WPC front/pressures forecast was primarily based on a nearly
equal blend of the 12Z deterministic guidance through early
Wednesday, and then primarily the 12Z GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means through Thursday and Friday.  The 12Z
run of the GFS was substituted for the 18Z run since the latter
was considerably faster with the cold front across the eastern
U.S. compared to the model consensus, whereas the former is more
in line with the CMC/UKMET/ECMWF.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms are expected to
develop along and ahead of the cold front from the Midwest to the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, with some locations getting on
the order of 1 to 2 inches of rainfall with locally higher totals
possible.  Some strong to severe storms will also be possible
where favorable parameters of wind shear and instability exist,
although location specifics are uncertain.  Winter weather will
also be likely across the higher terrain of northern Wyoming and
western Montana with accumulating snow likely on Monday, followed
by a drier weather pattern by Tuesday and beyond.  There may also
be enhanced fire weather concerns for portions of the West,
depending on the magnitude of the pressure gradient and resulting
winds in the wake of the cold front.

It will still feel like summer across much of the southern Plains
and extending northward to the Great Lakes and the Ohio Valley to
begin the week, and more like late October across much of the
Rockies and Intermountain West with highs running 10 to 20 degrees
below average.  These cooler temperatures are expected to reach
the Midwest by midweek and finally to the East Coast by Thursday
and Friday, along with much more pleasant humidity levels.

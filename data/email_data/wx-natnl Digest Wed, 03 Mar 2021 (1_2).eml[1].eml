Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1012 AM CST Tue Mar 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

An elevated fire-weather area has been added across central Kansas
for this outlook.  Southwesterly surface winds ranging from 10-20
mph will develop during the day, while insolation/heating lowers RH
values into the 14-22% range during peak heating hours.  Dry
grasses/finer fuels will support a risk of fire spread during the
afternoon and early evening.

..Cook.. 03/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0146 AM CST Tue Mar 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
A surface low will traverse southern Saskatchewan and Manitoba
through the day today. The pressure gradient associated with this
surface low will lead to some breezy conditions across the northern
Plains. However, relative humidity is not expected to be that low,
and fuels are still moist in the area. Therefore, fire weather
concerns are minimal. In addition, some winds of 10 to 15 mph are
expected amid dry surface conditions from northeast New Mexico
across the TX/OK Panhandles and into southwest Kansas, as weak lee
troughing occurs in eastern Colorado. Winds are expected to remain
too light to warrant an elevated delineation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1114 AM CST Tue Mar 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

A fairly intense upper low will migrate onshore across California,
spreading intense low- and mid-level flow across much of Arizona and
vicinity.  Most areas will likely lack moist fuels for any extensive
fire-weather threat, and mid-level cloudiness may also limit
boundary layer mixing during peak heating hours.  Ongoing drought
suggest, however, that a few areas will have dormant fuels
supportive of fire spread.  Given widespread areas of 20-30 mph
surface winds (with a few higher gusts) and a dry low-level airmass,
an elevated fire-weather area has been added.  Moist advection on
the southern extent of this elevated area (mainly in Arizona) may
limit the extent of very low RH there.

..Cook.. 03/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CST Tue Mar 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact upper low is expected to move into southern California on
Wednesday. This will lead to strengthening flow across the Southwest
and Great Basin. Some dry and breezy conditions are expected from
southwest Arizona into the Great Basin. However, fuels in this
region are not dry enough for any fire weather concern. Elsewhere
light winds should mitigate any threat for large fires.

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 05 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Initially the upper level pattern over the CONUS is expected to be
characterized by troughing along both coasts with a compact
shortwave trough over the Southern Plains. That system is forecast
to quickly move toward the Southeast and become absorbed into the
developing longwave trough over the East Coast this weekend while
the West Coast energy traverses the Rockies and weakens as it
opens up into the Plains Sunday. Reinforcing shortwave troughing
will then settle over the West Coast early next week while
downstream ridging flattens out east of the Rockies. From a
sensible weather perspective, focus of precipitation will be along
the Southeast/Florida early in the period while the West Coast,
particularly the Pacific Northwest, remains unsettled to active.
Temperature anomalies will be noteworthy for the Northern Plains.

This cycle model guidance showed just average agreement through
day 5 with the progression of the shortwave energies from the
Plains to the Southeast and West Coast through the Rockies. The
GFS was considerably faster than the consensus (UKMET met was
equally as slow) and it showed a faster/flatter progression of
shortwave energy coming into the Plains by day 5. The 12Z run
showed a similar solution which is decidedly different from
consensus and the other ensemble means. Its inclusion in the WPC
blend was considerably less compared to the more favorable
ECMWF/CMC which showed a slightly more amplified idea. This
muddles the forecast for day 5-7 east of the Rockies where either
more ridging or a flatter quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Meanwhile,
for the West Coast, guidance shows fairly good agreement in
another shortwave trough settling along the coast by late this
weekend into next week. Overall, the WPC blend was initialized
with mostly a ECMWF heavy component with inclusion of the CMC and
GFS. By day 6-7, mostly ECMWF/ECENS was incorporated with some
inclusion of the GEFS.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Southern Plains upper low will weaken/fill as it becomes
absorbed into the longwave trough over the East Coast this
weekend. Its associated surface low, compact and quick moving,
will bring a period moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall to
portions of Florida, particularly portions of the northern/central
peninsula where the combination of daytime heating, available
moisture, and lift interact. This wave will then deepen as it
moves well offshore and cooler, Canadian high pressure builds
across the entire East Coast.

With troughing expected through most of the period across the
Pacific Northwest, expect generally unsettled weather with
frequent periods of precipitation. Overall, each individual system
could produce some moderate to locally heavy precipitation and the
cumulative effect over the period is for several inches of
precipitation mainly confined to the extreme coastal ares of
northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

Much above normal to near record warm temperatures are forecast
Friday, this weekend, and early next week for portions of the
Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Daytime highs in the 60s
(nearing 70F in South Dakota) will be 20-30F above normal for this
time of year. Nighttime lows may stay above freezing Saturday and
Sunday and this would be 10-20F above normal. Some records could
be broken for daytime highs and lows. These warm temperatures will
gradually spread toward the Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic early next week though will likely moderate some
(anomalies 10-15F). Below normal readings are forecast for the
West Coast late this weekend into next week.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
109 PM EST Tue Mar 02 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Mar 05 2021 - 12Z Tue Mar 09 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Initially the upper level pattern over the CONUS is expected to be
characterized by troughing along both coasts with a compact
shortwave trough over the Southern Plains. That system is forecast
to quickly move toward the Southeast and become absorbed into the
developing longwave trough over the East Coast this weekend while
the West Coast energy traverses the Rockies and weakens as it
opens up into the Plains Sunday. Reinforcing shortwave troughing
will then settle over the West Coast early next week while
downstream ridging flattens out east of the Rockies. From a
sensible weather perspective, focus of precipitation will be along
the Southeast/Florida early in the period while the West Coast,
particularly the Pacific Northwest, remains unsettled to active.
Temperature anomalies will be noteworthy for the Northern Plains.

This cycle model guidance showed just average agreement through
day 5 with the progression of the shortwave energies from the
Plains to the Southeast and West Coast through the Rockies. The
GFS was considerably faster than the consensus (UKMET met was
equally as slow) and it showed a faster/flatter progression of
shortwave energy coming into the Plains by day 5. The 12Z run
showed a similar solution which is decidedly different from
consensus and the other ensemble means. Its inclusion in the WPC
blend was considerably less compared to the more favorable
ECMWF/CMC which showed a slightly more amplified idea. This
muddles the forecast for day 5-7 east of the Rockies where either
more ridging or a flatter quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Meanwhile,
for the West Coast, guidance shows fairly good agreement in
another shortwave trough settling along the coast by late this
weekend into next week. Overall, the WPC blend was initialized
with mostly a ECMWF heavy component with inclusion of the CMC and
GFS. By day 6-7, mostly ECMWF/ECENS was incorporated with some
inclusion of the GEFS.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Southern Plains upper low will weaken/fill as it becomes
absorbed into the longwave trough over the East Coast this
weekend. Its associated surface low, compact and quick moving,
will bring a period moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall to
portions of Florida, particularly portions of the northern/central
peninsula where the combination of daytime heating, available
moisture, and lift interact. This wave will then deepen as it
moves well offshore and cooler, Canadian high pressure builds
across the entire East Coast.

With troughing expected through most of the period across the
Pacific Northwest, expect generally unsettled weather with
frequent periods of precipitation. Overall, each individual system
could produce some moderate to locally heavy precipitation and the
cumulative effect over the period is for several inches of
precipitation mainly confined to the extreme coastal ares of
northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

Much above normal to near record warm temperatures are forecast
Friday, this weekend, and early next week for portions of the
Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Daytime highs in the 60s
(nearing 70F in South Dakota) will be 20-30F above normal for this
time of year. Nighttime lows may stay above freezing Saturday and
Sunday and this would be 10-20F above normal. Some records could
be broken for daytime highs and lows. These warm temperatures will
gradually spread toward the Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic early next week though will likely moderate some
(anomalies 10-15F). Below normal readings are forecast for the
West Coast late this weekend into next week.

300 PM EST March 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is forecast over the western contiguous U.=
S.
resulting in enhanced onshore flow and chances for heavy precipitation acro=
ss
California early in the period. As the mid-level low shifts further inland,
the
risk for heavy precipitation is forecast to diminish, but cold temperatures
are
forecast to become more prevalent across portions of the western lower-48
states. Downstream, mid-level high pressure is forecast across portions of =
the
central and eastern lower-48 states. An active frontal region may set up
across
the central CONUS in between the mid-level high and low pressure areas.
Transient mid-level flow is favored across Alaska with intermittent surface
lows forecast to impact the western and southern parts of the state through=
out
the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of California, Wed-Thu, Mar 10=

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MARCH 05 - TUESDAY MARCH 09:

4o2EkCSdNWq$

FOR WEDNESDAY MARCH 10 - TUESDAY MARCH 16: At the onset of the week-2 perio=
d,
the 6z GEFS, 0z ECMWF, and 0z Canadian ensembles are in good agreement in
regards to mid-level troughing moving into the western CONUS, with the GEFS
depicting a quicker progression compared to the other models. The trough is
forecast to take on a positive tilt, thereby directing the most anomalous
onshore flow across California early in week-2. The ECMWF reforecast tool
depicts probabilities of at least 20% for 3-day precipitation totals to exc=
eed
the 85th percentile across parts of California. Compared to yesterdays
guidance, the GEFS reforecast tool no longer depicts these enhanced
probabilities, likely due to its quicker inland progression of the trough
axis. Given the continued support by the ECMWF reforecast tool, the slight
risk
for heavy precipitation is maintained across most of California for 3/10-3/=
11.
Periods of heavy snow are possible across the Sierra Nevadas, and an
accompanying slight risk for heavy snow hazard is depicted for 3/10.
Thereafter, the onshore flow is forecast to weaken across Northern and Cent=
ral
California, favoring decreasing chances of heavy snowfall.



As the trough axis shifts further inland, colder air is forecast to build
across most of the CONUS west of the Rockies. The ECMWF is slower than the
GEFS
in terms of timing, but both tools show at least a 20% chance that minimum
temperatures fall below the 15th percentile throughout the period over part=
s
of
the West. The GEFS reforecast tool is more expansive with higher probabilit=
ies
extending through the Great Basin and into the Rockies, with the ECMWF
reforecast tool confined to mostly California. For now, the slight risk of
much
below normal temperatures is depicted across parts of the Pacific Northwest=
,
Great Basin, California, and the Southwest, as a compromise between the two
tools. Much of the anomalous cold is forecast to be associated with maximum
temperatures, but subfreezing overnight temperatures are favored across mos=
t
of
the highlighted area, with minimum temperatures over some of the mountainou=
s
regions possibly falling into the teens (deg F). Although slightly warmer
temperatures are forecast across the California Central Valley, patchy fros=
t
will be a concern with overnight temperatures possibly dropping below 40 de=
g
F.



This same trough axis is also forecast to result in one or more areas of
surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies during week-2. Impacts wil=
l
be
dependent on the exact track and strength of the lows, but increased chance=
s
of
heavy precipitation are likely across portions of the Northern Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Tennessee Valley, and the Ohio Valley wher=
e
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools both continue to depict at least a 20%
chance that 3-day precipitation totals exceed the 85th percentile. A slight
risk for heavy precipitation is posted across these regions for all of week=
-2.
Although the greatest potential looks to be in the early part of the period
based on the reforecast tools, the synoptic pattern supports the heavy
precipitation potential through the end of the period. Wintry precipitation=
 is
possible on the northwestern side of these systems, with increased frontal
convergence and rain favored in the warm sector to the southeast of the
surface
low tracks.



Increased wind speeds are possible across portions of the east-central CONU=
S
ahead of the aforementioned frontal systems. Although hazardous wind
thresholds
are not anticipated to be reached, the enhanced southwesterly flow and the
associated warm air advection should yield unseasonably warm temperatures f=
or
parts of the East, especially early in the period, with many areas possibly
having maximum temperatures at least 10 deg F above normal.



A transient pattern is forecast across Alaska, with zonal flow developing
across the state. This favors multiple surface low pressure systems to impa=
ct
the Aleutians and Mainland Alaska during week-2. Given that temperatures ar=
e
also likely to average below normal, increased snowfall is also favored
especially across southwestern Mainland Alaska. The surface lows crossing t=
he
Bering Sea are likely to increase the risk of high winds along the coast of
the
southwestern Mainland and over the Aleutians, however, wind speeds are not
forecast to reach hazards thresholds.

...Gusty winds and frigid wind chills expected in the Northeast
tonight, along with snow in the Rockies and interior Northeast
through Wednesday...

...Warm up continues across Central U.S. while Northeast cools
down...

A low pressure system, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, will
produce rain and thunderstorms across much of the Southeast
through tomorrow morning before exiting into the Atlantic. Showers
may linger across southern Florida during the day tomorrow.
Between 1-2 inches of rain is expected for the region with
isolated amounts surpassing 3 inches possible over parts of
southern South Carolina. In the meantime, a system moving across
southern Ontario will generate snow for parts of Upstate New York
and Vermont. A general area of 3-6 inches of snow is expected with
locally higher amounts possible. There's an Elevated Area of Fire
Risk over parts of the Central Plains tonight as dry air moves
into the region. Much of the central and western U.S. will
experience above average temperatures on Wednesday with parts of
the Northern Plains seeing high temperatures peak between 20-30
degrees above average.

A new low pressure system is forecast to emerge over southern
California tomorrow. This system will produce light rain across
the Southwest on Wednesday and snow over the Central/Southern
Rockies on Thursday, before strengthening over the Southern Plains
on Thursday night. Snow totals over the Central/Southern Rockies
should be between 3-6 inches with some isolated areas seeing near
a foot. Rain and thunderstorms may spread out ahead of this system
over the Central Southern Plains Thursday evening into Friday. A
complex system will arrive over the Pacific Northwest on Thursday
night. Another Elevated Fire Weather area is in effect for parts
of the Desert Southwest as increasing winds and dry conditions
increase fire chances on Wednesday. The Northeast will cool down
as the Northern Plains remains well above average as far as high
temperatures go on Thursday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Tue March 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 08 - 12 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across North America during the 6-10 day period. Negative 500-hPa
height anomalies are forecast to be centered over the Bering Strait and ext=
end
across much of Mainland Alaska. Positive mid-level height anomalies are
forecast over parts of the eastern Aleutians, the southeastern Mainland, an=
d
the Panhandle, associated with mean ridging over the Northeast Pacific. Ove=
r
the CONUS, troughing is favored in the West. Mean ridging and positive 500-=
hPa
height anomalies are favored over the eastern CONUS.

Mid-level negative height anomalies favor increased probabilities of
below-normal temperatures along the Bering Sea coast, extending southeastwa=
rd
to the Alaska Panhandle. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal temperature=
s
along the West Coast eastward to the Rockies are associated with mean
troughing
and below-normal mid-level heights. East of the Rockies, amplified ridging
favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal temperatures across much of t=
he
central and eastern CONUS, with the highest probabilities (>90%) over the
Great
Lakes.

Enhanced onshore flow favors above-normal precipitation across much of Alas=
ka.
Mean troughing centered over the West Coast increases probabilities of
above-normal precipitation over most of the western CONUS. Enhanced
above-normal precipitation probabilities extend into the Central and Northe=
rn
Plains and the Midwest, associated with low pressure systems that are likel=
y
to
amplify in the lee of the Rockies and move off to the east and northeast.
Additionally, there is the potential for an enhancement of the subtropical =
jet
by the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) during the 6-10 day period, which ma=
y
influence precipitation across parts of the southwestern CONUS via enhanced
moisture advection. In the Southeast and along the Gulf and East coasts,
below-normal precipitation is favored under strong mean surface high pressu=
re.
Odds also tilt toward below-normal precipitation in southern New Mexico and
western Texas, as frontal boundaries associated with amplifying low pressur=
e
systems over the Plains are not expected to influence the region.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement offset slightly by some disagreement among the
temperature
tools in Alaska, and the precipitation tools in the Southern Plains.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 10 - 16 2021

The predicted circulation pattern during the Week-2 period depicts an eastw=
ard
progression of the long-wave pattern from the 6-10 day period, with negativ=
e
500-hPa height anomalies moving over the Central and Northern Plains. Mean
ridging over the eastern CONUS is forecast to de-amplify during the Week-2
period, but remain, favoring positive mid-level height anomalies from the
Southern Plains to the eastern Great Lakes, extending eastward to the East
Coast. Broad troughing forecast west of Alaska leads to below-normal 500-hP=
a
heights over the Mainland and the Panhandle. Above-normal mid-level heights
remain across the Aleutians, under the influence of the Northeast Pacific
ridge
to the south.

With falling heights heading into, and throughout, the Week-2 period across
Mainland Alaska, elevated probabilities of below-normal temperatures are
forecast across much of the state. Probabilities of below-normal temperatur=
es
diminish to near-normal in the Aleutians, underneath positive mid-level hei=
ght
anomalies. Amplified troughing over the western CONUS favors enhanced
probabilities of below-normal temperatures along the West Coast, extending
eastward across the Rockies and into the western Great Plains. Conversely,
amplified ridging and mean southerly flow across the eastern CONUS enhances
odds of above-normal temperatures from the eastern Great Plains to the East
Coast.

Strong onshore flow favors above-normal precipitation in Mainland Alaska an=
d
the eastern Aleutians. In the western CONUS, above-normal precipitation is
favored near the base of the amplified mean trough. There is the potential =
for
enhancement of precipitation along southern portions of the West Coast earl=
y
in
the period, associated with the MJO's enhancement of the subtropical jet.
Elevated above-normal precipitation probabilities extend across the Central
Rockies and become more enhanced over the Central Plains into the Great Lak=
es,
as energy exiting the Rockies has the potential to amplify and move eastwar=
d.
Across the portions of the Southeast, high pressure is favored to dominate,
despite the potential for transient frontal boundaries, leading to a tilt i=
n
the odds toward below-normal precipitation. In southwestern Texas and New
Mexico, below-normal precipitation is also favored, as frontal boundaries f=
rom
low pressure systems to the north are not expected to influence the region.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
increased disagreement among the precipitation tools across the western hal=
f
of
the CONUS and some model inconsistency regarding the strength of the mean
ridge
over the eastern CONUS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for

...Showers and thunderstorms are likely across the Southeast
through Wednesday morning, with isolated flooding possible...

...Gusty winds and frigid wind chills expected in the Northeast
tonight, along with snow in the Rockies and interior Northeast
through Wednesday...

...Warm up continues across Central U.S. while Northeast cools
down...

A low pressure system, currently in the Gulf of Mexico, will
produce rain and thunderstorms across much of the Southeast
through tomorrow morning before exiting into the Atlantic. Showers
may linger across southern Florida during the day tomorrow.
Between 1-2 inches of rain is expected for the region with
isolated amounts surpassing 3 inches possible over parts of
southern South Carolina. In the meantime, a system moving across
southern Ontario will generate snow for parts of Upstate New York
and Vermont. A general area of 3-6 inches of snow is expected with
locally higher amounts possible. There's an Elevated Area of Fire
Risk over parts of the Central Plains tonight as dry air moves
into the region. Much of the central and western U.S. will
experience above average temperatures on Wednesday with parts of
the Northern Plains seeing high temperatures peak between 20-30
degrees above average.

A new low pressure system is forecast to emerge over southern
California tomorrow. This system will produce light rain across
the Southwest on Wednesday and snow over the Central/Southern
Rockies on Thursday, before strengthening over the Southern Plains
on Thursday night. Snow totals over the Central/Southern Rockies
should be between 3-6 inches with some isolated areas seeing near
a foot. Rain and thunderstorms may spread out ahead of this system
over the Central/Southern Plains Thursday evening into Friday. A
complex system will arrive over the Pacific Northwest on Thursday
night. Another Elevated Fire Weather area is in effect for parts
of the Desert Southwest as winds and dry conditions increase on
Wednesday. The Northeast will cool down as the Northern Plains
remain well above average as far as high temperatures go on
Thursday.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Initially the upper level pattern over the CONUS is expected to be
characterized by troughing along both coasts with a compact
shortwave trough over the Southern Plains. That system is forecast
to quickly move toward the Southeast and become absorbed into the
developing longwave trough over the East Coast this weekend while
the West Coast energy traverses the Rockies and weakens as it
opens up into the Plains Sunday. Reinforcing shortwave troughing
will then settle over the West Coast early next week while
downstream ridging flattens out east of the Rockies. From a
sensible weather perspective, focus of precipitation will be along
the Southeast/Florida early in the period while the West Coast,
particularly the Pacific Northwest, remains unsettled to active.
Temperature anomalies will be noteworthy for the Northern Plains.

This cycle model guidance showed just average agreement through
day 5 with the progression of the shortwave energies from the
Plains to the Southeast and West Coast through the Rockies. The
GFS was considerably faster than the consensus (UKMET met was
equally as slow) and it showed a faster/flatter progression of
shortwave energy coming into the Plains by day 5. The 12Z run
showed a similar solution which is decidedly different from
consensus and the other ensemble means. Its inclusion in the WPC
blend was considerably less compared to the more favorable
ECMWF/CMC which showed a slightly more amplified idea. This
muddles the forecast for day 5-7 east of the Rockies where either
more ridging or a flatter quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Meanwhile,
for the West Coast, guidance shows fairly good agreement in
another shortwave trough settling along the coast by late this
weekend into next week. Overall, the WPC blend was initialized
with mostly a ECMWF heavy component with inclusion of the CMC and
GFS. By day 6-7, mostly ECMWF/ECENS was incorporated with some
inclusion of the GEFS.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Southern Plains upper low will weaken/fill as it becomes
absorbed into the longwave trough over the East Coast this
weekend. Its associated surface low, compact and quick moving,
will bring a period moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall to
portions of Florida, particularly portions of the northern/central
peninsula where the combination of daytime heating, available
moisture, and lift interact. This wave will then deepen as it
moves well offshore and cooler, Canadian high pressure builds
across the entire East Coast.

With troughing expected through most of the period across the
Pacific Northwest, expect generally unsettled weather with
frequent periods of precipitation. Overall, each individual system
could produce some moderate to locally heavy precipitation and the
cumulative effect over the period is for several inches of
precipitation mainly confined to the extreme coastal ares of
northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

Much above normal to near record warm temperatures are forecast
Friday, this weekend, and early next week for portions of the
Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Daytime highs in the 60s
(nearing 70F in South Dakota) will be 20-30F above normal for this
time of year. Nighttime lows may stay above freezing Saturday and
Sunday and this would be 10-20F above normal. Some records could
be broken for daytime highs and lows. These warm temperatures will
gradually spread toward the Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic early next week though will likely moderate some
(anomalies 10-15F). Below normal readings are forecast for the
West Coast late this weekend into next week.

particularly the Pacific Northwest, remains unsettled to active.
Temperature anomalies will be noteworthy for the Northern Plains.

This cycle model guidance showed just average agreement through
day 5 with the progression of the shortwave energies from the
Plains to the Southeast and West Coast through the Rockies. The
GFS was considerably faster than the consensus (UKMET met was
equally as slow) and it showed a faster/flatter progression of
shortwave energy coming into the Plains by day 5. The 12Z run
showed a similar solution which is decidedly different from
consensus and the other ensemble means. Its inclusion in the WPC
blend was considerably less compared to the more favorable
ECMWF/CMC which showed a slightly more amplified idea. This
muddles the forecast for day 5-7 east of the Rockies where either
more ridging or a flatter quasi-zonal flow takes shape. Meanwhile,
for the West Coast, guidance shows fairly good agreement in
another shortwave trough settling along the coast by late this
weekend into next week. Overall, the WPC blend was initialized
with mostly a ECMWF heavy component with inclusion of the CMC and
GFS. By day 6-7, mostly ECMWF/ECENS was incorporated with some
inclusion of the GEFS.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Southern Plains upper low will weaken/fill as it becomes
absorbed into the longwave trough over the East Coast this
weekend. Its associated surface low, compact and quick moving,
will bring a period moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall to
portions of Florida, particularly portions of the northern/central
peninsula where the combination of daytime heating, available
moisture, and lift interact. This wave will then deepen as it
moves well offshore and cooler, Canadian high pressure builds
across the entire East Coast.

With troughing expected through most of the period across the
Pacific Northwest, expect generally unsettled weather with
frequent periods of precipitation. Overall, each individual system
could produce some moderate to locally heavy precipitation and the
cumulative effect over the period is for several inches of
precipitation mainly confined to the extreme coastal ares of
northern California, Oregon, and Washington.

Much above normal to near record warm temperatures are forecast
Friday, this weekend, and early next week for portions of the
Northern Rockies and Northern Plains. Daytime highs in the 60s
(nearing 70F in South Dakota) will be 20-30F above normal for this
time of year. Nighttime lows may stay above freezing Saturday and
Sunday and this would be 10-20F above normal. Some records could
be broken for daytime highs and lows. These warm temperatures will
gradually spread toward the Great Lakes, Northeast, and
Mid-Atlantic early next week though will likely moderate some
(anomalies 10-15F). Below normal readings are forecast for the
West Coast late this weekend into next week.

Valid 12Z Sat Mar 06 2021 - 12Z Wed Mar 10 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Eastern Pacific mean troughing aloft will gradually expand
eastward over the course of the period, eventually including
portions of the western U.S.  Features within and ejecting from
this trough will focus multiple episodes of precipitation along
the West Coast with somewhat more moderate totals over the
Interior West and Rockies.  By next Tuesday-Wednesday one ejecting
shortwave may generate a significant Plains system along with a
broad precipitation area over the central into east-central U.S.
Meanwhile a shortwave entering the West to start the weekend will
become more diffuse as it traverses the lower 48 though a mean
ridge, temporarily flattening flow slightly which will help push
along an amplified upper trough over the East Coast during the
weekend.  Expect a mean ridge to reach the East by next Wednesday.

As for guidance details, the 12Z model consensus suddenly jumped
toward the somewhat faster GFS for the shortwave entering the West
by the start of the period early Saturday and the new 00Z runs are
holding fairly close to that idea.  The average of guidance is
still a little slower than the GFS but differences are trending
closer to the noise range.  Upstream there is reasonable
clustering for a deep-layer low to settle just off the Pacific
Northwest from about late weekend into the first half of next
week, with gradually increasing uncertainty for the eastward
extent of the low and details of a possible reinforcing feature
late in the period.  Recent GFS runs have been a bit on the
fast/strong side with shortwave energy ejecting into the West and
Plains early-mid week.  Based on recent operational model runs
there is still at least a moderate signal for what could be a
fairly strong system over the Northern Plains but with a fair
amount of variability/spread for specifics.  Overall an
operational model blend trending to a model/mean mix (including
some 18Z parallel GFS to tone down some operational run specifics
especially late in the period) represented consensus evolution
well.  This yielded a solution perhaps slightly on the
conservative side for the late period Plains system while awaiting
improved agreement/stability on specifics.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Systems carried within the mean trough aloft near the West Coast
will support an unsettled period with multiple episodes of rain
and higher elevation snow from the Pacific Northwest into northern
California and Sierra Nevada.  Precipitation could be moderate to
locally heavy at times with highest five-day totals (perhaps
reaching several inches) most likely over southwest Oregon into
northern California.  The Interior West and Rockies should also
see periods of precipitation though with less extreme totals.
Expect precipitation to expand across the Plains and east-central
U.S. with a potential Tuesday-Wednesday system, with rain and
thunderstorms in the warm sector and some wintry weather possible
over the extreme northern tier depending on how the system evolves.

Weakening Southern Plains upper low energy dropping toward the
Gulf Coast by early Saturday and then becoming absorbed into the
longwave East Coast trough will support fast moving Gulf of Mexico
into Atlantic low pressure.  Most associated rainfall should be
over the Florida Peninsula with moderate to perhaps locally heavy
rainfall possible over northern/central areas with the best
interaction of daytime heating, available moisture, and lift.
This wave will then deepen and move well offshore while cool high
pressure builds over the eastern U.S.

Much above normal temperatures over the Northern Plains this
weekend, reaching 10-25F above normal, will gradually extend
eastward into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes with less extreme
warmth also reaching into the Northeast by late in the period.
Some daily records for highs and/or warm lows will be possible.
By next Tuesday-Wednesday well above normal readings for morning
lows in particular will extend well southward over the Plains and
Mississippi Valley as Gulf inflow increases.  Elsewhere, a cooling
trend toward moderately below normal readings will spread across
the western U.S. during the period.  East Coast states will be
chilly during the weekend with highs 5-10F or so below normal and
then trend warmer.

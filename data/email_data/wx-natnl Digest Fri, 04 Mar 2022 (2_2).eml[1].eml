Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 AM EST Fri Mar 04 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 07 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 11 2022

...Heavy rain potential across the Ohio Valley into Monday...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Monday with broad troughing (with
embedded shortwaves) across the central U.S. pushing a cold front
into the East. This setup brings a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall across the Ohio Valley, with snow to the north.
Shortwaves should weaken in the flow as they progress downstream
as heights begin to rise over the East Coast. Out West, a strong
ridge over the east Pacific should allow for shortwaves to keep
reinforced troughing over the Rockies, which eventually should
press east into the Plains by late next week.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance continues to show good agreement in the
large scale pattern through much of the period, with mostly
typical timing and detail differences needing to be worked out.
Good consensus exists that a surface wave (or two) will develop
along the cold front over the Ohio Valley on Monday, progressing
into the Mid-Atlantic by Tuesday. There continues to be some
subtle timing differences with this low, which stems from
differences aloft in the shortwave. The CMC and UKMET are a hair
faster than the GFS/ECMWF and ensemble means, but a general blend
of the guidance does offer a good starting point on position.

Farther west, energy diving south along the West Coast on Monday
produces differences that become more notable Tuesday and beyond.
Before the new 00z runs this morning, the CMC appeared to be an
outlier with a slower/more amplified solution closing off a low
over the Southwest on Tuesday and the remainder of the guidance
more open/faster (to varying degrees). However, the new 00z
guidance arriving this morning from the GFS, the ECMWF, and the
UKMET has also trended towards the CMC with a closed low. The WPC
forecast for overnight leaned more on the faster side of the
envelope given the CMC seemed an outlier, but with the new 00z
runs (which were not available at forecast issuance), even the WPC
forecast may now be too fast mid week and beyond with the energy
as it moves into the central Plains. In other words, this remains
a very low confidence forecast.

The next shortwave arrives into the Pacific Northwest around
Wednesday-Thursday which should help to reinforce broad troughing
over the Rockies which eventually pushes into the Central U.S. by
the end of the week. There are some timing differences regarding
both the trough axis and the associated surface front. The 18z/Mar
3 GFS was faster than the ECMWF with the ensemble means also maybe
more in like with the slower ECMWF. The WPC forecast leaned
heavily on the ensemble means for this system given the late
period/low predictability with some inclusion of the deterministic
runs for a little added system definition.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Rain and thunderstorms will be widespread along and ahead of the
cold front moving through the Eastern U.S. early next week. The
axis of the heaviest rain by Monday is forecast from the lower
Ohio Valley into the central Appalachians and northern
Mid-Atlantic. Flooding and flash flooding are possible
particularly in areas that see repeat/training convection and in
areas where soils are already wet, and newly experimental Slight
Risks of excessive rainfall remain in place for day 4. A swath of
wintry precipitation could develop on the north side, with light
to moderate amounts possible from into the Great Lakes and
interior Northeast. Then by the middle of next week, Gulf moisture
could return to the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast, but
uncertainty remains with respect to rainfall totals, all dependent
on a stalling boundary and possible waves of low pressure.

The West should see a break in the precipitation on Monday, but
mountains snows return by Tuesday and beyond for the Pacific
Northwest and especially the Rockies. There remains some
potential, but low confidence, on snowfall into the northern
Plains/upper Midwest late week as low pressure tries to develop
over the central states.

Temperatures should feel very mild for the south-central to
eastern part of the U.S. on Monday ahead of the cold front, with
temperatures 10 to 30 degrees above average and dozens of daily
record high minimum and maximum temperatures possible.
Temperatures should moderate back to near normal after the frontal
passage on Tuesday. The West and parts of the central U.S. will
generally be cooler than average underneath persistent troughing
through much of the period. Although with more substantial
troughing into the region mid to late next week, temperatures
should trend cooler with anomalies 10 to 30 degrees below normal
possible across the northern and central Plains, and as far south
as Texas and Oklahoma.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO INTO PARTS OF
THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A shortwave trough currently nearing the southern California coast
will continue eastward through the Southwest today. With time, the
trough will accelerate northeastward into the central and southern
High Plains regions. At the surface, a lee cyclone in eastern
Colorado will during the day. A dryline will eventually sharpen
across the southern High Plains.

...Eastern New Mexico into southwest Kansas...
Mid-level winds will be on the increase through the day. The
mid-level jet will generally be well-timed with peak boundary-layer
mixing. Water vapor imagery early this morning shows mid-level
moisture moving across the region. It is likely that some cloud
cover will be present during the morning and early afternoon. Cloud
cover and a slow deepening surface cyclone may limit temporal
overlap of the strongest winds and lowest RH. Given the dryness of
fuels, large fire growth is possible even with limited duration of
RH near 15% and 20 mph winds.

...Western/Central New Mexico...
Areas to the West of the High Plains are expected to be impacted by
a region of mid-level subsidence. This should lead to greater
potential for dry and windy conditions. Winds of 20-30 mph are
possible along with 10-20% RH. Fuels are not as dry as areas to the
east, particularly within higher elevation. However, the strength of
winds and low RH should bring potential for larger fire growth.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR TEXAS PANHANDLE...NORTHWEST
OKLAHOMA...PARTS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN KANSAS...

...Synopsis...
A potent shortwave trough will be present over the southern High
Plains early Saturday morning. This trough will continue its
northeastward progress through the day. A surface cyclone will
continue to deepen in western and central Kansas before pivoting to
the northeast along with its parent trough. Strong winds at low and
mid levels will occur ahead of an advancing cold front moving
through Kansas into Oklahoma.

...Parts of central and eastern Kansas...
As the area of mid-level subsidence moves in by mid to late morning,
areas of cloud cover should begin to clear. Strong southwesterly
winds will develop underneath a strong low and mid-level jet. Wind
speeds of 20-25 mph are possible with up to 30 mph occurring
locally, particularly ahead of the cold front. RH ahead of the
boundary will generally fall to 15-25%. Locally extremely critical
fire weather is possible. Areas at greatest risk for these
conditions are from Wichita to Manhattan into parts of the Flint
Hills. However, the speed of the cold front and the limited spatial
extent of RH less than 15% precludes categorical upgrades. The
post-front environment, though with higher RH, will still be breezy
and produce an abrupt wind shift westerly/northwesterly.

...Southern Plains...
Areas of elevated to critical fire weather will extend from the
Trans-Pecos into the Texas Panhandle and western/central Oklahoma.
Winds of 15-20 mph will be common across these areas along with
15-20% RH. Critical conditions will be most likely in the Texas
Panhandle and northwest Oklahoma where a better coupling of the
low-level and mid-level jet will occur. Locally critical may extend
eastward in to parts of the I-35 corridor, however.

...Dynamic system to produce wintry weather and thunderstorms over
the Northern Plains and Midwest this weekend...

...Potential for record breaking warmth across parts of the East
on Sunday-Monday, with fire weather conditions worsening in the
Southwest and Southern/Central Plains this weekend...

...Cooler temperatures, lower elevation rain, and mountain snow
move into California, the Southwest, and Great Basin today...


A surface wave, currently moving across the Front Range, will
develop into a dynamic low pressure system this weekend. A warm
front associated with this low will continue to pump warm air into
the Great Plains and Southeast today before expanding into the
Midwest on Saturday and East on Sunday. A dryline will develop
within this warm airmass, extending down through the Southern
Plains. This paired with windy surface conditions will produce a
critical fire weather risk across parts of southern-eastern New
Mexico, the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle, southeast Colorado and much
of Kansas this weekend. As the low pressure system deepens on
Saturday, the threat for thunderstorm activity will increase over
portions of the Mississippi Valley and Midwest. Some areas,
particularly over Iowa and the rest of the Upper Midwest, may
experience severe weather in the form of supercells capable of
producing damaging winds, a few tornadoes and hail.

As the dynamic Front Range system strengthens over the next 48
hours it will generate a swath of light to moderate snowfall over
the Northern Plains to the Upper Midwest. There will be a chance
for accumulating freezing rain over parts of the Upper Midwest
extending from southern Minnesota through northern Wisconsin and
into the Upper Peninsula of Michigan this weekend. Some isolated
areas may see over a quarter of an inch of ice. Weekend travel
precautions are advised. High pressure on the backside of this
system will reintroduce frigid air into the Northern/Central
Plains on Saturday and Sunday, with highs likely to be between
20-30 degrees below average in many places. Troughing in the west
will produce moderate to heavy mountain snow for parts of the
Sierra, Great Basin and Central/Southern Rockies this weekend. Low
elevation rain is expected for these regions as well. The warm
airmass centered over the central part of the country today will
expand eastward this weekend before settling over the East on
Sunday and Monday. Record high and low temperatures may be tied or
broken as a result.

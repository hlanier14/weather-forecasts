NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1049 AM CST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. See the
previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 12/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1214 AM CST Sat Dec 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will progress across the East Coast as more zonal
flow aloft prevails over the central U.S. A 1036 mb surface high
across the central Rockies will encourage modest gradient-driven
surface westerly winds across the central and southern High Plains.
10-15 percent RH is expected to be common across southeast Colorado
into northeast New Mexico and the western Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles
by afternoon peak heating. Still, sustained surface wind speeds are
expected to remain below 15 mph on a widespread basis, with only
locally Elevated fire weather conditions expected along the southern
High Plains, hence no fire weather highlights introduced.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Dec 14 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 18 2021

...Another moisture surge is forecast to reach northern California
and Oregon midweek as heavy precipitation winds down in southern
California...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. toward the
snow-covered region of upper Midwest ahead of an intensifying
cyclone...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through most of
the medium range remains much better than normal, bolstering
forecast confidence. The WPC medium range forecast package was
based on 40% from the 06Z GFS and GEFS, 40% from the 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More weights from the
ensemble means were applied starting from Day 5.5.  This blend
yielded a solution quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast
package.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified upper trough will push onshore into the Southwest
next Tuesday into Wednesday.  Widespread terrain-enhanced rainfall
and heavy mountain snows over southern California on Tuesday will
likely wind down by Wednesday as the trough pushes inland and then
lift northeastward through the western U.S. midweek, bringing
widespread mountain snow/rain through the Great Basin and
northern/central Rockies.  As the main system lifts northeastward
through the Plains next Wed-Thu, the possibility of rapid
cyclogenesis across the northern U.S. will likely lead to an
expansive area of strong winds, together with a swath of wintry
precipitation through the north side of the low track across the
northern Plains and upper Midwest to upper Great Lakes.  Ahead of
the deep cyclone, an upper ridge will build over the central U.S.
where anomalous warmth will be most pronounced across the central
U.S.  In fact, record high temperatures upwards to 40F above
normal next Wednesday will likely spread toward a region of the
upper Midwest where significant amounts of snow just fell
recently.  Any rain that should fall on top of the snow together
with the record warmth could lead to flooding issues.

Behind the amplified upper trough, another moisture surge is
forecast to reach northern California and Oregon midweek as the
next Pacific cyclone approaches the West Coast.  Moderate to heavy
precipitation should continue across these areas through midweek.
It appears that moisture from the next Pacific system will impact
the Pacific Northwest on Friday and into the weekend.

On the East Coast, anomalous warmth ahead of a cold front will
reach the area late next week.  Meanwhile, the trailing portion of
the cold front will likely become nearly stationary across the
Deep South where an axis of enhanced rainfall is forecast to set
up across the southern Plains through the Tennessee Valley.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Dec 14 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 18 2021

...Another moisture surge is forecast to reach northern California
and Oregon midweek as heavy precipitation winds down in southern
California...

...Record warmth to spread from the central U.S. toward the
snow-covered region of upper Midwest ahead of an intensifying
cyclone...


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble forecast clustering and spread through most of
the medium range remains much better than normal, bolstering
forecast confidence. The WPC medium range forecast package was
based on 40% from the 06Z GFS and GEFS, 40% from the 00Z ECMWF/EC
mean, and 20% from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More weights from the
ensemble means were applied starting from Day 5.5.  This blend
yielded a solution quite compatible with the previous WPC forecast
package.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

An amplified upper trough will push onshore into the Southwest
next Tuesday into Wednesday.  Widespread terrain-enhanced rainfall
and heavy mountain snows over southern California on Tuesday will
likely wind down by Wednesday as the trough pushes inland and then
lift northeastward through the western U.S. midweek, bringing
widespread mountain snow/rain through the Great Basin and
northern/central Rockies.  As the main system lifts northeastward
through the Plains next Wed-Thu, the possibility of rapid
cyclogenesis across the northern U.S. will likely lead to an
expansive area of strong winds, together with a swath of wintry
precipitation through the north side of the low track across the
northern Plains and upper Midwest to upper Great Lakes.  Ahead of
the deep cyclone, an upper ridge will build over the central U.S.
where anomalous warmth will be most pronounced across the central
U.S.  In fact, record high temperatures upwards to 40F above
normal next Wednesday will likely spread toward a region of the
upper Midwest where significant amounts of snow just fell
recently.  Any rain that should fall on top of the snow together
with the record warmth could lead to flooding issues.

Behind the amplified upper trough, another moisture surge is
forecast to reach northern California and Oregon midweek as the
next Pacific cyclone approaches the West Coast.  Moderate to heavy
precipitation should continue across these areas through midweek.
It appears that moisture from the next Pacific system will impact
the Pacific Northwest on Friday and into the weekend.

On the East Coast, anomalous warmth ahead of a cold front will
reach the area late next week.  Meanwhile, the trailing portion of
the cold front will likely become nearly stationary across the
Deep South where an axis of enhanced rainfall is forecast to set
up across the southern Plains through the Tennessee Valley.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 PM CST Sat Dec 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Central OK into central KS...
Ahead of the advancing lee trough, southerly surface winds will
increase through the afternoon potentially reaching 15-20 mph at
times across central/eastern OK and KS. Warm temperatures and
marginally low surface humidity (around 20%) may support a few hours
of locally elevated to near fire weather conditions late in the
afternoon. Across the region, fuels remain supportive given the
anomalously warm and dry conditions. However, the lack of greater
winds and lower humidity should keep the threat mostly local in
nature.

To the west, the previous forecast remains valid with only minor
adjustments. The elevated area was extended eastward slightly to
account for deeper vertical mixing near the lee trough supporting
stronger winds and lower RH across western OK and Southwest KS.

..Lyons.. 12/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CST Sat Dec 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build across the southeast U.S. as a mid-level
trough deepens along the West Coast tomorrow afternoon. Surface lee
troughing across the central/southern High Plains will encourage
downslope dry and breezy conditions supporting a wildfire-spread
threat. The latest guidance consensus depicts widespread 10-20
percent RH coinciding with 25 mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds across the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles by afternoon peak
heating, warranting Critical highlights. At least locally Elevated
fire weather conditions are expected farther north and east into
central Kansas/Oklahoma. However, guidance varies widely in terms of
how low RH will drop across the central Plains, precluding an
eastward extension of the Elevated area this outlook. Given
widespread 15-25 mph south-southwesterly surface winds across
central Kansas/Oklahoma tomorrow afternoon, Elevated highlights may
be needed pending lower RH trends in future guidance.

Valid 00Z Sun Dec 12 2021 - 00Z Tue Dec 14 2021

...There is a Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms for parts of the
Southeast and Tennessee Valley tonight...

...There are Slight Risks of Excessive Rainfall for parts of the
central California Coast on Sunday and Monday...

...Heavy snow for the Cascades, Sierra and Northern Rockies;
Critical Fire Weather risk for the Texas Panhandle...

Severe thunderstorms in the East and heavy snow in the West will
be our main weather threats over the next couple of days. A
shortwave trough currently moving across the Midwest will continue
to fuel dangerous severe weather activity across much of the
eastern third of the country tonight. Widespread thunderstorm
activity is also likely to continue spawning along a cold front,
which is moving west to east through the Midwest and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Damaging wind gusts are likely to be the main
threat from these storms tonight across much of the Mid-Atlantic.
Travel precautions and general vigilance should be taken by those
who live in areas experiencing thunderstorms tonight due to
reduced visibility.

A deep upper-level trough will amplify and generate rich moisture
advection into the Northwest and down through California over the
next few days. Heavy coastal and low elevation rain is likely,
especially over parts of central California on Sunday and Monday.
Flash flooding will be a concern for these places, and
particularly for burn scar areas where debris buildup can pose a
threat to life and property. Heavy snow will fall over the
Cascades, Sierra and Northern Rockies tonight. Between 1-3 feet
can be expected for most of these mountain ranges with 3-4 feet
more likely over the highest peaks of the Sierra by Monday
evening. Winter Storm Watches, Warnings and Advisories are in
effect for these areas. Heavy rain will spread into central and
southern California by Monday night. Elsewhere, there's a Critical
Risk of localized Fire threats across much of the Texas panhandle
late Sunday afternoon due to warm temperatures, low humidity and
increased winds (15-20mph). Anomalous warmth returns to the
Central/Southern Plains on Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat December 11 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
152 AM EST Sun Dec 12 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 15 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 19 2021

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance clustering and forecast spread/predictability through
medium range remains much better than normal. The WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite of the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models Days 3-7. This blend yielded a solution quite compatible
with the previous WPC forecast package and seems well supported by
GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensembles. Latest 00 UTC guidance overall remains
consistent with this composite through much of the forecast
period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A vigorous upper trough will lift northeastward from the Southwest
midweek, bringing widespread mountain snow/rain through the Great
Basin and northern/central Rockies. As the system lifts through
the Plains Wed-Thu, rapid cyclogenesis across the north-central
U.S. will lead to an expansive area of strong winds, together with
a swath of wintry precipitation through the north side of the low
track across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest to the upper
Great Lakes. Ahead of the deep cyclone, an upper ridge will build
over the central U.S. where anomalous warmth will be most
pronounced midweek with record high temperatures upwards to 30-40F
above normal. Modest lead rains that should fall on top of recent
Upper Midwest snows together with the record warmth could lead to
flooding issues. Anomalous warmth ahead of the trailing cold
front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F, will reach the
East late week. The moderating front will stall across the Deep
South. An axis of enhanced rainfall is forecast to set up from the
southern Plains through the Mid-South and the OH Valley/Northeast
Fri/next weekend with emerging return flow and organized frontal
wave development and lift. A swath of weekend snow may also occur
on the cooled northwest periphery of this precipitation shield.

Upstream on the heels of the aforementioned lead storm, another
moisture surge and moderate to heavy precipitation is forecast to
reach northern California and Oregon Wed/Thu as the next Pacific
cyclone reaches the West Coast. Guidance signal is also growing
that moisture from yet another Pacific system will modestly impact
the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance clustering and forecast spread/predictability through
medium range remains much better than normal. The WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite of the 18 UTC
GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models Days 3-7. This blend yielded a solution quite compatible
with the previous WPC forecast package and seems well supported by
GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF ensembles. Latest 00 UTC guidance overall remains
consistent with this composite through much of the forecast
period.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A vigorous upper trough will lift northeastward from the Southwest
midweek, bringing widespread mountain snow/rain through the Great
Basin and northern/central Rockies. As the system lifts through
the Plains Wed-Thu, rapid cyclogenesis across the north-central
U.S. will lead to an expansive area of strong winds, together with
a swath of wintry precipitation through the north side of the low
track across the northern Plains and Upper Midwest to the upper
Great Lakes. Ahead of the deep cyclone, an upper ridge will build
over the central U.S. where anomalous warmth will be most
pronounced midweek with record high temperatures upwards to 30-40F
above normal. Modest lead rains that should fall on top of recent
Upper Midwest snows together with the record warmth could lead to
flooding issues. Anomalous warmth ahead of the trailing cold
front, with positive anomalies upwards to 15-25F, will reach the
East late week. The moderating front will stall across the Deep
South. An axis of enhanced rainfall is forecast to set up from the
southern Plains through the Mid-South and the OH Valley/Northeast
Fri/next weekend with emerging return flow and organized frontal
wave development and lift. A swath of weekend snow may also occur
on the cooled northwest periphery of this precipitation shield.

Upstream on the heels of the aforementioned lead storm, another
moisture surge and moderate to heavy precipitation is forecast to
reach northern California and Oregon Wed/Thu as the next Pacific
cyclone reaches the West Coast. Guidance signal is also growing
that moisture from yet another Pacific system will modestly impact
the Pacific Northwest next weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLES...

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will build across the south-central U.S. as a
mid-level trough amplifies while impinging on the interior West. At
the surface, lee troughing will commence across the High Plains this
afternoon, with a surface low becoming established in the vicinity
of the Colorado Front Range. Downslope flow along the lee of the
Rockies and dry southwesterly gradient winds will foster
wildfire-spread conditions across portions of the southern High
Plains toward the central Plains through the afternoon/evening
hours.

Guidance consensus continues to show 20-25 mph sustained
southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 10-20 percent RH by
afternoon peak heating across the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles,
where fuels are receptive to fire spread and Critical highlights
remain in place. Farther northeast into central Kansas/Oklahoma, RH
will drop to 20 percent in several locales, with sustained southerly
winds peaking in the 15-20 mph range, warranting the maintenance of
Elevated highlights. The Elevated area has also been expanded
northwestward into eastern Colorado. Here, surface winds may be
weaker compared to points farther south and east. However, RH is
expected to drop into the 10-15 percent range for several hours,
atop fuels that are critically receptive to fire spread,
compensating for the lack of a stronger surface wind field.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0151 AM CST Sun Dec 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging will persist across the Southeast as a slowly
eastward-moving upper trough continues to deepen across the western
CONUS tomorrow/Monday. Surface lee troughing will remain in place
across the High Plains, promoting dry and breezy conditions that are
at least modestly conducive to wildfire spread. Elevated highlights
have been introduced where 15+ mph sustained southwesterly surface
winds are most likely to overlap with 15-20 percent RH, and where
fuels are receptive to fire spread. While the more favorable
overlapping winds/RH are expected to be more localized across
southeast Colorado, Elevated highlights have been included along the
Front Range given the presence of critically dry fuels.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Central California through Monday morning; The Slight Risk expands
into parts of Southern California on Monday into Tuesday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and
Northern Rockies...

...Critical Fire Weather risk for parts of the Southern High
Plains...

Multiple areas of upper-level energy will move over the West
Coast, with a developing upper-level low beginning to move onshore
over the Pacific Northwest overnight Monday into Tuesday. Along
with the upper-level energy, a plume of moisture will move
southward along the California Coast to Southern California by
Tuesday.  The moisture will produce coastal rain and higher
elevation snow over the Pacific Northwest and Northern California
and snow extending eastward to the Northern Rockies on Sunday
morning.  The rain and snow will expand into Central California on
Sunday evening. The rain will be heavy at times. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Central California through Monday morning. The associated heavy
rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with
urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

On Monday, the rain and higher elevation snow will steadily move
southward into parts of Southern California.  Likewise, the rain
will be heavy at times over the California Coast. Similarly, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Central into parts of Southern California from Monday into Tuesday
morning. Correspondingly, the associated heavy rain will create
mainly localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads,
and small streams the most vulnerable.

In addition, the heavy snow will be a long-duration event over the
Cascades, Sierra Nevada Mountains, and Northern Rockies. The snow
will result in reduced visibility and hazardous driving
conditions. Furthermore, as the upper-level low begins to move
onshore, the snow levels will drop down to sea level over parts of
the Pacific Northwest and down to the surface over parts of
Northern California overnight Monday into Tuesday morning.

High pressure will build in over the Mid-Atlantic on Sunday into
Tuesday.  On the west side of the high, warm temperatures will
encompass the Southern High Plains along with gusty wind.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Critical Risk Fire Weather threat
across much of the Texas panhandle Sunday into Monday due to warm
temperatures, low humidity, and increased wind (15-20mph).

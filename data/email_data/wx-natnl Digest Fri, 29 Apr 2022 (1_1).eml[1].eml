Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1143 AM CDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Expanded the critical area westward into southern Nevada based on
12Z guidance. Additionally, fuels are starting to dry out across
southern Utah and Colorado. Therefore, since critical meteorological
conditions are expected across this region, the elevated delineation
was expanded northward to cover this region, even with borderline
dry fuels.

Otherwise, only minor modifications were made in other areas.

..Bentley.. 04/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Thu Apr 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough accompanied by enhanced west-southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Intermountain West and impinge on the
central and southern Rockies. Meanwhile, a lee surface low will
deepen over eastern CO, with a dryline extending southward over the
southern High Plains. Farther east, strong northwesterly flow on the
backside of an occluded mid/upper-level low will persist over the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where a dry post-frontal airmass
will remain in place.

...Southwest into the Southern High Plains...
As the enhanced west-southwesterly flow overspreads a dry antecedent
airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains, diurnal
heating/mixing will result in widespread 5-15 percent RH behind the
dryline. Sustained west-southwesterly surface winds near 20-25 mph
will develop amid the critically low RH during the afternoon. The
best overlap of the strong surface winds and dry boundary-layer
conditions is expected across portions of east-central AZ, NM, and
far west TX -- where Critical highlights have been maintained.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Breezy northwesterly surface winds near 15 mph are expected amid
20-25 percent RH by peak heating. With continued drying of fine
fuels across the region, elevated fire-weather conditions can be
expected over parts of eastern PA, NJ, and far southeastern NY.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 28 2022

SYNOPSIS: At the beginning of the period, there is better consensus among
model
ensemble means in regards to the mid-level pattern, with mid-level low
pressure
predicted over the northeastern Lower 48 and the northern Pacific extending
into the Pacific Northwest. This pattern supports increased likelihood of much
below normal temperatures across parts of Midwest, Northeast, and Appalachians
at the beginning of week-2. As mid-level low pressure over the North Pacific
shifts eastward to the interior West, parts of the West could experience much
below normal temperatures toward the middle of the period. Surface low
formation favored over the Great Plains increases the risk for heavy
precipitation across portions of the Lower and Middle Mississippi, Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and Southeast during the first
few days of the period. Over Alaska, near normal temperatures are predicted
throughout much of the Mainland. Even with more seasonable temperatures
favored, above freezing daytime temperatures are still anticipated during
week-2, which may lead to localized flooding during the ice river breakup and
snowmelt season across the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Midwest,
Northeast, and Appalachians, and Mid-Atlantic, Fri-Sun, May 6-8.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across portions of the western
third of the CONUS, Mon-Tue, May 9-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Lower and Middle
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast, Fri-Sun, May 6-8.

Slight risk of much above normal temperatures across parts of Texas and
southwestern New Mexico, Sat-Tue, May 7-10.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Great Plains and Rockies,
Fri-Sun, May 6-8.

Possible flooding along the Red River of the North.

Possible flooding for the eastern and southern Alaska Interior Mainland.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SUNDAY MAY 01 - THURSDAY MAY 05:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!6lFvA_TmtNV16_T3GaXAUIpx32mPfZIhE6TIi-iONWVlJTb-uaSHS1HnqsCZkTF4a2JJeqqwqKtoRuOP1MmvaziGQps$

FOR FRIDAY MAY 06 - THURSDAY MAY 12: There is increased agreement among the 0Z
GEFS and 0Z ECMWF ensemble forecasts of the mid-level height pattern over the
CONUS at the beginning of the period compared to yesterday's guidance. Both
these models indicate mid-level troughing over the northeastern CONUS at the
beginning of the period, which is reflected in both the GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools supporting a slight risk of much below normal temperatures
across parts of of the Midwest, Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Appalachians, May
6 to 8. These tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 40 Deg F across the highlighted risk
area, gradually shifting eastward during the 8 to 10 day period.



Increased model agreement is also seen across the mid-level pattern across the
West, with mid-level toughing shifting from the northeastern Pacific and
Pacific Northwest eastward to the western half of the CONUS by day 11 (May 9).
Due to increased model agreement in the mid-level pattern and reforecast
tools,
a slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
western third of the CONUS, May 9 to 10. The reforecast tools indicate at
least
a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and
40 Deg F across the designated risk area. This risk diminishes toward the end
of the period as the trough aloft weakens.



For precipitation, a surface low and accompanying frontal system remains
favored over the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley which could bring
enhanced, and possibly locally heavy precipitation across the Lower and Middle
Mississippi, Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and
Southeast early in the period. The ECMWF and Canadian continue to be more
bullish than the GEFS with this heavy precipitation potential in the
uncalibrated ensemble guidance, and the ECMWF reforecast tool continues to
depict increased chances (>20%) for 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the
85th percentile and 1 inch, with increased signals further south across in the
Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys compared to yesterday. The GEFS
reforecast tool does continue to show at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall
totals exceeding one inch, however increased probabilities exceeding the 85th
percentile are  limited to the Lower Mississippi Valley. Despite these
differences, there remains good run-to-run continuity in the ECMWF and
Canadian
ensembles and ECMWF calibrated and uncalibrated guidance, to support the
continuation of a slight risk of heavy precipitation. for May 6 to 8. This
slight risk area is shifted farther south in accordance with the latest
guidance relative to yesterday's outlook.



Across the southern tier of the CONUS, the reforecast tools continue to show
at
least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and
95
degrees F, predominantly over Texas associated with mid-level ridging across
the South-Central CONUS. Due to continued agreement in the reforecast tools
and
better support  in the uncalibrated model guidance, a slight risk of much
above
normal temperature is posted for Texas and southwestern New Mexico, May 7 to
10, when the anomalous warm signals are greatest. Although these expected
temperatures may not be as impactful to human health, the unseasonably hot
conditions combined with anticipated below-normal precipitation favored during
week-2 over the Central and Southern Plains is likely to worsen drought
conditions and enhance wildfire risk throughout the region.



Surface low formation continues to be forecast in the ensemble and
deterministic guidance over the Great Plains at the beginning of week-2. The
ECMWF reforecast tool continues to show at least a 20% chance of wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph through the middle of the period, with
this high wind signal extending further south to the Southern Plains compared
to yesterday's outlook. Thus, a broad slight risk area of high winds is issued
across the Great Plains and neighboring Rockies for May 6 to 8. The enhanced
winds combined with aforementioned anomalous warmth and dry conditions could
increase wildfire risk.



A flooding possible hazard is also posted for many areas surrounding the Red
River of the North where there is ongoing snow melt and flooding. With
above-average precipitation favored during week-1, any additional
precipitation
during the period may worsen already saturated ground conditions over the
region.



Over Alaska, models continue to generally indicate mid-level troughing over
the
Gulf of Alaska. Today's mean week-2 outlook favors near normal temperatures.
Despite above normal temperatures no longer predicted for the period,
temperatures are still anticipated to support snowmelt. The possible flood
risk
area is modified to be focused over the eastern and southern Interior of
Alaska, which have near record snowpack and have the greatest concerns for
flooding.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 01 2022 - 12Z Thu May 05 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance for the Sunday-Thursday period maintains the theme
of an active pattern with a series of Pacific systems (each
supported by an upper trough that may contain a closed low for a
period of time) entering and progressing across the lower 48.
These systems will spread rain and high elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and northern half of the Rockies, and then
mostly rain over a large part of the central/eastern U.S. Some
areas of precipitation may be heavy.  This pattern will likely
leave the southern half or third of the West, the northern Plains
near the Canadian border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively
drier areas during the forecast period.  As for individual
features, a leading system will weaken as it tracks northeast from
the Upper Mississippi Valley Sunday onward while another over the
West by early Sunday should reach the Midwest/Great Lakes by
Tuesday and the next one entering the West by Monday may reach as
far east as the Mississippi Valley by next Thursday.  A larger
scale upper trough approaching the West Coast next Thursday may
also bring some moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means still key on the same individual systems
but continue to exhibit a combination of meaningful spread and/or
run-to-run variability/trending.  Some of the difficulty in the
forecast is that specifics will depend on not only the details of
each system as it tracks over the lower 48 but also the character
of central into eastern Canada mean troughing whose southern
periphery may interact with at least the leading two features.

The system forecast to be over the Upper Mississippi Valley as of
early Sunday is still well clustered at that time but then
uncertainties of southern Canada flow quickly come into play as it
lifts through and away from the Great Lakes.  By Tuesday the most
notable trend is over the Northeast where a more persistent
surface ridge leads to earlier dissipation of the front
approaching from the west on Monday.

For the next system that reaches the West just before the start of
the period early Sunday, there has been decent clustering and
continuity through about late Monday when the system reaches the
Plains.  From there guidance shows increasing divergence and some
trending for how flow aloft near the U.S.-Canadian border may
influence the system.  In general the trend over the past day is
for greater interaction which leads to a stronger surface low with
farther northwest track.  If anything, new 12Z guidance has
increased the spread as the UKMET has become an amplified extreme
with northern stream flow (yielding a deep/northern surface low)
while the CMC shows little stream interaction (to produce a weaker
and slower surface low).

Through the 00Z/06Z cycles, not much has changed for the forecast
of the third system which should reach the West on Monday.  The
00Z ECMWF remains a southern extreme with the upper low tracking
into the West and remains on the southwestern side of the envelope
for the rest of the period.  With time the GFS maintains its
position in the faster part of the spread.  GEFS mean runs have
tended to be similar to or somewhat slower than the operational
GFS while the UKMET/CMC have generally been between the two
extremes--though the new 12Z CMC is about as slow as the 00Z ECMWF
by day 7 Thursday.  Prefer to maintain an intermediate solution
while awaiting better convergence among the guidance.

Most models and means have been fairly well behaved thus far for
the upper trough nearing the West Coast next Thursday. GFS runs
have been more inconsistent, occasionally pulling more energy off
the southern periphery of the trough (most pronounced in the 00Z
run).

The updated forecast started with a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models for about the first half of the period and then
incorporated varying weights of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along
with some input from the models and WPC continuity.  This approach
maintained a solution close to continuity where guidance was
consistent or significant spread persists, while representing some
trends where sufficiently agreeable.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the Northwest and northern Rockies, one system should be
producing rain/mountain snow over the Rockies on Sunday while
another system right behind it will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies during Sunday into Tuesday.
Depending on exact system details, the second one could produce
some enhanced totals over or near the northern Rockies.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast by Thursday may start to bring
light precipitation into the Pacific Northwest at that time.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the leading surface low tracking
out of the Upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday and associated
fronts will spread precipitation across much of the eastern U.S.
with generally light to moderate rain.  Potential exists for
pockets of locally heavier activity though.  The trailing cold
front will stall over the southern Plains while the next system
emerges from the West, with this system currently expected to
track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.  Currently there
appears to be decent potential for some areas of moderate to heavy
rainfall from portions of the central/southern Plains
northeastward, but it will take additional time to refine more
precise threat areas within this area.  Some severe weather is
also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains Sunday and Monday.  The next system in the series
may produce yet another area of significant rainfall over and east
of the north-central through southern Plains.  Even more with this
system, confidence is fairly low for details of coverage and
timing.  A system on the deepest side of the spread could produce
some snow in the northern periphery, but this has fairly low
probability at the moment.  Some areas over the central U.S. need
to monitor forecasts of these systems given the potential to
produce significant weather and sensitivity to additional
rainfall.  At least for the time being, the majority of forecasts
produce most precipitation to the south of the far northern Plains
where soil conditions are the wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Upper Midwest will see the
most persistent below normal temperatures during the period.  Some
areas within this region may see highs at least 15-20F below
normal on Sunday-Monday and then remain 10-15F below normal
Tuesday through Thursday.  System progression over the West will
bring variable readings across the region late weekend into early
next week.  A ridge moving into and over the West will bring a
broader area of plus 5-15F anomalies for highs next
Wednesday-Thursday.  The East will tend to see above normal
temperatures, with morning lows tending to have more coverage of
plus 10F or greater anomalies than daytime highs.  Some locations
in the Northeast could see slightly below normal temperatures
early in the week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu April 28 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 04 - 08 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An amplified longwave trough and associated below normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over Alaska and the northeastern Pacific. A
ridge
associated with above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast at the higher
latitudes of central North America. A  trough is forecast to be situated over
the eastern CONUS.

Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of below
normal temperatures over the northeastern CONUS, Great Lakes, and Corn Belt.
Probabilities for below normal temperatures are elevated for the Pacific
Northwest as a shortwave trough is expected to cross this area. Conversely,
near to above normal temperatures are more likely for the remainder of the
CONUS due to above normal heights. The highest  forecast confidence in the 6-
10
day temperature outlook exists across the Southeast and along the Gulf Coast
due to anomalous warmth in response to the strengthening ridge aloft. Below
normal 500-hPa heights along with periods of  precipitation also favors below
normal temperatures for southern coastal Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

Enhanced onshore flow increases probabilities for above normal precipitation
across the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies. A predicted trough over the
eastern CONUS favors above normal precipitation over most of the central and
eastern CONUS, except for parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Great
Lakes
region where below normal precipitation is more likely. Below normal
precipitation is also favored over parts of the southwestern CONUS, supported
by most of the dynamical tools. Anomalous troughing and enhanced onshore flow
elevate probabilities for above normal precipitation throughout the eastern
half of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 06 - 12 2022

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means remain in good agreement, depicting a 500-hPa
trough and below normal 500-hPa heights extending from Alaska southward to the
northwestern coast of the CONUS. A ridge with above normal 500-hPa height is
forecast at the higher latitudes of central North America, while an amplifying
trough is predicted over the eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored for the Middle to Upper Mississippi
Valley, Corn Belt, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast, associated with predicted
troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights over the eastern CONUS. Enhanced
onshore flow coupled with below normal 500-hPa heights increase probabilities
for below normal temperatures across the northwestern CONUS. Above normal
500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of near to above normal temperatures
for the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with the consolidation temperature
tool. Below normal 500-hPa heights along with periods of precipitation also
favors below normal temperatures for southern coastal Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle in week-2.

As an amplified trough enters the western CONUS later in week-2, above normal
precipitation is favored from the Pacific Northwest eastward to the northern
Rockies and northern Plains. Early in week-2, a low pressure system and
trailing cold front favor above normal precipitation for parts of the
southeastern CONUS. Below normal precipitation is more likely for parts of the
Great Lakes region, due to a southward shift of a cold front. Near to below
normal precipitation is favored across the southwestern CONUS, supported by
most of the dynamical forecast tools. The 500-hPa height pattern over the
northern Pacific and Alaska remains the most stable feature throughout the
forecast domain. Given the likely continuation of a trough and onshore flow,
above normal precipitation remains slightly favored for eastern Mainland
Alaska
and the Alaska Panhandle.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the precipitation tools offset by differences in the
temperature tools for parts of the CONUS.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

Extended Forecast Discussion

300 PM EDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 01 2022 - 12Z Thu May 05 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance for the Sunday-Thursday period maintains the theme
of an active pattern with a series of Pacific systems (each
supported by an upper trough that may contain a closed low for a
period of time) entering and progressing across the lower 48.
These systems will spread rain and high elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and northern half of the Rockies, and then
mostly rain over a large part of the central/eastern U.S. Some
areas of precipitation may be heavy.  This pattern will likely
leave the southern half or third of the West, the northern Plains
near the Canadian border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively
drier areas during the forecast period.  As for individual
features, a leading system will weaken as it tracks northeast from
the Upper Mississippi Valley Sunday onward while another over the
West by early Sunday should reach the Midwest/Great Lakes by
Tuesday and the next one entering the West by Monday may reach as
far east as the Mississippi Valley by next Thursday.  A larger
scale upper trough approaching the West Coast next Thursday may
also bring some moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means still key on the same individual systems
but continue to exhibit a combination of meaningful spread and/or
run-to-run variability/trending.  Some of the difficulty in the
forecast is that specifics will depend on not only the details of
each system as it tracks over the lower 48 but also the character
of central into eastern Canada mean troughing whose southern
periphery may interact with at least the leading two features.

The system forecast to be over the Upper Mississippi Valley as of
early Sunday is still well clustered at that time but then
uncertainties of southern Canada flow quickly come into play as it
lifts through and away from the Great Lakes.  By Tuesday the most
notable trend is over the Northeast where a more persistent
surface ridge leads to earlier dissipation of the front
approaching from the west on Monday.

For the next system that reaches the West just before the start of
the period early Sunday, there has been decent clustering and
continuity through about late Monday when the system reaches the
Plains.  From there guidance shows increasing divergence and some
trending for how flow aloft near the U.S.-Canadian border may
influence the system.  In general the trend over the past day is
for greater interaction which leads to a stronger surface low with
farther northwest track.  If anything, new 12Z guidance has
increased the spread as the UKMET has become an amplified extreme
with northern stream flow (yielding a deep/northern surface low)
while the CMC shows little stream interaction (to produce a weaker
and slower surface low).

Through the 00Z/06Z cycles, not much has changed for the forecast
of the third system which should reach the West on Monday.  The
00Z ECMWF remains a southern extreme with the upper low tracking
into the West and remains on the southwestern side of the envelope
for the rest of the period.  With time the GFS maintains its
position in the faster part of the spread.  GEFS mean runs have
tended to be similar to or somewhat slower than the operational
GFS while the UKMET/CMC have generally been between the two
extremes--though the new 12Z CMC is about as slow as the 00Z ECMWF
by day 7 Thursday.  Prefer to maintain an intermediate solution
while awaiting better convergence among the guidance.

Most models and means have been fairly well behaved thus far for
the upper trough nearing the West Coast next Thursday. GFS runs
have been more inconsistent, occasionally pulling more energy off
the southern periphery of the trough (most pronounced in the 00Z
run).

The updated forecast started with a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models for about the first half of the period and then
incorporated varying weights of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along
with some input from the models and WPC continuity.  This approach
maintained a solution close to continuity where guidance was
consistent or significant spread persists, while representing some
trends where sufficiently agreeable.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the Northwest and northern Rockies, one system should be
producing rain/mountain snow over the Rockies on Sunday while
another system right behind it will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies during Sunday into Tuesday.
Depending on exact system details, the second one could produce
some enhanced totals over or near the northern Rockies.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast by Thursday may start to bring
light precipitation into the Pacific Northwest at that time.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the leading surface low tracking
out of the Upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday and associated
fronts will spread precipitation across much of the eastern U.S.
with generally light to moderate rain.  Potential exists for
pockets of locally heavier activity though.  The trailing cold
front will stall over the southern Plains while the next system
emerges from the West, with this system currently expected to
track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.  Currently there
appears to be decent potential for some areas of moderate to heavy
rainfall from portions of the central/southern Plains
northeastward, but it will take additional time to refine more
precise threat areas within this area.  Some severe weather is
also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains Sunday and Monday.  The next system in the series
may produce yet another area of significant rainfall over and east
of the north-central through southern Plains.  Even more with this
system, confidence is fairly low for details of coverage and
timing.  A system on the deepest side of the spread could produce
some snow in the northern periphery, but this has fairly low
probability at the moment.  Some areas over the central U.S. need
to monitor forecasts of these systems given the potential to
produce significant weather and sensitivity to additional
rainfall.  At least for the time being, the majority of forecasts
produce most precipitation to the south of the far northern Plains
where soil conditions are the wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Upper Midwest will see the
most persistent below normal temperatures during the period.  Some
areas within this region may see highs at least 15-20F below
normal on Sunday-Monday and then remain 10-15F below normal
Tuesday through Thursday.  System progression over the West will
bring variable readings across the region late weekend into early
next week.  A ridge moving into and over the West will bring a
broader area of plus 5-15F anomalies for highs next
Wednesday-Thursday.  The East will tend to see above normal
temperatures, with morning lows tending to have more coverage of
plus 10F or greater anomalies than daytime highs.  Some locations
in the Northeast could see slightly below normal temperatures
early in the week.

...Synopsis...
***OUTBREAK OF DANGEROUS FIRE-WEATHER CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER
SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO ON FRIDAY***

On the backside of an eastward-advancing western CONUS trough, an
intense west-northwesterly midlevel speed maximum will overspread
the central/southern Rockies and adjacent High Plains during peak
heating. In response, a lee surface low over western KS will rapidly
deepen, while a southward-extending dryline sharpens over the
southern High Plains. By the evening hours, the large-scale trough
and attendant surface cyclone will lift northeastward across the
central Plains, while a cold front sweeps southward across the
central and southern High Plains. This large-scale pattern will
yield extremely critical fire-weather conditions over southeastern
CO, and high-end critical conditions over parts of the Southwest and
much of the southern High Plains.

Farther east, strong/deep northwesterly flow will continue to
overspread the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic on the backside of an
occluded mid/upper-level low. In the low-levels, a relatively
warm/dry post-frontal airmass will remain in place -- where fine
fuels continue to dry.

...Southeastern Colorado...
As temperatures climb into the upper 70s by early afternoon, strong
downslope warming/drying of a dry antecedent airmass will result in
5-10 percent minimum RH. Under mostly clear skies, the diurnally
deepening boundary layer will extend into the very strong
west-northwesterly flow aloft, while the surface pressure gradient
rapidly tightens behind the sharpening dryline. A multi-model
consensus suggests that these factors will favor sustained
west-northwesterly surface winds of 30-40 mph with gusts upwards of
55 mph. This volatile combination of strong/gusty surface winds and
anomalously low RH atop critically dry fuels will foster extreme
fire-weather behavior during the afternoon hours. Therefore, upon
collaboration with WFO PUB, Extremely Critical highlights have been
added for southeastern CO. By the late evening hours, a cold front
will sweep southward across the area, with a northwesterly wind
shift and breezy conditions persisting in its wake.

...Parts of the Southwest and much of the southern High Plains...
Behind the dryline, deep boundary-layer mixing will result in
widespread minimum RH of 5-15 percent by the early afternoon. At the
same time, sustained westerly surface winds of 20-30 mph will
develop as the pressure gradient tightens. This will result in an
expansive area of high-end critical conditions across parts of the
Southwest and much of the southern High Plains. The eastern extent
of critical conditions will be demarcated by the sharpening dryline.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Efficient diurnal heating of the dry post-frontal airmass will allow
for 20-25 percent minimum RH, where fine fuels continue to dry
across the region. The dry boundary-layer conditions coupled with
sustained northwesterly surface winds near 15 mph will lead to
elevated fire-weather conditions during the afternoon hours.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
344 PM EDT Thu Apr 28 2022

Valid 12Z Sun May 01 2022 - 12Z Thu May 05 2022

...Overview...

Latest guidance for the Sunday-Thursday period maintains the theme
of an active pattern with a series of Pacific systems (each
supported by an upper trough that may contain a closed low for a
period of time) entering and progressing across the lower 48.
These systems will spread rain and high elevation snow across the
Pacific Northwest and northern half of the Rockies, and then
mostly rain over a large part of the central/eastern U.S. Some
areas of precipitation may be heavy.  This pattern will likely
leave the southern half or third of the West, the northern Plains
near the Canadian border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively
drier areas during the forecast period.  As for individual
features, a leading system will weaken as it tracks northeast from
the Upper Mississippi Valley Sunday onward while another over the
West by early Sunday should reach the Midwest/Great Lakes by
Tuesday and the next one entering the West by Monday may reach as
far east as the Mississippi Valley by next Thursday.  A larger
scale upper trough approaching the West Coast next Thursday may
also bring some moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means still key on the same individual systems
but continue to exhibit a combination of meaningful spread and/or
run-to-run variability/trending.  Some of the difficulty in the
forecast is that specifics will depend on not only the details of
each system as it tracks over the lower 48 but also the character
of central into eastern Canada mean troughing whose southern
periphery may interact with at least the leading two features.

The system forecast to be over the Upper Mississippi Valley as of
early Sunday is still well clustered at that time but then
uncertainties of southern Canada flow quickly come into play as it
lifts through and away from the Great Lakes.  By Tuesday the most
notable trend is over the Northeast where a more persistent
surface ridge leads to earlier dissipation of the front
approaching from the west on Monday.

For the next system that reaches the West just before the start of
the period early Sunday, there has been decent clustering and
continuity through about late Monday when the system reaches the
Plains.  From there guidance shows increasing divergence and some
trending for how flow aloft near the U.S.-Canadian border may
influence the system.  In general the trend over the past day is
for greater interaction which leads to a stronger surface low with
farther northwest track.  If anything, new 12Z guidance has
increased the spread as the UKMET has become an amplified extreme
with northern stream flow (yielding a deep/northern surface low)
while the CMC shows little stream interaction (to produce a weaker
and slower surface low).

Through the 00Z/06Z cycles, not much has changed for the forecast
of the third system which should reach the West on Monday.  The
00Z ECMWF remains a southern extreme with the upper low tracking
into the West and remains on the southwestern side of the envelope
for the rest of the period.  With time the GFS maintains its
position in the faster part of the spread.  GEFS mean runs have
tended to be similar to or somewhat slower than the operational
GFS while the UKMET/CMC have generally been between the two
extremes--though the new 12Z CMC is about as slow as the 00Z ECMWF
by day 7 Thursday.  Prefer to maintain an intermediate solution
while awaiting better convergence among the guidance.

Most models and means have been fairly well behaved thus far for
the upper trough nearing the West Coast next Thursday. GFS runs
have been more inconsistent, occasionally pulling more energy off
the southern periphery of the trough (most pronounced in the 00Z
run).

The updated forecast started with a composite of 00Z/06Z
operational models for about the first half of the period and then
incorporated varying weights of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along
with some input from the models and WPC continuity.  This approach
maintained a solution close to continuity where guidance was
consistent or significant spread persists, while representing some
trends where sufficiently agreeable.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the Northwest and northern Rockies, one system should be
producing rain/mountain snow over the Rockies on Sunday while
another system right behind it will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies during Sunday into Tuesday.
Depending on exact system details, the second one could produce
some enhanced totals over or near the northern Rockies.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast by Thursday may start to bring
light precipitation into the Pacific Northwest at that time.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the leading surface low tracking
out of the Upper Mississippi Valley on Sunday and associated
fronts will spread precipitation across much of the eastern U.S.
with generally light to moderate rain.  Potential exists for
pockets of locally heavier activity though.  The trailing cold
front will stall over the southern Plains while the next system
emerges from the West, with this system currently expected to
track through the Plains/Midwest early next week.  Currently there
appears to be decent potential for some areas of moderate to heavy
rainfall from portions of the central/southern Plains
northeastward, but it will take additional time to refine more
precise threat areas within this area.  Some severe weather is
also possible, with the Storm Prediction Center currently
indicating the best potential for severe thunderstorms across the
southern Plains Sunday and Monday.  The next system in the series
may produce yet another area of significant rainfall over and east
of the north-central through southern Plains.  Even more with this
system, confidence is fairly low for details of coverage and
timing.  A system on the deepest side of the spread could produce
some snow in the northern periphery, but this has fairly low
probability at the moment.  Some areas over the central U.S. need
to monitor forecasts of these systems given the potential to
produce significant weather and sensitivity to additional
rainfall.  At least for the time being, the majority of forecasts
produce most precipitation to the south of the far northern Plains
where soil conditions are the wettest.

The northern half of the Plains and Upper Midwest will see the
most persistent below normal temperatures during the period.  Some
areas within this region may see highs at least 15-20F below
normal on Sunday-Monday and then remain 10-15F below normal
Tuesday through Thursday.  System progression over the West will
bring variable readings across the region late weekend into early
next week.  A ridge moving into and over the West will bring a
broader area of plus 5-15F anomalies for highs next
Wednesday-Thursday.  The East will tend to see above normal
temperatures, with morning lows tending to have more coverage of
plus 10F or greater anomalies than daytime highs.  Some locations
in the Northeast could see slightly below normal temperatures
early in the week.

...Developing storm system over the central U.S. on Friday to
generate areas heavy snow across the northern Rockies, heavy rain
over the northern Plains, and severe thunderstorms in the
central/southern Plains...

...Critical to extreme fire weather located throughout parts of
the Southwest, southern Rockies, and southern High Plains...

...Coastal rain and inland snow to continue across parts of

An active weather pattern will begin to take shape later today and
extend into early this weekend as a multifaceted weather system
develops over the central United States. Before this system
develops, there is the chance for isolated instances of flash
flooding and severe weather along a quasi-stationary boundary
extending from the middle Mississippi Valley to the Central
Plains. A Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall is in
effect for today from southeast Nebraska and eastern Kansas into
much of Missouri, where rainfall amounts over an inch could pose
isolated flash flooding concerns. The Storm Prediction Center has
issued a Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe weather over western
Nebraska, and a larger Marginal Risk (level 1/5) that extends
southward and just east of dryline throughout the central and
southern Plains today. An isolated tornado, large hail, and a
damaging wind gust are possible with thunderstorm activity in the
aforementioned area. By early this evening, a negatively tilted
upper-level trough crossing the Intermountain West will facilitate
lee-cyclogenesis and lead to a developing precipitation shield
over the northern Rockies. Heavy snow is forecast across parts of
Montana, Idaho, and northwest Wyoming, with moderate snowfall
accumulations confined to regions above 5000 feet in elevation. In
advance of the wintry weather, Winter Storm Warnings are in effect
through Friday night over portions of central Montana. South of
the winter weather, a few damaging wind gusts and some hail can't
be ruled out across southeast Idaho, northern Utah, and southwest
Wyoming as elevated thunderstorms develop overhead. A strong low
pressure system will emerge over the central Plains by Friday
afternoon as the upper-level trough begins to close off while
propagating eastward. This will lead to an expanding precipitation
shield over the northern Plains and Mid-Mississippi Valley.
Widespread rainfall amounts up to, and locally exceeding, 2 inches
within a developing commahead region of the low may produce
scattered areas of flash flooding from south-central North Dakota
to central South Dakota, where sensitive hydrologic conditions
reside. Accordingly, a Slight Risk (level 2/4) of excessive
rainfall is in effect for this region. Over the central Plains,
there is higher confidence that severe thunderstorms capable all
hazard types will impact an area extending from southeast Nebraska
to north-central Oklahoma, prompting SPC to issue an Enhanced Risk
(level 3/5) of severe weather. Thunderstorms forming ahead of a
dryline and approaching cold front in a sheared and unstable
airmass may contain tornadoes and produce significant hail. With
multiple strong storms, heavy rainfall rates are also likely and
could lead to isolated flash flood concerns. By Saturday, the
maturing low pressure system will support additional locally heavy
rain over the northern Plains, with wet snowflakes mixing into the
northern High Plains and Black Hills. Heavy rain and severe
thunderstorms will also remain possible along the advancing cold
front forecast to extend from the Midwest to the Southern Plains.

Fire weather is also a potential hazard across the Southwest,
southern Rockies, and southern High Plains over the next few days.
The combination of gusty southwesterly winds, low relative
humidity, above average temperatures, and dry terrain will lead to
critical to extreme fire weather conditions today and Friday. More
specifically, SPC has issued an area of extreme fire weather
danger over parts of southeast Colorado on Friday where an
outbreak of dangerous fire weather conditions is anticipated. Any
new wildfires could start with ease and new/existing fires may
spread uncontrollably. Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches
are in effect over southern Nevada, northern Arizona, the entire
state of New Mexico, parts of southern Colorado, West Texas and
the Texas Panhandle, as well as western Oklahoma. A period of
favorable fire weather condtions this weekend is noted over the
southern Plains in the SPC extended fire weather outlook as well,
which will need monitored over the next few days.

Elsewhere, a wobbling upper-level low located over the Gulf of
Maine will maintain unsettled weather over northern New England
over the next few days. Northern Maine in particular will
experience the greatest impacts, with snowfall accumulations up to
5 inches and gusty winds possible throughout northern portions of
the state, where a Winter Weather Advisory remains until tomorrow
morning. Conditions will finally begin to improve on Saturday as
the system gradually slides further into the Atlantic. Meanwhile,
an attached cold front is currently found near south-central
Florida, with increasing thunderstorm activity noted ahead of the
front. A targeted Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall remains
along the southeastern Florida Atlantic coastline for urban flash
flood concerns. Behind this cold front much of the eastern U.S.
will experience a chilly end of the workweek. In fact, lows into
the upper 20s and low 30s will likely lead to frost/freeze
concerns over parts of the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic through
tomorrow morning. The combination of post-frontal dry air and
gusty winds over the Mid-Atlantic will also lead to elevated fire
weather concerns. Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag Warnings have
been issued for parts of eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey
through this evening.


Lastly, a frontal system entering the Pacific Northwest early
Saturday will spread lower elevation/coastal rain and mountain
snow into the region. Precipitation amounts are expected to remain
under an inch.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0104 AM CDT Fri Apr 29 2022

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...SOUTHEAST COLORADO...SOUTHWEST KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move across the central Rockies
today. The mid-level jet will move over portions of northern New
Mexico and southern Colorado during peak heating hours. At the
surface, a deep surface low will develop in western Kansas and drive
strong surface winds across the southern High Plains.

...Northeast New Mexico...southeast Colorado...southwest Kansas...
Strong downslope winds in excess of 30 mph are expected to occur in
the lee of the Sangre de Cristos. Widespread single-digit RH is
expected to develop by late-morning/early-afternoon. Widespread ERCs
above the 90th percentile will support extreme fire behavior under
these meteorological conditions. Towards the end of the afternoon, a
cold front will move through southeast Colorado and southwest
Kansas. Winds will shift from westerly to northwesterly. Despite
some RH recovery behind the front, confidence remains high that
several hours of Extremely Critical conditions will occur.

Elsewhere across the southern High Plains, Elevated to Critical
conditions are expected during the afternoon in the post-dryline
environment. RH will be similarly low across the broader region, but
winds will only reach 15-25 mph.

...Mid-Atlantic...
This evening's observed soundings from the Northeast into
southeastern Canada show a very dry low-level airmass. A strong
upper-low off of the northeast coast will couple with a high
pressure system in Canada to promote gusty offshore northwesterly
winds. Fine fuels are quite dry in this region. With RH falling
below 20% in some locations, 15-20 mph winds will bring Elevated
fire weather concerns.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, the upper-level trough will move northeast out of the
Plains and into the upper Midwest along with the surface cyclone.
Across the West and High Plains, upper-level ridging will develop.
This pattern will not favor strong surface winds across the
Southwest and adjacent High Plains, where dry fuels will remain.
Some areas may see briefly Elevated conditions behind the cold
front. This appears most likely to occur in parts of northwest Texas
into the South Plains. As meteorological conditions will be marginal
an brief, no highlights will be added.

Valid 12Z Mon May 02 2022 - 12Z Fri May 06 2022

...Overview...

Expect an active weather pattern next week with a series of
Pacific systems (each supported by an upper trough that may
contain a closed low for a period of time) entering and
progressing across the lower 48. These systems will spread rain
and high elevation snow across the Pacific Northwest and
north-central Rockies/High Plains, and then mostly rain over a
large part of the central/eastern U.S. Some areas of precipitation
may be heavy and SPC indicates a threat of severe weather over the
southern Plains and vicinity Monday into Tuesday. WPC has also
issued an experimental medium range "slight" risk for excessive
rainfall then from the eastern southern Plains into the
mid-Mississippi Valley. Upstream this pattern will likely leave
the southern half or third of the West, the northern Plains near
the Canadian border, and the Gulf Coast as the relatively drier
areas during the forecast period. As for individual features, a
leading system will weaken as it tracks northeast from the Upper
Mississippi Valley Sunday onward while another over the West by
early Sunday should reach the Midwest/Great Lakes by Tuesday and
the next one entering the West by Monday may reach as far east as
the Mississippi Valley by next Thursday. A larger scale upper
trough approaching the West Coast next Thursday may also bring
some moisture into the Northwest.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from best
clustered guidance from the 18 UTC GFS and 12 UTC ECMWF along with
a compatible 01 UTC National Blend of Models (NBM) Days 3-5
(Monday into Wednesday). This solution maintains good WPC
continuity and has strong ensemble support in a pattern with
seemingly above normal forecast predictability. Increasing
forecast spread, particularly with embedded system progression
variance, portends near average predictability into days 6/7
(Thursday/next Friday). Opted to embrace a transition to a
composite blend of the still compatible 18 UTC GEFS mean and the
12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC NBM that seem to
offer a reasonable flow evolution into these longer time frames.
Latest 00 UTC guidance remains in line.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

Over the West, yet another system will spread moisture from the
Pacific Northwest through the Rockies into early to mid next week.
Depending on exact system details, this could produce some
enhanced totals, including accumulating snows into the
north-central Rockies and adjacent High Plains. Subsequently, an
amplified upper trough and surface frontal system still expected
to breach the West Coast Thursday into next Friday should bring a
renewed precipitation focus into the Pacific Northwest and
increasingly inland.

Over the central/eastern U.S., the leading surface low tracking
out of the Great Lakes on Monday and associated fronts will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern U.S. with generally light
to moderate rain. Potential exists for pockets of locally heavier
activity though. The trailing cold front will tend to stall over
the southern Plains while the next system emerges from the West,
with this system currently expected to track through the
Plains/Midwest early next week. Currently there remains decent
potential for  areas of moderate to heavy rainfall from portions
of the central/southern Plains northeastward to include a focus
for a "slight" risk of excessive rainfall into Monday/Tuesday over
the south-central U.S. Some severe weather is also possible, with
the Storm Prediction Center currently indicating the best
potential for severe thunderstorms across the southern Plains
Sunday and Monday. The guidance signal is also growing that the
next system in the series out from the West may produce yet
another area of significant rainfall over and out from the central
U.S. again mid-late next week. Confidence is fairly low for
details of coverage and timing. A system on the deepest side of
the spread could produce some snow in the northern periphery, but
this has fairly low probability at the moment.  Some areas over
the central U.S. need to monitor forecasts of these systems given
the potential to produce significant weather and sensitivity to
additional rainfall.  At least for the time being, the majority of
forecasts produce most precipitation to the south of the far
northern Plains where soil conditions are the wettest.

...Heavy rain and severe thunderstorms for portions of the Plains
and Ohio Valley on Friday and Saturday...

...There is an Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Central/Southern High Plains on Friday...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over parts
of the Northern High Plains/Northern Rockies...

Friday, a strong storm over the Central Plains will slowly move
northeastward to the Upper Mississippi Valley by Sunday. The
system will pull moisture northward over the Plains and the
associated front will destabilize the atmosphere producing showers
and thunderstorms over the Plains on Friday and into the Ohio
Valley on Saturday. Therefore, the SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk
of severe thunderstorms over the Central/Southern Plains through
Saturday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. In addition, there is an increased risk of EF2 to
EF5 tornadoes and hail two inches or greater associated with some
of these thunderstorms.

In addition, heavy rain will develop farther to the northwest over
the Northern Plains with a strong moisture inflow. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over the
Northern Plains. The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams being the most vulnerable through Saturday morning.

Under a deep upper-level low, even farther northwest, temperatures
will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over parts of the Northern
High Plains/Northern Rockies. With moisture moving into the
Northern Rockies, snow will develop over parts of the region
through Saturday morning.

On Saturday, the threat of severe thunderstorms moves eastward to
the Western Ohio Valley. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Western Ohio Valley
on Saturday into Sunday morning. The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.

However, the excessive rainfall threat will lower and cover two
areas on Saturday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk
of excessive rainfall over parts of the Northern Plains/Upper
Mississippi Valley and a second over parts of the Ohio/Tennessee
Valleys and Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday into Sunday
morning. The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of
flash flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with
heavy rain.

Meanwhile, a front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest
overnight Friday, moving inland to the Great Basin by Sunday. The
system will begin to produce coastal rain and highest elevation
snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest on Friday. The rain and
highest elevation snow will move inland to the Northern
Intermountain Region on Saturday afternoon into Sunday.

Furthermore, the SPC has issued an Extreme Risk of fire weather
over parts of the Central/Southern High Plains on Friday. The fire
weather risk is due to strong gusty winds, dry fuels, and low
relative humidity.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1016 AM CST Fri Jan 14 2022

Valid 141700Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF TRANS-PECOS AND
PERMIAN BASIN...

The overall forecast remains valid with minor adjustments to the
elevated area along the northwestern periphery. Morning observations
show warmer temperatures ahead of the front suggesting a greater
risk of sustained elevated conditions early this morning. Elsewhere,
the forecast remains unchanged. See the previous discussion for more
information.

..Lyons.. 01/14/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CST Fri Jan 14 2022/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough currently in the Northern Rockies will
continue southeastward today. A surface cyclone in the central High
Plains will deepen and move through the southern Plains. A fast
moving cold front, particularly within the High Plains region, will
reach the Rio Grande and lower Texas Gulf Coast by Saturday morning.

...Southern High Plains Vicinity...
Dry and windy conditions can be expected both ahead of and behind
the advancing cold front. Mid/upper-level moisture is evident on
water-vapor imagery across much of the Southwest. This moisture will
continue to move into the region ahead of the upper trough. Forecast
soundings also show this moisture and the possibility for cloud
cover. This will impact boundary-layer heating and mixing
efficiency. With the cold front, winds will rapidly shift to the
north. RH could stay around 20% for a brief time along with gusty
winds. Critical fire weather appears most likely from the Davis
Mountains into parts of the Permian Basin. There, a better signal
for RH at or just below 15% exists along with winds near 20 mph.
Critical conditions may occur locally in parts of the eastern New
Mexico into the Texas Panhandle and South Plains. However, the
negative impacts of cloud cover and RH recovery behind the front
keep the duration and spatial extent too in doubt for highlights.
Drought-impacted fuels will continue to support fire spread within
the region.

...Major winter storm to impact the Northeast through Monday...


...Overview...

A potent closed low moving through the Mid-Atlantic as the period
starts Monday will continue to spread heavy snow into parts of the
Northeast. Behind this, general troughiness will continue across
the Great Lakes next week as the next amplified shortwave drops
through the Plains and into the East next Thursday and Friday. Out
West, a closed low off the southern California coast will weaken
as it slides East, with weak shortwaves periodically acting to
break down ridging situated over the Northwest before a stronger
shortwave tries to move in late in the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles have come into closer agreement regarding the
ongoing major winter storm as the period starts moving into the
Northeast. This lends to increased confidence in the specifics,
though some uncertainty still lingers. Most if not all of the
guidance now shows the low inland over the Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning (near Philadelphia), although the UKMET is still displaced
a little south and the GEFS mean remains a bit farther east
showing the low right along the coast. Of course, even minor
changes in the low track can have bigger effects on winter precip
and type across especially eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast.

Elsewhere, there's fairly good agreement on general and reinforced
troughing across the Great Lakes next week, with some minor
differences in the details. A stronger shortwave looks to drop
through the Plains mid to late next week and eventually into the
East. Some recent model runs (mostly the CMC) indicate another
potential low pressure area near the East Coast, but uncertainty
in the strength of this system is highly uncertain at this time.
Out West, the greatest differences begin to pop up next
Thursday-Friday with the handling of Pacific system energy into an
upper ridge off/over the West Coast. The 06z GFS is more ernest
with a shortwave through the east Pacific and even shows a closed
low off the Pacific Northwest coast next Friday. Meanwhile, the
CMC and ECMWF are both weaker and more deflects the energy over
the ridge. The ensemble means tend to favor a solution closer to
the ECMWF and CMC.

The WPC forecast for today used a composite blend of the
deterministic models days 3-5, with increasing ensemble means
thereafter to account for detail differences across the East late
period and the energy off/over the Northwest. This provided a
consistent forecast with overnight WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A major winter low developing over the weekend seems set to lift
from the northern Mid-Atlantic/lower Great Lakes through the
Northeast on Monday. This will present a continuing full array of
weather hazards and threats. Heavy wrapping snows will spread in
earnest along/on the backside of the deepening low and west of the
I-95 corridor into interior areas. For locations closer to the
coast, precipitation may start out as some brief snow, with a
changeover to sleet and rain as warmer air filters in from the
east. Gusty winds surrounding the surface low may create high
waves off the coast leading to possible coastal flood concerns
along the Northeast coastline.

After the main low exits the Northeast by Tuesday, another low
pressure system is forecast to track over the north-central U.S.
in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring some snow to the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes then northern New England, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain may develop
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast for mid-later
next week with modest return Gulf flow with induced wave passages.

For temperatures, the East should moderate back towards normal
after Monday's storm with colder temperatures moving back in by
the end of the week. The Central U.S. will start mild and above
normal early in the week, though as strong Canadian high pressure
sinks southward, will quickly trend below to well below normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Daytime highs could be near or below zero
across parts of the northern Plains and northern Mississippi
Valley. West of the Rockies should be mostly near or slightly
above normal influenced by the upper level ridge.

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

The overall forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments to
the Elevated area for the latest guidance. Elevated and locally
critical conditions still appear most probable within proximity to
the Rio Grande Valley where stronger winds and warmer temperatures
should last through the day. However, periods of elevated conditions
will likely extend eastward behind the cold front, though the
longevity of sustained elevated conditions remains uncertain. See
the previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 01/14/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1259 AM CST Fri Jan 14 2022/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough within the southern Plains will slowly become
more negatively tilted on Saturday. The motion of this feature will
slowly become more easterly. Deep northwesterly winds will impact
the southern Plains.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Though temperatures will be cooler behind the cold front, subsidence
on the southern/western flank of the upper-level trough should allow
for clear skies. Boundary-layer mixing should be relatively
efficient and promote gusty winds across the region. Winds of around
20-25 mph are expected. There is some question as to how long low RH
will exist given the persistent cold air advection. At present, RH
is forecast to broadly settle to around 20% with perhaps some
locations seeing less than 20%. Locally critical conditions are most
likely within and near the Rio Grande Valley. Drought-impacted and
freeze-cured fuels will support fire growth.

FOR SATURDAY JANUARY 22 - FRIDAY JANUARY 28: There is good agreement among =
the
model guidance in predicting broad 500-hPa troughing over the central and
eastern CONUS, with ridging forecast upstream over the Northeast Pacific an=
d
western North America. This pattern favors anomalous northwesterly mid-leve=
l
flow over much of the CONUS, which will act to bring waves of Arctic air
southward out of Canada coinciding with the coldest time of the year
climatologically. As a result, some areas, particularly along the Eastern
Seaboard, may experience the coldest temperatures of the winter season so f=
ar.
A surge of anomalously cold air is forecast across the East during late
week-1,
with some moderation around day-8 (Jan 22), followed by another surge of
Arctic
cold in the early to middle part of week-2. A high risk for much below norm=
al
minimum temperatures is posted for Jan 23-25 over parts of the Upper and
Middle
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, eastern Ohio Valley, Southeast, Mid-Atlant=
ic,
and Northeast, with enhanced snow cover favored over the Appalachians and
interior Northeast preventing the air mass from warming as it approaches th=
e
Eastern Seaboard. The most anomalous cold is forecast across the Upper Midw=
est
on day-9 (Jan 23), before moving toward the East Coast on days 10 and 11 (J=
an
24-25). The ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools depict probabilities greater th=
an
60 percent for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th climatological
percentile across the highlighted high risk area. Uncalibrated guidance fro=
m
the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depicts widespread subzero (deg F) temperature=
s
across the Upper Midwest, with single digits and teens indicated over porti=
ons
of the Ohio Valley, Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast.



A moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for much of th=
e
eastern CONUS from Jan 22-27 where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depi=
ct
at least a 40 percent chance minimum temperatures drop below the 15th
climatological percentile. The anomalous cold is forecast to expand southwa=
rd
to the Central Gulf of Mexico Coast and the Northern Florida Peninsula by t=
he
middle of week-2, where there are elevated probabilities (20-40 percent) of
subfreezing temperatures. A slight risk for much below normal temperatures =
is
posted for much of the central and eastern CONUS, for all of week-2. Both t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict elevated probabilities (at least 20%=
)
of
temperatures dropping below 40 deg F extending into parts of South Florida
heightening frost concerns over the region and potential impacts to
agriculture.



Early in week-2, the synoptic pattern is forecast to remain favorable for
increased northwesterly flow across the northeastern CONUS with intermitten=
t
shortwaves diving southward out of Canada. This favors increased chances of
snow across the region, with lake effect snow also likely. This potential i=
s
further enhanced by a southern stream low pressure system that is forecast =
to
track near the East Coast early in week-2, although the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles generally depict a track further out to sea. As such, a slight ri=
sk
for heavy snow is posted for the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, a=
nd
Northeast Jan 22-24. Snow chances decrease later in week-2 as the troughing
shifts more to the east and lake temperatures decrease as a result of the
persistent cold forecast during the next 2 weeks.



Anomalous ridging and surface high pressure is forecast across the Northeas=
t
Pacific and Alaska during much of week-2, promoting increased southerly flo=
w
across Alaska. Additionally, troughing and associated surface low pressure
forecast over the north-central Pacific is forecast to move closer to Alask=
a,
which will result in strengthening pressure gradients and an enhancement of
the
southerly flow, both at the mid-levels and the surface. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict some areas along the southern coast of the Mainland
and
the northern Panhandle having at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day
precipitation exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 2-inches dur=
ing
the early and middle parts of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted along the southern coast of Mainland Alaska, parts =
of
the Alaska Peninsula, and the northern Alaska Panhandle Jan 22-26. An
accompanying slight risk of high winds is also posted for the many of these
same areas, Jan 22-26, but extends farther west to include all of the Alask=
a
Peninsula (relative to the slight risk for heavy precipitation) and farther
east to include the central Alaska Panhandle. The slight risk for high wind=
s
is
supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool, which depicts at least a 20% chance=
 of
wind speeds exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 25-mph over th=
ese
areas. The eastward expansion into the central Alaska Panhandle is supporte=
d
by
a favorable synoptic setup increasing the potential for low-level barrier j=
ets
along coastal areas.

...Snow will dive southward from the northern Plains/Midwest into
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into Saturday as a low pressure system
intensifies...

...Snow and mixed precipitation will overspread the Tennessee
Valley and up the Appalachians Saturday night into Sunday as the
low pressure system tracks up the East Coast...

...Freezing rain/sleet likely along the Piedmont section of
Georgia and the Carolinas Saturday night, spreading up the I-95
corridor on Sunday...

The stage is set for a low pressure system to consolidate and
intensify as it moves across the Deep South into the Southeast
during the weekend.  Arctic air settling into the Plains and the
Ohio Valley will interact with the low pressure system to push an
area moderate to locally heavy snow down the mid-section of the
country through tonight.  As the arctic air works farther south,
rain that initially falls in areas farther south is forecast to
change over to a period of freezing rain and/or sleet before
changing over to snow.  This change over from rain to snow is
expected to impact areas as far south as Arkansas and Tennessee
Saturday to Saturday night.  The rain will expand into the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on Saturday as the low pressure
system begins to intensify and track eastward across the Deep
South.  Farther east over Piedmont section of Georgia and the
Carolinas, it appears that a significant icing event is store
beginning Saturday night before spreading up the I-95 corridor
during the day on Sunday as the low pressure system begins to
track up the East Coast.  Meanwhile, arctic air farther inland
will support widespread snow and areas of mixed precipitation from
the Tennessee Valley/upper Ohio Valley to much of the Appalachians
on Sunday.  The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous
driving conditions on roads.

Meanwhile, a rapidly deepening area of low pressure system well
off the East Coast will drag arctic air from eastern Canada into
the Northeast, bringing frigid conditions, strong gusty winds and
dangerous wind chill into Saturday.  Some light snow will brush
Cape Cod and Downeast Maine into tonight before a high pressure
system brings calmer weather into much of the Northeast by
Saturday night.

Elsewhere, an upper-level low off the southern California coast
will aid in producing light rain over parts of southern California
on Saturday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 20 - 24 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in excellent agreemen=
t in depicting an amplified
500-hPa flow pattern across the forecast domain. Mean troughing is forecast
over the Aleutians while strong ridging looks to dominate downstream across
most of western North America. Deep troughing is predicted over central and
eastern North America. In addition to the highly amplified mean pattern, da=
ily
model output for the 6-10 day period indicates a remarkably stable pattern
with
the locations of the overall features changing little from day to day. This
day
to day stability indicates that the overall amplified pattern will likely
remain locked in place for the duration of the period.

With strong troughing forecast across central and eastern North America,
probabilities of below normal temperatures are elevated across the CONUS fr=
om
the Great Plains eastward to the Eastern Seaboard. With a highly amplified =
and
stable pattern in place, confidence in a cold pattern is high, with
probabilities of below normal temperatures exceeding 80 percent for the Gre=
at
Lakes region. Additionally, confidence is growing that the cold air mass wi=
ll
expand southward, with elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures =
now
encompassing the entire Gulf Coast and Florida Peninsula. Conversely, with
ridging expected across western North America, above normal temperatures ar=
e
favored for much of the western third of the CONUS as well as most of Alask=
a.

With a cold, stable air mass in place, below normal precipitation is likely
across much of the Central Plains, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Ohio Vall=
ey,
with a tilt toward below normal precipitation extending into parts of the
Northeast. Probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated farther=
 to
the south, across the Gulf Coast Region, Rio Grande Valley, and coastal
regions
of the Southeast, near the base of the expansive trough forecast over easte=
rn
North America. Above normal precipitation is also slightly favored across
parts
of the Northern Plains and Great Lakes as weak disturbances may affect thes=
e
regions. Additionally, most of the Great Lakes remain ice free and the
predicted mean low level winds are favorable for lake effect snow downwind =
of
the western Great Lakes. Conversely, a dry pattern is likely for the wester=
n
CONUS as strong ridging is forecast to dominate. Above normal precipitation=
 is
favored for most of Alaska, ahead of a mean surface low predicted near the
Aleutians.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 22 - 28 2022

A highly amplified 500-hPa pattern is forecast to persist across the foreca=
st
domain for week-2, especially early in the period. Models are in good
agreement
in maintaining a strong ridge-trough pattern with above normal heights like=
ly
over western North America and below normal heights predicted across the Ea=
st.
Daily model solutions indicate that the highly amplified pattern will conti=
nue
through at least the middle of the week-2 period with perhaps some
de-amplification by day 14. It should be noted that strong ridging is forec=
ast
to persist across Alaska throughout the period, particularly in the GEFS mo=
del
solutions, so the potential for an overall pattern de-amplification near th=
e
end of week-2 is still highly uncertain.

With a highly amplified pattern expected to continue through at least the
middle of Week-2, below normal temperatures remain favored for the eastern
half
of the CONUS. Probabilities of below normal temperatures exceed 80 percent =
for
the eastern Great Lakes, where the cold pattern is likely to persist for th=
e
duration of Week-2. Conversely, forecast ridging leads to elevated
probabilities of above normal temperatures across much of the western CONUS=
.
An
exception is for parts of the Great Basin, where strong surface high pressu=
re
may promote cold air inversions. Mean southerly flow and ridging predicted
across Alaska favor above normal temperatures across most of the state.
Probabilities of above normal temperatures exceed 70 percent for parts of t=
he
southeastern Mainland, where a very strong warm signal is noted among the
models early in the period.

Surface high pressure associated with a cold, stable air mass in the East a=
nd
strong ridging across the West, favors a dry pattern across most of the CON=
US.
Weak disturbances are possible for parts of the Northern Plains and Great
Lakes, leading to slightly elevated probabilities for near to above normal
precipitation for these regions. Additionally, a favorable setup for lake
effect snows is likely to persist into Week-2, especially downwind of the
western Great Lakes. Slightly elevated probabilities of near to above norma=
l
precipitation are indicated for much of the southern tier of the CONUS and =
the
immediate East Coast along the periphery of the large scale trough predicte=
d
over eastern North America. Near to above normal precipitation is also favo=
red
for Alaska, ahead of surface low pressure predicted over the Aleutians. A
drying trend is possible across much of the state toward the end of week-2,=
 if
the surface low pressure retrogrades far enough to the west, as suggested b=
y
the daily ensemble mean solutions.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted highly amplified mean pattern offset slightly by increased
uncertainty near the end of Week-2.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

The stage is set for a low pressure system to consolidate and

during the weekend.  Arctic air settling into the Plains and the
Ohio Valley will interact with the low pressure system to push an
area moderate to locally heavy snow down the mid-section of the
country through tonight.  As the arctic air works farther south,
rain that initially falls in areas farther south is forecast to
change over to a period of freezing rain and/or sleet before
changing over to snow.  This change over from rain to snow is
expected to impact areas as far south as Arkansas and Tennessee
Saturday to Saturday night.  The rain will then expand into the
lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys on Saturday as the low
pressure system begins to intensify and track eastward across the
Deep South.  Farther east over the Piedmont section of Georgia and
the Carolinas, it appears that a significant icing event is in
store beginning Saturday night before spreading up the I-95
corridor during the day on Sunday as the low pressure system
tracks up the East Coast.  Meanwhile, arctic air farther inland
will support widespread snow and areas of mixed precipitation from
the Tennessee Valley/upper Ohio Valley to much of the Appalachians
on Sunday.  The combination of snow and ice will likely cause
hazardous driving conditions on roads.

Meanwhile, a rapidly deepening area of low pressure system well
off the East Coast will drag arctic air from eastern Canada into
the Northeast, bringing frigid conditions, strong gusty winds and
dangerous wind chill temperatures through tonight and into
Saturday.  Some light snow will brush Cape Cod and Downeast Maine
into tonight before a high pressure system pushes the snow out to
sea and brings calmer winds into much of the Northeast by Saturday
night.

Elsewhere, an upper-level low off the southern California coast
will aid in producing light rain over parts of southern California
on Saturday.

...Major winter storm to impact the Northeast through Monday...


...Overview...

A potent closed low moving through the Mid-Atlantic as the period
starts Monday will continue to spread heavy snow into parts of the
Northeast. Behind this, general troughiness will continue across
the Great Lakes next week as the next amplified shortwave drops
through the Plains and into the East next Thursday and Friday. Out
West, a closed low off the southern California coast will weaken
as it slides East, with weak shortwaves periodically acting to
break down ridging situated over the Northwest before a stronger
shortwave tries to move in late in the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles have come into closer agreement regarding the
ongoing major winter storm as the period starts moving into the
Northeast. This lends to increased confidence in the specifics,
though some uncertainty still lingers. Most if not all of the
guidance now shows the low inland over the Mid-Atlantic Monday
morning (near Philadelphia), although the UKMET is still displaced
a little south and the GEFS mean remains a bit farther east
showing the low right along the coast. Of course, even minor
changes in the low track can have bigger effects on winter precip
and type across especially eastern portions of the Mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast.

Elsewhere, there's fairly good agreement on general and reinforced
troughing across the Great Lakes next week, with some minor
differences in the details. A stronger shortwave looks to drop
through the Plains mid to late next week and eventually into the
East. Some recent model runs (mostly the CMC) indicate another
potential low pressure area near the East Coast, but uncertainty
in the strength of this system is highly uncertain at this time.
Out West, the greatest differences begin to pop up next
Thursday-Friday with the handling of Pacific system energy into an
upper ridge off/over the West Coast. The 06z GFS is more ernest
with a shortwave through the east Pacific and even shows a closed
low off the Pacific Northwest coast next Friday. Meanwhile, the
CMC and ECMWF are both weaker and more deflects the energy over
the ridge. The ensemble means tend to favor a solution closer to
the ECMWF and CMC.

The WPC forecast for today used a composite blend of the
deterministic models days 3-5, with increasing ensemble means
thereafter to account for detail differences across the East late
period and the energy off/over the Northwest. This provided a
consistent forecast with overnight WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A major winter low developing over the weekend seems set to lift
from the northern Mid-Atlantic/lower Great Lakes through the
Northeast on Monday. This will present a continuing full array of
weather hazards and threats. Heavy wrapping snows will spread in
earnest along/on the backside of the deepening low and west of the
I-95 corridor into interior areas. For locations closer to the
coast, precipitation may start out as some brief snow, with a
changeover to sleet and rain as warmer air filters in from the
east. Gusty winds surrounding the surface low may create high
waves off the coast leading to possible coastal flood concerns
along the Northeast coastline.

After the main low exits the Northeast by Tuesday, another low
pressure system is forecast to track over the north-central U.S.
in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring some snow to the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes then northern New England, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain may develop
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast for mid-later
next week with modest return Gulf flow with induced wave passages.

For temperatures, the East should moderate back towards normal
after Monday's storm with colder temperatures moving back in by
the end of the week. The Central U.S. will start mild and above
normal early in the week, though as strong Canadian high pressure
sinks southward, will quickly trend below to well below normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Daytime highs could be near or below zero
across parts of the northern Plains and northern Mississippi
Valley. West of the Rockies should be mostly near or slightly
above normal influenced by the upper level ridge.

east. Gusty winds surrounding the surface low may create high
waves off the coast leading to possible coastal flood concerns
along the Northeast coastline.

After the main low exits the Northeast by Tuesday, another low
pressure system is forecast to track over the north-central U.S.
in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring some snow to the
Upper Midwest and Great Lakes then northern New England, with
possibly higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The
West could see some light precipitation during the period,
particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern
Rockies, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain may develop
across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast for mid-later
next week with modest return Gulf flow with induced wave passages.

For temperatures, the East should moderate back towards normal
after Monday's storm with colder temperatures moving back in by
the end of the week. The Central U.S. will start mild and above
normal early in the week, though as strong Canadian high pressure
sinks southward, will quickly trend below to well below normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Daytime highs could be near or below zero
across parts of the northern Plains and northern Mississippi
Valley. West of the Rockies should be mostly near or slightly
above normal influenced by the upper level ridge.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE RIO GRANDE
VALLEY...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper trough will pivot through the southern Plains and
into the lower Mississippi Valley today. Strong northwesterly winds
within the lowest few kilometers of the atmosphere will support
elevated to critical fire weather across parts of the Rio Grande
Valley vicinity. Drought-impacted and freeze-cured fuels will
support fire spread in the region.

...Rio Grande Valley...
Winds remain the highest-confidence portion of the forecast. 20-25
mph will be possible in many areas. Strong winds just above the
surface coupled with relatively efficient boundary-layer mixing will
allow for gusts up to 40 mph. Cold air advection will be strong in
the post-frontal environment. However, most guidance has trended
warmer and drier over the past day. Given how dry the airmass is, as
sampled by Friday evenings Midland sounding, these trends seem
reasonable. Strong winds will act to promote fire spread even if RH
only reduces to 20-25%. Critical fire weather is most likely within
and near the Rio Grande Valley. RH below 20% is more uncertain away
from the Valley.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 AM EST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Jan 18 2022 - 12Z Sat Jan 22 2022

...Pattern Overview...

Guidance overall agrees that a mean upper ridge will amplify off
the West Coast mid-later next week. Downstream, this should force
an increasingly dominant series of northern stream impulses dig
down from Canada to carve out a large and central U.S. centered
mean upper trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC forecast suite was mainly derived from a composite blend
of reasonably well clustered solutions from the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5 (Tue-Thu) along with the 01 UTC
NBM in a pattern with seemingly above normal predictability. WPC
product continuity is well maintained. Forecast spread and model
run to run consistency become a bit less manageable into days 6/7
(Fri-next Saturday). Prefer a composite of the larger scale
compatible 18 UTC GEFS mean and 12 UTC NAEFS/ECMWF ensemble means
to maintain max WPC product continuity beyond less predictable
smaller scale embedded system detail. Overall, the resultant
solution seems reasonable and a similar pattern
amplification/evolution is depicted with composite of newer 12 UTC
model and ensemble runs.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A significant winter storm is slated to exit still windy New
England to the Canadian Maritimes by Tuesday as another organized
low pressure system digs into the north-central U.S. Low
development and subsequent track roughly eastward along the
U.S./Canadian border into Wed/Thu will bring some snow to the
Upper Midwest, Great Lakes then northern New England, with locally
higher totals expected near typical lake enhancement areas as cold
high pressure sweeps down across the central and eastern U.S. in
the wake of the low. Guidance varies with potential focus, but
suspect the wavy trailing cold front on the leading edge of this
Arctic blast will gain at least modest moisture from the Gulf of
Mexico to fuel an emerging area of precipitation over the
Southeast that offers some later next week potential for
overrunning snow/ice on the northern periphery of activity. The
Canadian and some ensemble members are more robust with
frontal/coastal wave amplitude and precipitation extent across the
region and over the East Coast at these longer time periods. The
main upper trough position is far enough West to not discount this
possibility.

Meanwhile, The West could see some light precipitation through the
period, particularly over the Pacific Northwest and into the
Northern Rockies as weakening systems cross the region, with
mainly dry conditions elsewhere.

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the wake of a strong upper trough moving through the Gulf Coast
states, another upstream trough will move through the northern
Rockies and adjacent Plains on Sunday. Weak surface troughing in the
southern High Plains will lead to a fairly quick turn-around to
westerly/southwesterly winds. While the airmass will remain quite
dry, only locally elevated conditions are expected as most areas
will see light winds.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 AM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast of elevated fire
weather conditions across a large portion of the Great Basin today
(see previous discussion below).  Regarding isolated dry
thunderstorm potential in central and southern New Mexico, the area
was extended eastward to capture the Sacramento Mountains.  Despite
slow storm motions and slightly higher PW values (around 0.75")
here, the number and concentration of CG flashes should be higher
than areas to the west.  As a result, the potential for at least
isolated lightning flashes to occur outside of areas with wetting
rains should exist.

..Jirak.. 06/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0110 AM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water vapor imagery reveals broad upper-level ridging
over the south-central CONUS and a trough over the eastern Pacific.
This trough is forecast to gradually shift east over the next 24
hours, which will result in modest surface pressure falls over the
western Great Basin/Pacific Northwest this afternoon and augment
mid-level flow over the region. Consequently, strengthening winds
will support fire weather concerns for much of the Great Basin today
given antecedent hot and dry conditions.

...Great Basin...
Observations and recent guidance continue to suggest a high
probability for widespread elevated fire weather conditions this
afternoon across a large swath of the Great Basin. Regional 00Z
soundings show very dry boundary layer conditions, and poor
overnight RH recoveries are noted. South to southwesterly winds will
increase by mid afternoon to 15-20 mph as the surface low begins to
consolidate over northern NV into OR. Strong diurnal heating will
drive deep boundary-layer mixing, resulting in single-digit relative
humidity values and allow downward transport of stronger mid-level
flow to the surface. Ongoing fires in the region are indicative of
receptive fuels amid severe drought conditions. Widespread elevated
conditions are expected, and some areas may see periods of critical
conditions as winds gust to 20-25 mph (possibly up to 30 mph for
terrain-favored locations).

...New Mexico...
Mid-level moisture on top of a deep, dry boundary layer is noted in
the 00Z EPZ sounding. Weak flow over the region will help keep this
moisture in place over southern NM, and support 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE
as isolated to scattered convection develops off the high terrain of
the southern Rockies this afternoon. This thermodynamic environment
should support at least a few dry lightning strikes across southern
and central NM where fuels are receptive. Dry lightning will be
possible across east/southeast NM, but slow storm motions and
improving moisture quality suggest a lower dry lightning potential.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
231 PM EDT Sun Jun 13 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Jun 16 2021 - 12Z Sun Jun 20 2021

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California through the
end of the week...


...Overview...

A very strong upper ridge centered over the Four Corners states
will remain a dominant feature in the pattern through the period
but should gradually weaken and drift a bit southward by next
weekend.  Long-term mean troughing over eastern North America will
consist of a leading East Coast trough that departs after Thursday
followed by moderately amplifying energy over western-central
parts of southern Canada and northern tier U.S. (and possibly some
trailing flow from Canada).  This amplifying energy will push a
front across the northern half of the lower 48 through the period,
with the trailing part of the front likely stalling over the
central Plains/Rockies.  Pacific flow should bring another
shortwave/upper low and leading frontal system into western Canada
and northwestern U.S. next weekend.  The western upper ridge will
support a hazardous heat wave event over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies and extending into California during the latter half
of the week, with a broad area of temperatures that should
approach/exceed daily record values.  Some of this heat will
extend into the northern Plains through Wednesday followed by a
moderating trend.  The upper ridge may weaken enough by Sunday to
bring temperatures below record levels, albeit still well above
normal.  In the Gulf of Mexico there is continued potential for a
disturbance to form near the Bay of Campeche and move northward
late in the week and weekend, but with a large degree of
uncertainty in its evolution.  The National Hurricane Center
continues to monitor this area in its outlooks.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Based on guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles, the updated forecast
started with an operational model blend of mostly the GFS/ECMWF
with a small minority weighting of the Canadian. Trended toward
more inclusion of continuity and the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF ensemble
means as uncertainty increased both over the Gulf and out of the
Pacific into the Northwest.

Within the initial East Coast trough there are still
low-predictability shortwave uncertainties that will take
additional time to resolve.  Some models hint at enough flow
separation to close off a small-scale upper low for a brief time
somewhat south of the main closed low forecast to track just north
of Maine.  Enough ensembles showed at least a weak wave along the
front to introduce one for the Wed prog near the Gulf of Maine. A
blend approach worked well to resolve detail spread for the
southern Canada/northern tier shortwave that ultimately settles
over eastern North America.

Guidance spread for North Pacific flow reaching western Canada and
the northwestern U.S. by late week/weekend is less dramatic than
it was 24 hours ago but some differences persist. The GFS runs
were generally slower than the ECMWF/Canadian and most of the
ensembles (GEFS+ECMWF+Canadian), which was reasonable given the
quicker flow across the N Pac. However, wavelength spacing could
be shorter than advertised by the quicker models as another
Pacific system may develop just of southwestern Alaska. For now,
preferred the ECMWF-led consensus.

Today's guidance still signals the potential for tropical
development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and track northward
over the Gulf of Mexico.  The prevailing trend over the past day
or more has been slower and in some cases westward.  Ensemble
means are still fairly ill-defined due to individual member spread
of a rather weak system.  Needless to say there is still
considerable uncertainty.  The updated manual forecast reflected
only a very slight westward nudge of the surface system that still
kept the area of low pressure just offshore Louisiana by next
Sunday per the 17Z NHC-WPC coordination call.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Ahead of the northern tier cold front on Wednesday, expect a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California into the
northern Plains.  Continued progression of the front east of the
Rockies will bring a pronounced cooling trend to the central U.S.
after Wednesday/Thursday.  The Southwest/California and the Great
Basin should maintain similar anomalies into the weekend with the
Northwest also rebounding to well above normal levels late in the
week.  The combination of an arriving Pacific front and gradual
weakening of the Four Corners ridge may finally start to reduce
the coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies by next Sunday.
Before then expect multiple days with numerous locations seeing
temperatures approach or exceed daily record highs/warm lows.  The
combination of extreme daily temperatures and duration, as well as
being rather early in the season for such an event, should make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.  Excessive heat
warnings are in place for many areas of the Southwest next week
where temperatures may climb well into the 110s in the lower
deserts with low temperatures only in the 80s and 90s. Coastal
locations in Southern California will likely be spared much of the
heat owing to cool ocean temperatures and enough onshore flow.

The upper trough near the East Coast should reach far enough
eastward to allow for a drier trend over the northern half of the
region mid-late week though shortwave energy/Atlantic surface
waviness could still produce a little rain near the southern
Mid-Atlantic.  At the same time somewhat more rain may fall over
Florida while a stalling/weakening front near the Gulf Coast may
help to focus diurnally-enhanced showers and thunderstorms.  Areas
near the Gulf Coast should continue to monitor forecasts/National
Hurricane Center discussions over the coming days for the latest
information regarding any potential tropical cyclone development
by the latter half of the week into the weekend.  Regardless of
the strength of any possible system, the northward flow of
tropical moisture would bring the threat of heavy rainfall to
portions of the southern tier.  The cold front pushing eastward
from the northern Plains will produce some rain and thunderstorms
from the Midwest eastward/southeastward into the eastern U.S.
Some of this activity could be locally heavy but it may take into
the short range time frame to determine any areas where it may be
relatively more likely.  Areas of rain may also be possible along
the stalling front back over the central Plains/Rockies but only
very isolated chances of rainfall over the Four Corners (likely
relegated to the terrain if anything).

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West and through midweek over the northern
Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California through the
end of the week...


...Overview...

A very strong upper ridge centered over the Four Corners states
will remain a dominant feature in the pattern through the period
but should gradually weaken and drift a bit southward by next
weekend.  Long-term mean troughing over eastern North America will
consist of a leading East Coast trough that departs after Thursday
followed by moderately amplifying energy over western-central
parts of southern Canada and northern tier U.S. (and possibly some
trailing flow from Canada).  This amplifying energy will push a
front across the northern half of the lower 48 through the period,
with the trailing part of the front likely stalling over the
central Plains/Rockies.  Pacific flow should bring another
shortwave/upper low and leading frontal system into western Canada
and northwestern U.S. next weekend.  The western upper ridge will
support a hazardous heat wave event over parts of the Interior
West/Rockies and extending into California during the latter half
of the week, with a broad area of temperatures that should
approach/exceed daily record values.  Some of this heat will
extend into the northern Plains through Wednesday followed by a
moderating trend.  The upper ridge may weaken enough by Sunday to
bring temperatures below record levels, albeit still well above
normal.  In the Gulf of Mexico there is continued potential for a
disturbance to form near the Bay of Campeche and move northward
late in the week and weekend, but with a large degree of
uncertainty in its evolution.  The National Hurricane Center
continues to monitor this area in its outlooks.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Based on guidance through the 00Z/06Z cycles, the updated forecast
started with an operational model blend of mostly the GFS/ECMWF
with a small minority weighting of the Canadian. Trended toward
more inclusion of continuity and the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF ensemble
means as uncertainty increased both over the Gulf and out of the
Pacific into the Northwest.

Within the initial East Coast trough there are still
low-predictability shortwave uncertainties that will take
additional time to resolve.  Some models hint at enough flow
separation to close off a small-scale upper low for a brief time
somewhat south of the main closed low forecast to track just north
of Maine.  Enough ensembles showed at least a weak wave along the
front to introduce one for the Wed prog near the Gulf of Maine. A
blend approach worked well to resolve detail spread for the
southern Canada/northern tier shortwave that ultimately settles
over eastern North America.

Guidance spread for North Pacific flow reaching western Canada and
the northwestern U.S. by late week/weekend is less dramatic than
it was 24 hours ago but some differences persist. The GFS runs
were generally slower than the ECMWF/Canadian and most of the
ensembles (GEFS+ECMWF+Canadian), which was reasonable given the
quicker flow across the N Pac. However, wavelength spacing could
be shorter than advertised by the quicker models as another
Pacific system may develop just of southwestern Alaska. For now,
preferred the ECMWF-led consensus.

Today's guidance still signals the potential for tropical
development to emerge from the Bay of Campeche and track northward
over the Gulf of Mexico.  The prevailing trend over the past day
or more has been slower and in some cases westward.  Ensemble
means are still fairly ill-defined due to individual member spread
of a rather weak system.  Needless to say there is still
considerable uncertainty.  The updated manual forecast reflected
only a very slight westward nudge of the surface system that still
kept the area of low pressure just offshore Louisiana by next
Sunday per the 17Z NHC-WPC coordination call.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Ahead of the northern tier cold front on Wednesday, expect a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California into the
northern Plains.  Continued progression of the front east of the
Rockies will bring a pronounced cooling trend to the central U.S.
after Wednesday/Thursday.  The Southwest/California and the Great
Basin should maintain similar anomalies into the weekend with the
Northwest also rebounding to well above normal levels late in the
week.  The combination of an arriving Pacific front and gradual
weakening of the Four Corners ridge may finally start to reduce
the coverage of plus 10F and greater anomalies by next Sunday.
Before then expect multiple days with numerous locations seeing
temperatures approach or exceed daily record highs/warm lows.  The
combination of extreme daily temperatures and duration, as well as
being rather early in the season for such an event, should make
this a dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.  Excessive heat

where temperatures may climb well into the 110s in the lower
deserts with low temperatures only in the 80s and 90s. Coastal

The upper trough near the East Coast should reach far enough

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun June 13 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEVADA AND FAR
WEST-CENTRAL UTAH...

The ongoing fire weather outlook for tomorrow (Monday) remains on
track.  Critical fire weather conditions are forecast for portions
of east-central Nevada and west-central Utah, where the overlap of
surface wind speeds over 20 mph and RH values below 10% are the most
likely to occur with receptive fuels (see previous discussion for
more details).  The only notable change to the fire weather outlook
was to delineate an area of isolated dry thunderstorms across the
mountains of central New Mexico (as discussed in the previous
outlook).  Confidence in thunderstorm coverage is sufficient across
the area to warrant a highlight given the favorable environment for
dry thunderstorms.  An additional favorable factor across southern
New Mexico is the enhanced northeasterly midlevel flow, which should
promote storm motions over 25 mph and limit the chance for wetting
rains.

..Jirak.. 06/13/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0211 AM CDT Sun Jun 13 2021/

...Synopsis...
South to southwesterly upper-level flow is expected to persist along
the West coast for the beginning of the work week. Although surface
pressure falls will be modest over the broader inter-mountain West,
strengthening mid-level flow coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing
and hot/dry conditions will support a fire weather threat for parts
of the Great Basin. Other localized threats may evolved across
coastal Southern California and central New Mexico.

...Great Basin...
Little to no moisture recovery is expected across the Great Basin
over the next 48 hours, which will yield another day of single digit
to low teen relative humidity values. Winds will increase to 15-25
mph across much of NV and western UT with a smaller corridor of
20-25 mph sustained winds likely within this area. Short and medium
range ensemble guidance show reasonably high probabilities for
critical wind/RH conditions, likely being driven by increasing flow
aloft amid deep boundary-layer mixing. Recent fire activity and
reports indicate fuels are receptive for most of NV and western UT,
and should remain receptive through early this week. Expansion of
the critical risk area is possible into parts of northwest UT if
fuels cure sufficiently by Monday afternoon.

...Southern California...
Northerly pressure-gradient winds are forecast to increase late
Monday night into early Tuesday along the southern CA coast as high
pressure builds to the north. Resulting Sundowner winds could lead
to areas of elevated fire weather conditions across Santa Barbra
county, though confidence in the wind and RH forecast is somewhat
low given the somewhat modest pressure gradient and marine moisture
currently in place.

...New Mexico...
Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop within the southern
Rockies Monday afternoon. Mid-level moisture atop a deep, dry
boundary layer may support a few dry lightning strikes. However, the
coverage of storms is expected to be somewhat low, and PWAT values
between 0.5 to 0.75 inches suggest a mixture of wet and dry
thunderstorms.

moisture streaming into the Central High Plains and a weak front
will trigger showers and thunderstorms over parts of the Central
Plains and Southern Plains.  The SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over the Central High Plains, Central Gulf
Coast, and parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic/Central Appalachians
through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. On Monday, showers and
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Northeast and along
the Gulf Coast into the Southeast. The same general areas will be
active on Tuesday as well.

Meanwhile, in the West, heat will build through Tuesday as an
upper-level ridge expands eastward over the Rockies and the
Southwest. Therefore, excessive Heat Watches and Warnings and Heat
Advisories are in place, especially from Monday onward for
portions of California, the Desert Southwest, and the Great Basin.
Hot temperatures in the 90s and even into the 100s will spread
eastward into the Northern High Plains into Tuesday. Record high
temperatures are expected to be widespread across the Desert
Southwest, Intermountain West, and the Rockies through Tuesday
evening. Given the heat, dry conditions, and gusty wind, an
Elevated Risk of fire danger is in place in the Great Basin for
the rest of Sunday into Monday morning, with a Critical Risk for
portions of Nevada and Utah on Monday. The Pacific Northwest and
Northern California will have light rain as a front over the
Pacific Northwest move slowly eastward to Great Basin/Northern
High Plains by Tuesday evening.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0111 AM CDT Mon Jun 14 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL NEVADA INTO WESTERN
UTAH...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist over the southern CONUS today as
mid and upper-level flow strengthen along the West Coast. Mostly
clear skies across the Southwest and Great Basin will promote near
record high temperatures and the diurnal deepening of a thermal
trough. Increasing winds in the vicinity of the trough axis, aided
by deep boundary-layer mixing and strong mid-level flow, will
introduce a robust fire weather threat to the Great Basin and
thunderstorm chances across parts of New Mexico and southeast
Arizona. The increasing pressure gradient across the West Coast may
also support fire weather concerns for parts of coastal southern
California where ERC values have been increasing.

...Great Basin...
Recent guidance continues to show high probability for a broad swath
of 15-25 mph sustained winds within the Great Basin this afternoon
as the surface trough deepens. 25-35 mph winds in the 750 to 650 mb
layer will likely manifest at the surface as frequent wind gusts
given deep boundary-layer mixing and a nearly uni-direction
low-level wind profile. Little to no moisture recovery over the next
24 hours will support another afternoon of single digit RH values.
Fuels across the region remain receptive after a day of hot, dry,
and windy conditions on Sunday, which will support widespread
elevated to critical fire weather conditions.

...New Mexico...
Regional 00Z soundings show mid-level moisture remains in place
across southern to central NM. Early morning surface observations
show dewpoints increasing over the past 4 hours across
southern/southwest NM, suggesting sufficient moisture to support
convection may reach as far west as southeast AZ. Despite the
increase in low-level moisture, very hot temperatures will drive
deep mixing with boundary-layer RH values near or below 20% while
supporting 100-500 J/kg MUCAPE. As such, isolated convection with
dry lightning appears possible this afternoon from southeast AZ into
central NM.

...Southern California...
Early morning surface observations show Sundowner winds increasing
to 30-40 mph across southern Santa Barbara county associated with a
-4 mb KSMX/KSBA pressure gradient. While winds may abate today, the
deepening of the surface trough across the southern CO River Valley
coupled with increasing pressure across northern CA will support
another night of similar (if not slightly stronger) gradient winds
late tonight into early Tuesday. Increasing temperatures over the
next 24 hours and downslope warming/drying will help reduce RH
values into the upper teens, which should support at least elevated
fire weather concerns (and potentially local critical conditions
where RH values are sufficiently low).

...Record to dangerous heat continuing through the week across
much of the Interior West...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest/California through the
end of the week...

...Heavy rainfall threat over parts of the South by the weekend...


...Overview...

During the course of the Thursday-Monday period most guidance
expects the large scale pattern to transition from a strong Four
Corners ridge and East Coast trough toward broadly cyclonic flow
across the northern half of the lower 48.  The ridge initially
over the West will support a hazardous heat wave over portions of
the region with a fairly broad area of temperatures
approaching/exceeding daily record values through the end of the
week.  Gradual weakening/suppression of the western ridge should
lead to some moderation of temperatures after Saturday even if
readings remain above normal.  Meanwhile precipitation east of the
Rockies should generally increase in coverage and intensity.  The
National Hurricane Center continues to monitor the potential for a
disturbance to develop over the western Gulf, with a general
consensus suggesting that this feature could track northward and
bring a heavy rainfall threat to parts of the South.  Farther
north a front that will progress eastward from the Plains/Upper
Midwest and then stall as it awaits trailing waviness reaching the
Northwest/Plains Saturday-Monday will be a focus for
showers/storms over multiple days.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

A general model consensus to start the period followed by a
gradual trend toward an even blend of the 18Z GFS/GEFS mean and
12Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean provided a reasonable starting point for
depicting the most common elements of guidance.  The GFS continues
to be a bit on the southern side of the spread for the front
progressing over areas east of the Rockies in response to
amplifying northern tier U.S./southern Canada flow.  However the
occasional tendency for convection to extend farther south and
east than model forecasts would argue for holding onto some GFS
concepts as part of a blend.  Guidance is still in the process of
figuring out the details of eastern Pacific into western North
America flow.  Over the past day the model consensus has trended
noticeably weaker with what energy reaches the northwestern
U.S./southwestern Canada late week into the weekend (a nod to
recent ensemble mean forecasts that have been fairly weak due to
member spread, and also plausible given initial progression of
northeastern Pacific flow).  Latest CMC runs provide an exception
in being stronger than other guidance with ridge that builds over
the East Pacific and deeper with its trough over the Northwest
during the latter half of the period.  By the start of next week
the surface pattern over the central U.S. will be sensitive to the
exact strength of the shortwave.  Models still suggest the initial
East Coast upper trough may separate/close off a low as it departs
but the effects should remain offshore.

Not a lot has changed over the past day with the forecast of
possible tropical development emerging from the Bay of Campeche
with a northward track over the western Gulf of Mexico.  The
guidance average for timing appears to have stabilized but there
is still a broad range of possible track/timing.  The CMC
maintains its multi-day trait of being on the fast side of the
envelope while UKMET runs are slowest.  Latest ensemble means are
on the western side of the spread but with a fair amount of spread
among individual members.  The manual forecast remains fairly
close to yesterday's 17Z NHC-WPC coordination with day 7 Monday
extrapolation leading to a position near the 18Z GFS.  While
confidence in the details is still quite uncertain, the overall
pattern does support an increasing potential for some heavy
rainfall to reach parts of the South by the weekend/early next
week.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect the most extreme temperatures over the West to continue
through Friday with a broad area of 10-20F above normal readings
that will approach or exceed daily record highs/warm lows over
much of the southern half of the region.  The combination of
extreme daily temperatures and duration, as well as being rather
early in the season for such an event, should make this a
dangerous heat wave for sensitive groups.  Excessive heat
warnings/watches are in place for many areas of the Southwest and
into the California Central Valley next week, with temperatures
climbing well into the 110s in the lower deserts with low
temperatures only in the 80s and 90s.  Coastal locations in
Southern California will likely be spared much of the heat owing
to cool ocean temperatures and enough onshore flow.  By
Sunday-Monday, the Southwest and most of California should
moderate somewhat as the Four Corners upper high weakens and
drifts southward.  Areas farther north may still see highs 10F or
more above normal.  The Central Plains region should experience
some of the heat on Thursday as well with highs 10-20F above
normal.  After Thursday the front over the central/eastern U.S.
will bring temperatures down toward normal with perhaps a few
pockets a little below normal depending on the day.  The East will
be on the cool side late this week before rebounding toward
normal, though clouds/rain reaching parts of the South may lead to
below-normal highs late in the period.

Areas near the Gulf Coast should continue to monitor
forecasts/National Hurricane Center discussions over the coming
days for the latest information regarding any potential tropical
cyclone development by the latter half of the week into the
weekend.  Regardless of the strength or precise track of any
possible system, the northward flow of tropical moisture would
bring the threat of heavy rainfall to portions of the southern
tier--which would be particularly troublesome over areas that have
received considerable rainfall over recent weeks.  The cold front
pushing eastward from the Plains/Upper Midwest will produce some
rain and thunderstorms from the Midwest eastward/southeastward
into the eastern U.S.  Some of this activity could be locally
heavy between the Upper Midwest and Ohio Valley and nearby areas
but it may take into the short range time frame to resolve heavy
rainfall potential more precisely.  Additional rainfall should
develop over the Plains/Midwest during the weekend and early next
week as waviness develops on the trailing part of the stalled
front.  Some scattered diurnal convection is possible over the
Four Corners, primarily confined to the terrain.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0203 AM CDT Mon Jun 14 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEVADA AND WESTERN UTAH...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, currently residing off the West Coast, is
forecast to translate across the Pacific Northwest through the day
Tuesday. Resulting surface pressure falls ahead of this wave will
help consolidate a surface low over the northern Rockies with a
trailing trough across the Great Basin. This will help strengthen
pressure-gradient winds again Tuesday afternoon across the broader
West, with the strongest winds expected over parts of the Great
Basin under a mid-level flow maximum. Building high pressure behind
the main synoptic wave will augment pressure-gradient winds across
parts of southern California, resulting in increased fire weather
concerns.

...Great Basin...
Little to no moisture recovery will yield another day of single
digit RH values across much of the Great Basin. Fuels are largely
receptive across most of the region, and may experience further
curing after Monday's hot/dry conditions. Surface winds are forecast
to increase through the day to 15-25 mph across a large swath of the
Great Basin and northern Rockies within the synoptic trough. A belt
of stronger mid-level flow is forecast to reside over the Great
Basin, which will likely mix down to the surface and support 25-35
mph wind gusts thanks to deep boundary-layer mixing. This corridor
will see the highest potential for sustained critical conditions
with elevated conditions likely as far north as north-central MT
(though fuels across central/northern MT may not be as receptive as
compared to locations farther south).

...Southern California...
Building high pressure over northern CA Tuesday will help drive a -4
to -5 mb KSMX/KSBA pressure gradient. Northerly Sundowner winds to
30-40 mph (and perhaps locally stronger) are expected Tuesday into
Tuesday night across the coastal foothills of Santa Barbara county.
Warm temperatures and downslope warming/drying will aid in RH
reductions into the teens, and perhaps single digits for a few
locations. With ERC values increasing due to limited rainfall in
recent weeks, elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
appear likely.

...Arizona into New Mexico...
Mid-level moisture is forecast to gradually shift west within the
weak easterly flow regime on the southern periphery of an
upper-level high over the Four Corners. Thermodynamic profiles are
forecast to be supportive of a few dry thunderstorms with deep
boundary-layer mixing and limited, but sufficient, instability.
Recent ensemble guidance has a stronger QPF signal compared to
previous days, indicating that at least a mixture of wet and dry
storms is possible. However, fuels across this area are receptive to
dry lightning strikes with several large fires noted across the
AZ/NM region.

In addition to the dry lightning threat, southeasterly winds will
likely increase to 15-20 mph by late afternoon across southeast
AZ/southwest NM as the southern extension of the main synoptic
trough diurnally deepens amid very warm temperatures. Relative
humidity values in the single digits to low teens are expected,
which will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Thunderstorms are possible in the East and could be severe in
the Mid-Atlantic region today...

...A heat wave in the western and central U.S. will be
record-breaking this workweek, and lead to fire danger...

Multiple weak fronts combining with moist air will lead to the
potential for thunderstorms in the East. An upper-level trough
pushing into the Great Lakes region will provide support for the
thunderstorms to possibly become severe in the Mid-Atlantic region
this afternoon into tonight. High winds are likely the main threat
as storms could congeal into a squall line, and the Storm
Prediction Center has delineated a Slight Risk of severe weather.
Isolated flash flooding could occur in portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast as well. Farther south, scattered
thunderstorms are possible in parts of the Gulf Coast states and
the Carolinas over the next couple of days. The Florida peninsula
in particular could see heavy downpours, which could lead to
isolated flash flooding--the urban areas of the Miami metro area
are of concern. Additionally, the High Plains should see another
day of isolated to scattered thunderstorms today into tonight. A
Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for west-central
Texas, while a Marginal Risk of severe weather is forecast for
northern/central portions of the High Plains.

Meanwhile, a strong upper-level ridge is in place across western
and central parts of the U.S., causing hot temperatures that will
continue for several days in some areas. Temperatures well into
the 110s are forecast for the next few days in the Desert
Southwest, and temperatures exceeding 100 as far north as Montana
especially tomorrow will be 25+ degrees above average. Dozens
(possibly hundreds) of daily record high maximum and minimum
temperatures are likely to be set over the next few days in
California, Intermountain West, Desert Southwest, Rockies, and
High Plains. Excessive Heat Warnings and Watches as well as Heat
Advisories are in effect. Given the heat, dry conditions, and
gusty winds, Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather are in
place across the Great Basin and portions of southern California
through at least Tuesday. The exception to the Western heat will
be in the Pacific Northwest, where a cold front is expected to
cause cooler temperatures and rain chances that could shift into
the Northern Great Basin as well by Tuesday.

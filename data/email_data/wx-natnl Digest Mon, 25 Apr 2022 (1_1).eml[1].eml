.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CDT Sun Apr 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough positioned over the northern Great Plains will
shift northeast throughout the day, entering portions of the
southern Canada and the Great Lakes region. A broad jet streak
situated along the southern periphery of this trough will shift east
as well and undergo a weakening trend. Consequently, mid-level flow
over the southern/central Plains will weaken throughout the day and
remain marginally enhanced. At the surface, a cold front will push
through the southern Plains and become somewhat diffuse. Generally
light surface winds will accompany the post-frontal airmass, along
with somewhat cool surface temperatures. These factors should result
in minimal fire-weather concerns for today.

...Overview...

For the latter half of this week, a surface low consolidating near
New England in conjunction with a slow-moving upper low will cause
precipitation chances to persist over the Northeast. Meanwhile,
mean troughing with multiple shortwaves is likely in the West, and
this trough axis should eventually track eastward by the end of
the week, pushing a broad upper ridge initially over the central
U.S. eastward. The trough will support formation of a central U.S.
surface low and possibly another round of snow in the northern
Rockies/High Plains on its backside, while rain is likely farther
south across the central Plains/Mississippi Valley. The details of
these threats remain quite uncertain at this point, however.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable with the pattern in the
eastern U.S. through the end of the week with the aforementioned
upper low tracking slowly from the Great Lakes to Northeast and
stalling/spinning, with an associated coastal surface low. There
is also reasonably good agreement for general broad ridging behind
in the central U.S., though with some uncertainty in embedded
shortwaves. But models are considerably more varied with their
handling of the western troughing, first with a shortwave/possibly
a compact upper low moving through southwestern to south-central
Canada Wednesday-Thursday and how and when the energy gets
absorbed, and then with the trough's track eastward around Friday
into the weekend. GFS runs had been on the faster side of
consensus through the 12Z run, but fortunately the 18Z GFS slowed
to be more in line with other guidance. However, even by Friday
there are still some differences, with the CMC and ECMWF showing
energy spilling into the Pacific Northwest to prompt the trough to
move around Friday, while the GFS is oriented more inland with the
energy and shows ridging across the Pacific Northwest. Differences
in energy there and elsewhere lead to considerable model and
ensemble member variability with timing of the trough movement
eastward as well as its extent southward, affecting the surface
low position as well. The newer 00Z guidance like the GFS and
ECMWF show a more northern track of the upper and surface lows
over the weekend compared to the 12/18Z cycle used for this
forecast, further indicating the uncertainty.

The WPC forecast was able to use a multi-model deterministic blend
favoring the ECMWF and GFS early in the period, but gradually
adding in GEFS and EC ensemble mean influence to about half by the
latter part of the period as uncertainty in any particular
solution increased. But ensemble mean guidance was certainly
flatter/less amplified than preferred given the ample differences
in the individual ensemble members in a pattern sensitive to
smaller scale shortwaves that may not be handled too well. Thus
future changes to the forecast especially by next weekend may be
considerable as guidance evolves over the next few days.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Individual
precipitation events should generally be light to moderate;
amounts will add up over time but still are not expected to be too
hazardous. Higher elevations of New England may see snow with the
precipitation activity. Some rain may begin in the central U.S. as
early as Wednesday near a warm front and surface low, but rain is
likely to increase in coverage and amounts as the week progresses
given better upper-level support and strengthening low pressure
that will eventually push eastward into the weekend. Unsettled
weather should also occur in the western to north-central U.S.,
with amounts increasing from Thursday into Friday and Saturday.
Conditions will likely be cold enough for snow in the northern
Rockies on the backside of the surface low, and there is once
again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading into the
northern High Plains as well. But the details of these threats may
not come into focus for a few more days given considerable model
uncertainty.

Cooler than average temperatures are forecast for the eastern
third of the U.S. Wednesday into Thursday, with the core of the
cold air in the Great Lakes/central Appalachians, with
temperatures 10-20F below normal and the possibility of a few
daily record lows on Wednesday. On the other hand warmer than
normal temperatures should spread from the Southwest/Four Corners
states into southern and central parts of the Plains underneath
upper ridging. By Friday into the weekend, the pattern should
generally shift to cooler than average temperatures in the North
and warmer than average in the South. The northern Plains to
Midwest are forecast to see highs nearing 20F below average, but
lows may be closer to normal. Meanwhile the southern tier should
be around 10F above average.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun April 24 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19600414 - 20010421 - 19940409 - 19910406 - 20040420


Analogs to the 7 day mean observed pattern centered 4 days ago (D-4)

...Overview...

Modest cyclogenesis near/east of New England midweek is forecast
to bring lingering mixed precipitation and gusty winds late this
week into next weekend for parts of the Northeast.  Meanwhile,
multiple shortwaves moving onshore into the Pacific Northwest will
likely push a broad trough through much of the western U.S. late
this week, reaching into the northern/central Plains by the
weekend where a low pressure system is forecast to form.  A broad
shield of precipitation ahead of this system is forecast to expand
across the midsection of the country into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys and then toward Appalachians by next weekend, although
details remain uncertain at this point.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system over the Canadian Maritimes through much of
the medium-range period after modest cyclogenesis is forecast to
occur near/east of New England on Wednesday.  There is also good
agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S., though with
uncertain details on embedded shortwaves.  In contrast, models
continue to indicate much uncertainty with multiple shortwaves
forecast to move onshore across the Pacific Northwest, leading to
diverging model solutions by next weekend as the system reaches
into the midsection of the country.  While there has been a wide
varieties of possible outcomes as shown by recent deterministic
model solutions, ensemble means have generally agreed to develop
and consolidate a broad low pressure system to be centered over
the central Plains on Saturday, and heading generally toward the
east or east-northeast, with a broad swath of precipitation ahead
of the entire system.  This multi-model/ensemble approach yielded
a solution that is quite compatible with the previous WPC
medium-range forecast package.  Toward the end of the forecast
period, the GFS and GEFS have generally slowed down the eastward
progression of the central U.S. system in better agreement with
the ECMWF and CMC means.  Therefore, a slower solution is
preferred.

The WPC medium-range morning package begins with a blend of 40%
from the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, 40% from the 06Z GFS/GEFS, and 20%
from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean, transitioning to a blend of 45% from
the 00Z EC/EC mean, 30% from the 06Z GEFS and 25% from the CMC
mean by Day 7.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area.  Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day.  Some rain may begin in the
central U.S. as early as Wednesday near a warm front and surface
low, but rain is likely to increase in coverage and amounts as the
week progresses as the main upper trough exits the Rockies and
consolidates a low pressure a low pressure system in the central
U.S. The entire system is forecast to push eastward toward the
eastern U.S. later next weekend.  Unsettled weather should also
occur in the western to north-central U.S., with amounts
increasing from Thursday into Friday and begins to lessen by next
weekend.  Conditions will likely be cold enough for snow in the
northern Rockies on the backside of the surface low, and there is
once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading into the
northern High Plains as well.  But the full details of these
threats may not realized for a few more days given the current
model uncertainty.

Cooler than average temperatures are in store for the eastern
third of the U.S. Wednesday into Thursday, with the core of the
cold air moving through the Great Lakes/central Appalachians,
where temperatures 10-20F below normal will make for the
possibility of a few daily record lows on Wednesday.  On the other
hand warmer than normal temperatures should spread from the
Southwest/Four Corners states into southern and central parts of
the Plains underneath upper ridging.  By Friday into the weekend,
the pattern should generally shift to cooler than average
temperatures in the North and warmer than average in the South.
The northern Plains to Midwest are forecast to see highs nearing
20F below average, but lows may be closer to normal.  Meanwhile,
the southern tier should be around 10F above average.

...Overview...

Modest cyclogenesis near/east of New England midweek is forecast
to bring lingering mixed precipitation and gusty winds late this
week into next weekend for parts of the Northeast.  Meanwhile,
multiple shortwaves moving onshore into the Pacific Northwest will
likely push a broad trough through much of the western U.S. late
this week, reaching into the northern/central Plains by the
weekend where a low pressure system is forecast to form.  A broad
shield of precipitation ahead of this system is forecast to expand
across the midsection of the country into the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys and then toward Appalachians by next weekend, although

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer trough positioned over the Great Lakes region will
remain quasi-stationary throughout the day. Meanwhile, a mid-level
trough will enter portions of the Pacific Northwest, while a ridge
builds over the central/northern Rockies. Mid-level flow within
these systems is forecast to remain rather marginal, with a few
transient pockets of enhanced flow developing. At the surface, a
cold front will continue moving through the southern Plains, with
cool temperatures and light winds occurring throughout the
post-frontal dry airmass, resulting in limited fire-weather concerns
on Monday.

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley through Monday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley and over parts of the Southern
Plains...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 30 degrees below average over parts
of the Upper Midwest...

On Sunday, a strong storm over the Southwestern Ontario, Canada
will move northeastward farther into Canada through Tuesday
evening. The associated front will destabilize the atmosphere from
the Great Lakes to the Southern Plains. Therefore, the SPC has
issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the
Great Lakes/Western Ohio Valley, and two smaller regions over the
Southern Plains through Monday morning. The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. However, there
is an increased risk for large hail, two inches or greater over
parts of southwestern Texas.

The showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain along the
associated front on Sunday. Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms along
the front through Monday morning over parts of the Southern Plains
and Lower Mississippi Valley. The associated heavy rain will
create numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams
may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers.

In contrast, the low and high pressure in Canada will funnel cold
air over the Upper Midwest producing temperatures 10 to 30 degrees
below average. The temperatures will begin to moderate late Monday
into Tuesday. Along with the cold, snow will continue over parts
of the Upper Midwest through Monday morning. Then, light snow
lingers over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great
Lakes through Tuesday evening.

On Monday, the showers and thunderstorms will move eastward from
the Lower Great Lakes to the Southern Plains and Western/Central
Gulf Coast, as the severe thunderstorm threat decreases to a
Marginal Rick along the front. In addition, the excessive rainfall
threat reduces to a Marginal Risk over parts of eastern/southern
Texas into the Lower Mississippi Valley.

Meanwhile, upper-level energy moving over the Central/Southern
Rockies will produce snow over parts of the Central/Southern
Rockies through Monday afternoon.

Furthermore, a front will move onshore over the Pacific Northwest
overnight Sunday and move inland to the Northern Rockies/Great
Basin by Tuesday afternoon. The system will produce rain and the
highest elevation snow over parts of the Northwest, with rain
extending into the Northern Rockies for Monday into Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1221 AM CDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected to be low today across the CONUS.
A surface cold front will continue to shift east/southeast across
the upper OH river valley and towards the northwest Gulf Coast
today. Behind this front, cooler temperatures will continue to
overspread the southern Plains and the mid-MS river valley. To the
west across the High Plains, surface high pressure will continue to
build in the wake of the mid-level trough currently passing over the
central Rockies per early-morning water vapor imagery. This surface
regime will place the strongest pressure-gradient winds over the
upper MS river valley and generally away from the southern to
central High Plains where RH values below 15% are expected and fuels
are most receptive. Localized elevated concerns are possible across
parts of central NE and southwest OK where 10-15 mph winds may
overlap with RH values between 20-25%, but the potential for
persistent, widespread elevated conditions appears low.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0122 AM CDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase on Tuesday for portions of the
southern to central High Plains as a dry return flow regime becomes
established. Zonal flow is expected to increase over the central
Rockies through the day Tuesday, resulting in a deepening lee trough
across the central High Plains. Despite strengthening southerly
flow, moisture return is expected to be minimal after Monday's
frontal intrusion to the northwestern Gulf Coast. Consequently,
dry/windy conditions are expected that will support increasing fire
weather concerns across the Plains.

...Southern to Central High Plains...
Upper-level ridging will likely yield mostly clear skies across the
Plains on Tuesday. The diurnal warming of an antecedent dry air mass
will support deep boundary-layer mixing and widespread RH reductions
to 20-25% by mid to late afternoon. Sustained pressure-gradient
winds near 20 mph will likely see frequent gusts to 25-35 mph from
west TX into southern NE. Ensemble consensus suggests that a broad
swath of elevated conditions is likely, but drier members hint that
critical conditions are possible across northeast NM and the OK/TX
Panhandles into western KS where RH may fall below 15%. Regardless,
fire weather concerns are expected given receptive fuels (ERC values
above the 90th percentile) across most of the region. A Critical
risk area and an expansion of the Elevated risk may be warranted if
guidance continues to trend towards the drier solutions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Mon Apr 25 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 28 2022 - 12Z Mon May 02 2022

...Overview...

A mean trough axis initially near the West Coast as the medium
range period begins Thursday will push eastward through the rest
of this week, potentially forming a closed upper low over the
north-central U.S. over the weekend. A surface low is likely to
consolidate in conjunction with the trough/low, spreading rain to
much of the central U.S. while snow is forecast on the backside of
the low across the northern Rockies with some chance of wintry
weather spreading into the northern High Plains as well, although
the details of precipitation amounts and placement remain
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will
move slowly away from the Northeast over the weekend after
spreading some light to moderate rain and snow across the area for
the latter part of the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system (both in the upper levels and at the surface)
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. There is also
good agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S. Thursday
narrowing and becoming suppressed Friday into the weekend as
western troughing comes in, though with various details on
embedded shortwaves tracking through the overall ridge pattern.
The more uncertain part of the forecast lies in the upper trough
over the western U.S. Thursday pushing eastward with time. Recent
model guidance is in somewhat better agreement than a day or so
ago though, with a general consensus for shortwave energy to
consolidate within the trough and form an upper low by the weekend
in the north-central CONUS. There are still some differences
particularly with the latitudinal position of the upper low. With
the 12/18Z cycle, it appeared the the 12Z GFS was a bit south of
consensus by around Saturday so preferred the 18Z GFS instead that
was better clustered, but some newer 00Z guidance (particularly
the CMC) came in farther south. Similar north-south spread was
seen with the surface low positions through the weekend, with even
more divergence in position by Monday depending on how the upper
low may lift and/or weaken. Upstream of these features, models are
even less agreeable with the pattern--the ECMWF and CMC runs have
shown a strong shortwave somewhere in the Northwest by early
Sunday whereas GFS runs have been weaker with that energy, and the
ECMWF/CMC are also quite strong with possibly a larger closed low
in the eastern Pacific by Monday with the GFS runs showing a
different pattern.


The WPC forecast was based on a multi-model blend of deterministic
12/18Z guidance favoring the ECMWF early in the period, gradually
transitioning to a blend including the ensemble means
(particularly the EC mean) as spread and uncertainty increased
considerably. The results were pretty similar to the previous
forecast through Sunday.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day. Some rain is likely in the
central U.S. on Thursday, which should increase in coverage and
amounts Friday over northern/central parts of the Plains as the
main upper trough exits the Rockies and consolidates a low
pressure system in the central U.S. Conditions will likely be cold
enough for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the
surface low, and there is once again some threat of wintry
precipitation spreading into the northern High Plains as well. In
portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow. However, the exact
details of these threats may not be determined for a few more days
given continued model uncertainty. By the weekend, the current
expectation is that rain will spread into the East and could
linger over the southern Plains as the front there may stall.

The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. can expect cooler than
normal temperatures by around 10-15 degrees on Thursday with a few
daily record lows possible, but temperatures there should
gradually moderate closer to normal by the weekend and early next
week. But below average temperatures especially in terms of highs
will be reinforced with the incoming trough/low across the
north-central U.S, with highs potentially around 15-25F below
normal through much of the medium range period. Meanwhile the Four
Corners states to the central/southern High Plains will see warmer
than normal temperatures especially Thursday and Friday before the
upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed over the weekend.
Slightly above normal temperatures should then stretch across much
of the southern tier.

...Overview...

A mean trough axis initially near the West Coast as the medium
range period begins Thursday will push eastward through the rest
of this week, potentially forming a closed upper low over the
north-central U.S. over the weekend. A surface low is likely to
consolidate in conjunction with the trough/low, spreading rain to
much of the central U.S. while snow is forecast on the backside of
the low across the northern Rockies with some chance of wintry
weather spreading into the northern High Plains as well, although
the details of precipitation amounts and placement remain
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will
move slowly away from the Northeast over the weekend after
spreading some light to moderate rain and snow across the area for
the latter part of the week.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a slow-moving
low pressure system (both in the upper levels and at the surface)
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. There is also
good agreement on the broad ridge over the central U.S. Thursday
narrowing and becoming suppressed Friday into the weekend as
western troughing comes in, though with various details on
embedded shortwaves tracking through the overall ridge pattern.
The more uncertain part of the forecast lies in the upper trough
over the western U.S. Thursday pushing eastward with time. Recent
model guidance is in somewhat better agreement than a day or so
ago though, with a general consensus for shortwave energy to
consolidate within the trough and form an upper low by the weekend
in the north-central CONUS. There are still some differences
particularly with the latitudinal position of the upper low. With
the 12/18Z cycle, it appeared the the 12Z GFS was a bit south of
consensus by around Saturday so preferred the 18Z GFS instead that
was better clustered, but some newer 00Z guidance (particularly
the CMC) came in farther south. Similar north-south spread was
seen with the surface low positions through the weekend, with even
more divergence in position by Monday depending on how the upper
low may lift and/or weaken. Upstream of these features, models are
even less agreeable with the pattern--the ECMWF and CMC runs have
shown a strong shortwave somewhere in the Northwest by early
Sunday whereas GFS runs have been weaker with that energy, and the
ECMWF/CMC are also quite strong with possibly a larger closed low
in the eastern Pacific by Monday with the GFS runs showing a
different pattern.

The WPC forecast was based on a multi-model blend of deterministic
12/18Z guidance favoring the ECMWF early in the period, gradually
transitioning to a blend including the ensemble means
(particularly the EC mean) as spread and uncertainty increased
considerably. The results were pretty similar to the previous
forecast through Sunday.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The northeastern U.S. could receive multiple rounds of
precipitation through much of the week as the upper level and
surface lows pivot and linger over the area. Periods of
precipitation should generally be light to moderate; amounts will
add up over time but still are not expected to be too hazardous.
Higher elevations of New England may see snow during the night but
mixing with rain during the day. Some rain is likely in the
central U.S. on Thursday, which should increase in coverage and
amounts Friday over northern/central parts of the Plains as the
main upper trough exits the Rockies and consolidates a low
pressure system in the central U.S. Conditions will likely be cold
enough for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the
surface low, and there is once again some threat of wintry
precipitation spreading into the northern High Plains as well. In
portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin as rain and
transition to mixed precipitation or snow. However, the exact
details of these threats may not be determined for a few more days
given continued model uncertainty. By the weekend, the current
expectation is that rain will spread into the East and could
linger over the southern Plains as the front there may stall.

The northeastern quadrant of the U.S. can expect cooler than
normal temperatures by around 10-15 degrees on Thursday with a few
daily record lows possible, but temperatures there should
gradually moderate closer to normal by the weekend and early next
week. But below average temperatures especially in terms of highs
will be reinforced with the incoming trough/low across the
north-central U.S., with highs potentially around 15-25F below
normal through much of the medium range period. Meanwhile the Four
Corners states to the central/southern High Plains will see warmer
than normal temperatures especially Thursday and Friday before the
upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed over the weekend.
Slightly above normal temperatures should then stretch across much
of the southern tier.

...Isolated flash floods possible across parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and southern/eastern Texas today...

...A Marginal Risk of severe weather extends along a cold front
from the Lower Great Lakes to South Texas through tonight before
shifting towards the southern Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday...

...Well below average temperatures forecast across the northern
Plains, Upper Midwest and Great Lakes through midweek...

The final Monday of the month will feature shower and thunderstorm
chances stretching along a cold front that reaches from the Lower
Great Lakes to South Texas. There is the potential for repeating
rounds of heavy rain to impact areas between the Lower Mississippi
Valley and southern Texas. This may lead to isolated chances for
flash flooding, particularly throughout flood prone regions, as
the bulk of the heavy rain is expected to fall over regions
experiencing severe to exceptional drought. A Marginal Risk (level
1/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued and extends from
western Mississippi to South Texas. Additionally, a Marginal Risk
(level 1/5) of severe weather is in effect from western New York
to southern Texas as thunderstorms forming along the cold front
could produce occasional damaging wind gusts and some hail. By
Tuesday, the cold front will gradually shift south and east toward
the East Coast and northern Gulf of Mexico. The threat for
isolated flash floods will remain across South Texas, with a few
severe thunderstorms possible throughout the southern Mid-Atlantic.

Elsewhere, a frontal system entering the Pacific Northwest will
spread mostly light precipitation into the northern Great Basin
through late Tuesday. Rain and snow showers will also likely
spread across northern New England by Wednesday as a coastal storm
begins to develop near the Gulf of Maine. Scattered lake effect
snow showers will be found throughout the Great Lakes region on
Tuesday and Wednesday while persistent northwesterly winds usher
in well below average temperatures.

Speaking of below average temperatures, highs today are forecast
to be nearly 30 degrees below average throughout the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. This equates to temperatures struggling
to reach out of the 30s and 40s, with lows in the teens and 20s.
Winter-like temperatures will persist through Wednesday and spread
farther into the Midwest and Northeast, albeit not as anomalous. A
few daily record lows could be tied or broken in the Midwest and
Great Lakes, with the cold temperatures potentially leading to
frost/freeze concerns for sensitive vegetation. On the other end
of the spectrum, above average temperatures are again forecast
across the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Interior Northeast today
ahead of the advancing cold front. For the Desert Southwest, an
upper-level ridge will continue to lead to an early taste of
spring as high soar into the 90s. Warm temperatures will also
quickly return to the central Plains by midweek.

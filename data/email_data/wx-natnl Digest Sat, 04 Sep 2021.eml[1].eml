Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1135 AM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 031700Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with no changes. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions and the risk for a few dry
lightning strikes will continue across portions of the
northern/central Rockies. See the previous discussion for more
details.

..Lyons.. 09/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0126 AM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure is expected to build into the Northwest, as a
mid-level trough ejects into the northern Plains from the northern
Rockies today. With the passing of the upper trough, modest
boundary-layer mixing will promote locally Elevated surface winds/RH
across portions of the northern Rockies, especially in
terrain-favoring areas such as the Snake River Plain in Idaho and
Great Divide Basin in Wyoming. Deep-layer ascent associated with the
upper trough will promote fast-moving, relatively high-based
thunderstorm development across portions of central Wyoming during
afternoon, where a dry strike or two will also be possible. However,
the overall coverage of favorable surface winds/RH or dry lightning
is expected to be too sparse to support fire weather highlights at
this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 PM EDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 06 2021 - 12Z Fri Sep 10 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing in the Northeast on Monday will lift out by
Tuesday but will be quickly replaced by incoming troughing from
southern Canada. That trough should exit the East Coast around the
end of next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly
direction out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet
and drier than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles continue to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the Pacific/Alaska region which
translates into the West days 6-7. The 00z ECMWF has backed off on
amplification of a shortwave nearing the coast, while the GFS
remains more amplified. The CMC would also suggest troughing along
the coast on Day 7, and that's consistent with the ensemble means
as well. Enough run to run inconsistencies though in all the
models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the ensemble
means, with smaller contributions from the deterministics just for
a little added system definition.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. GFS/GEFS solutions remain a bit wetter than
the ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles. Favored a slightly drier
scenario for now. In the Gulf, some of the deterministic models
may be a little bit more robust on potential tropical activity,
but the ensemble solutions continue to exhibit a wide array of
spread. Large uncertainties remain regarding timing and potential
impacts to the Gulf Coast late week (if any), so prefer a more
modest approach at this time.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes Monday in
advance of a system out of the northern Plains, which may promote
some moderate to locally heavy rainfall on Tuesday-Wednesday
across Michigan and parts of the Lower Great Lakes. Rainfall along
the cold front may be lighter and continued southward into the
Southeast in a warmer and more humid environment. Increased
tropical moisture into the Gulf by mid to late week may bring the
threat for moderate to heavy rainfall along the central Gulf Coast
region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations and timing. Temperatures will be near to
above normal over most areas, especially the West to the Northern
Rockies ahead of the incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15
degrees above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into
the southern/central Plains late next week. Temperatures in the
Northeast will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally
northwest flow.

155 PM EDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Sep 06 2021 - 12Z Fri Sep 10 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing in the Northeast on Monday will lift out by
Tuesday but will be quickly replaced by incoming troughing from
southern Canada. That trough should exit the East Coast around the
end of next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly
direction out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet
and drier than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles continue to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the Pacific/Alaska region which
translates into the West days 6-7. The 00z ECMWF has backed off on
amplification of a shortwave nearing the coast, while the GFS
remains more amplified. The CMC would also suggest troughing along
the coast on Day 7, and that's consistent with the ensemble means
as well. Enough run to run inconsistencies though in all the
models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the ensemble
means, with smaller contributions from the deterministics just for
a little added system definition.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. GFS/GEFS solutions remain a bit wetter than
the ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles. Favored a slightly drier
scenario for now. In the Gulf, some of the deterministic models
may be a little bit more robust on potential tropical activity,
but the ensemble solutions continue to exhibit a wide array of
spread. Large uncertainties remain regarding timing and potential
impacts to the Gulf Coast late week (if any), so prefer a more
modest approach at this time.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes Monday in
advance of a system out of the northern Plains, which may promote
some moderate to locally heavy rainfall on Tuesday-Wednesday
across Michigan and parts of the Lower Great Lakes. Rainfall along
the cold front may be lighter and continued southward into the
Southeast in a warmer and more humid environment. Increased
tropical moisture into the Gulf by mid to late week may bring the
threat for moderate to heavy rainfall along the central Gulf Coast
region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations and timing. Temperatures will be near to
above normal over most areas, especially the West to the Northern
Rockies ahead of the incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15
degrees above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into
the southern/central Plains late next week. Temperatures in the
Northeast will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally
northwest flow.

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 11 - FRIDAY SEPTEMBER 17: The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles depict anomalous subtropical ridging over the interior
western CONUS late in week-1, shifting east toward the central CONUS early =
in
week-2. The ECMWF and Canadian ensembles weaken the ridge as it shifts east=
,
but the GEFS maintains a more amplified ridge through the middle of week-2.=
 A
late summer heat wave is predicted to be ongoing at the start of week-2 acr=
oss
portions of the western and central CONUS. The more amplified GEFS depicts
increased coverage of anomalous warmth compared to the ECMWF ensemble, with
positive maximum temperature anomalies greater than 10 deg F indicated over
portions of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. However, this would on=
ly
translate into temperatures in the 80s and 90s deg F, and not enough to
warrant
an excessive heat risk for most of these areas. However, increased southerl=
y
moisture flow forecast across the Lower Mississippi Valley, Southern Great
Plains, and the Lower Rio Grande Valley, combined with relatively warmer
temperatures compared to farther north, may result in heat index values
greater
than 105 deg F, where a slight risk for excessive heat is highlighted from =
Sep
11 to Sep 13. This is supported by the consolidated heat risk tool, which
indicates probabilities of at least 40% for reaching this threshold over pa=
rts
of the highlighted region. Cooling resources may be limited across portions=
 of
the Lower Mississippi Valley due to ongoing widespread power outages in the
wake of Hurricane Ida. This may lead to increased risk for heat related hea=
lth
impacts across the region. Later in week-2, anomalous warmth may shift towa=
rd
the eastern CONUS, although there are no indications that hazards criteria
will
be met given that it is becoming more difficult to reach hazards thresholds=
 as
the start of autumn approaches.



Increased southerly flow forecast along the western and central Gulf of Mex=
ico
Coast favors elevated chances for heavy rain across portions of the Souther=
n
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley early in week-2. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs 0z ECMWF
ensemble
has trended wetter across the region, and aligns more with the 0z Canadian
ensemble. The deterministic solutions of the ECMWF and Canadian models also
indicate the potential for tropical development in the western Gulf during =
the
period. The GEFS favors a relatively drier solution, likely a result of the
more amplified ridge depicted over the central CONUS. However, given curren=
t
trends in the ECMWF, the slight risk for heavy rain remains in place across
southeastern Texas for Sep 11 through Sep 13, and is expanded to include
southern Louisiana given the greater sensitivity to additional rainfall in =
the
wake of Hurricane Ida. Both the ECMWF reforecast tool and the uncalibrated =
0z
ECMWF ensemble depict these areas having at least a 20% chance for 3-day
precipitation totals exceeding 1-inch supportive of this slight risk area.



Moderate to major river flooding is ongoing across portions of the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Northeast due to heavy rainfall caused by the remnan=
ts
of Hurricane Ida. However, since most river levels are expected to subside
into
the minor flood stage or lower across these areas by the beginning of week-=
2,
a
flooding hazard is not depicted on the map. Please refer to local NWS offic=
es
for the latest flooding updates.



Multiple large wildfires continue to burn throughout the West, threatening
life
and property along with reducing air quality over a widespread area. The
Caldor
Fire in the Lake Tahoe basin of northern California has burned over 210,000
acres and is only 29% contained. Upstream of the ridge forecast over the
central CONUS, a mid-level trough is forecast to build into the western U.S=
.,
leading to an increasing chance of gusty winds which would promote further
spread of ongoing wildfires. The 0z GEFS continues to depict a more amplifi=
ed
trough over the region compared to the weaker troughing indicated in the 0z
ECMWF and Canadian ensembles. Despite these model differences, both the GEF=
S
and ECMWF reforecast tools depict probabilities greater than 20% for wind
speeds exceeding the 85th climatological percentile across parts of Califor=
nia
and adjacent areas of the Great Basin. Therefore, the slight risk for high
wind
speeds remains posted from Sep 11 through Sep 13 for parts of these regions=
,
including the Caldor/Lake Tahoe areas.



Anomalous troughing and associated surface low pressure development are
forecast across the Bering Sea during week-2 favoring increased chances of
unsettled weather across southern parts of Alaska. The 0z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensembles are in good agreement regarding this pattern, with a
gradual
eastward shift of the trough axis throughout the period. This favors increa=
sed
chances for high wind speeds, mainly over the Aleutians and extreme
southwestern Mainland early in the period, and then shifting eastward to th=
e
southern Mainland Coast and the Alaska Panhandle later in week-2 as the tro=
ugh
progresses eastward. A slight risk of high wind speeds is now highlighted
across all of these areas for the entire week-2 period, and is generally
supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool, which depicts probabilities greater
than 20% for wind speeds exceeding the 85th climatological percentile. The
synoptic pattern depicted in the dynamical models, which shows a tight
pressure
gradient between the surface low pressure forecast across the Alaska Region
and
surface high pressure predicted over the East Pacific, further justifies th=
e
slight risk for high winds. The enhanced southwesterly flow also favors
increasing precipitation chances across southern Alaska. Both the ECMWF and
GEFS reforecast tools depict probabilities of at least 20% for 3-day
precipitation exceeding 2-inches across coastal portions of the southern
Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, increasing to 30-40% later in the period=
.
This supports the addition of a slight risk of heavy precipitation over the=
se
areas for all of week-2.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Northern High Plains...
Lingering mid-level flow behind a shortwave trough ejecting out of
the northern Rockies will support west/northwesterly surface winds
near 15 mph across much of Montana and the western Dakotas. With
downslope trajectories supporting surface drying, pockets of
humidity less than 30% appear poised to develop through the
afternoon. Fuels are not overly favorable for fire spread but,
locally elevated conditions may develop for a few hours where gusty
winds, dry surface conditions, and drier fuels coexist.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with no changes. See
the previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 09/03/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Fri Sep 03 2021/

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure will continue to intensify as upper ridging
builds across the western CONUS through the period
tomorrow/Saturday. However, 30-50 kts of mid-level flow is expected
to pivot around the periphery of the upper ridge. With adequate
boundary-layer mixing beneath this stronger flow aloft, locally
Elevated surface winds/RH are expected to overlap in
terrain-favoring areas from the higher terrain of the Cascades to
the Yellowstone River Valley in Montana/Great Divide Basin in
Wyoming. The patchy, brief nature of the Elevated conditions
precludes any highlights this outlook.

...Labor Day Weekend to feature stormy weather across the nation's
mid-section but mostly tranquil conditions for much of the West
and East Coasts...

...Seasonally cooler temperatures to stick around in the Central
Plains, Ohio Valley, and Northeast; hottest conditions in the
South-Central U.S., growing increasingly hot throughout the West...

...Occasional showers and storms in parts of the Southeast,
Southwest, and Great Lakes; wildfires and plumes of smoke continue
to affect air quality levels in the West...

Labor Day Weekend can be best summarized as Mother Nature not
having the weekend off in parts of the Heartland, but taking a
weekend getaway trip to the East or West Coasts where drier
conditions are expected. The primary weather maker is a wave of
low pressure and its associated cold front tracking through the
central Plains and into the mid-Mississippi Valley on Saturday.
The cold front will act as a trigger to produce scattered showers
and thunderstorms tonight and into Saturday. Some of these storms
will contain heavy downpours and may even lead to areas of flash
flooding. As a result, Slight Risks for Excessive Rainfall have
been posted for southern Kansas and central Missouri today,
followed up with another Slight Risk areas from northern Oklahoma
on east to the Mississippi-Ohio River confluence. The front
marches east on Sunday ushering its swath of scattered showers and
storms into the Ohio Valley, Great Lakes, and both the northern
and central Appalachians. Expect hit-or-miss showers and storms to
flare up Sunday afternoon in the southern High Plains and into the
Lower Mississippi Valley.

Temperature-wise, the hottest and most summer-like temperature
regimes will be found in the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi
Valley. Daytime highs both Saturday and Sunday should reach the
mid-upper 90s with heat indices as high as 110 degrees. The
aforementioned cold front should bring some cooler conditions to
Oklahoma and northern Arkansas by Sunday, but south Texas and the
rest of the Deep South look to remain sultry. Out west,
temperatures return to above normal levels up and down the West
Coast on Saturday and only get hotter as Labor Weekend progresses.
The Great Valley of California may see highs reach the century
mark in spots by Sunday. The coolest weather is set to be on the
north-side of the cold front in the Central Plains where high
temps will struggle to get out of the 70s (roughly 10-15 degrees
below normal). The Northeast looks to remain on the seasonally
cool side each day this weekend, but rising dew points will make a
slightly more humid day on Sunday. Summer-like temperatures are
anticipated in the Southeast with the whole region (excluding
Florida) having a good chance to be mostly dry heading into Labor
Day.

Elsewhere, a quasi-stationary front will make its elf at home near
the northern Gulf Coast and over central Florida. This means daily
rounds of pop-up showers and storms each afternoon, some of which
could contains heavy downpours in these areas. Farther west,
unsettled weather is also on tap for parts of the Southwest where
atmospheric moisture content remains elevated. There is even a
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall in parts of southeast New
Mexico this evening. Look for scattered showers and storms to be a
common occurrence in southern New Mexico and into the Texas
Panhandle this weekend. Lastly, Air Quality Alerts remain in
effect across parts of the Pacific Northwest and California due to
ongoing bouts with smoke from ongoing wildfires.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri September 03 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 09 - 13 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a strong mean trou=
gh
to the west of Alaska over the Bering Sea. A trough over the eastern North
Pacific is predicted to progress eastward to the Pacific Coast of the CONUS=
. A
mean ridge and above normal mid-level heights are predicted over the centra=
l
CONUS, while a mean trough and below normal mid-level heights are predicted
over the eastern CONUS.

Above-normal temperature probabilities are elevated across Alaska in
association with above-normal 500-hPa heights. Above-normal temperatures ar=
e
favored for most of the CONUS due to predicted 500-hPa ridging and above-
normal
heights. A predicted trough over the northerneastern CONUS favors enhanced
probabilities of near to above-normal temperatures over parts of the Northe=
ast
ahead of the mean trough.

Above-normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over much of
southwestern
Mainland Alaska and the eastern Aleutians due to forecasted westerly surfac=
e
flow and storm system development. Near and below-normal precipitation chan=
ces
are increased over parts of northeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle in association with above-normal mid-level heights. The short wav=
e
trough forecast over the Pacific Coast supports an increased likelihood of
near
to above-normal precipitation for most of the western CONUS and parts of th=
e
Northern Plains. Near to below-normal precipitation probabilities are enhan=
ced
over much of the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS, consistent with the ERF
consolidation forecast tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation forecasts, offset by some
differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 11 - 17 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Me=
an
troughing is forecast to shift eastward over the Pacific Coast and a ridge =
is
forecast over the central and eastern CONUS with a trough moving into the
Atlantic.

500-hPa troughing forecast to the west of Alaska, favoring near to above-
normal
temperatures for northern Mainland Alaska and parts of Aleutians. Below-nor=
mal
temperatures are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle and parts of the Pacifi=
c
Northwest associated with the eastward progression of troughing and potenti=
al
cloudiness. Near to above-normal temperatures are also favored across the
remainder of the CONUS, consistent with the consolidation tool.

Troughing over the Bering Sea and Mainland Alaska increases the chances of
above-normal precipitation over much of Mainland Alaska, the Aleutians, and
Panhandle. A mean frontal boundary and potential tropical moisture lead to
enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the Central
Rockies
northeastward into parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains,
extending
to the Great Lakes. Above-normal precipitation is favored over the western
Gulf
Coast, related to potential tropical system development. Below-normal
precipitation is likely across the Southern Great Plains and the eastern
CONUS,
consistent with the consolidation tool.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing in the Northeast on Monday will lift out by
Tuesday but will be quickly replaced by incoming troughing from
southern Canada. That trough should exit the East Coast around the
end of next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly
direction out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet
and drier than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00z/06Z cycle, the models and ensembles continue to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the Pacific/Alaska region which
translates into the West days 6-7. The 00z ECMWF has backed off on
amplification of a shortwave nearing the coast, while the GFS
remains more amplified. The CMC would also suggest troughing along
the coast on Day 7, and that's consistent with the ensemble means
as well. Enough run to run inconsistencies though in all the
models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the ensemble
means, with smaller contributions from the deterministics just for
a little added system definition.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. GFS/GEFS solutions remain a bit wetter than
the ECMWF/Canadian and their ensembles. Favored a slightly drier
scenario for now. In the Gulf, some of the deterministic models
may be a little bit more robust on potential tropical activity,
but the ensemble solutions continue to exhibit a wide array of
spread. Large uncertainties remain regarding timing and potential
impacts to the Gulf Coast late week (if any), so prefer a more
modest approach at this time.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes Monday in
advance of a system out of the northern Plains, which may promote
some moderate to locally heavy rainfall on Tuesday-Wednesday
across Michigan and parts of the Lower Great Lakes. Rainfall along
the cold front may be lighter and continued southward into the
Southeast in a warmer and more humid environment. Increased
tropical moisture into the Gulf by mid to late week may bring the
threat for moderate to heavy rainfall along the central Gulf Coast
region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations and timing. Temperatures will be near to
above normal over most areas, especially the West to the Northern
Rockies ahead of the incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15
degrees above normal are possible as the area of warmth moves into
the southern/central Plains late next week. Temperatures in the
Northeast will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally
northwest flow.

Hazards:
- Flooding possible across portions of the Northeast.
- Flooding occurring or imminent across portions of the the Lower
Mississippi Valley and the
Mid-Atlantic.
- Flooding likely across portions of the Upper Mississippi Valley.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0119 AM CDT Sat Sep 04 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
50+ kts of mid-level flow will overspread the Pacific Northwest
while pivoting around an upper ridge across the western U.S. today.
Adequate boundary-layer mixing beneath the stronger mid-level flow
will encourage at least locally dry and breezy conditions across the
Northern and central Rockies into the northern High Plains. The best
chance for Elevated overlapping surface winds/RH would be across
portions of the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming into central/eastern
Montana and perhaps far western North Dakota by mid afternoon. Given
the relatively localized and brief nature of the Elevated
conditions, fire weather highlights were withheld this outlook.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0146 AM CDT Sat Sep 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level anticyclone/ridging will prevail across the western U.S.
tomorrow/Sunday, with 50-70 kts of 500 mb flow overspreading the
northern Rockies along the periphery of the upper ridge. The
presence of a relatively deep, mixed boundary layer by tomorrow
afternoon will encourage widespread 15-20 mph sustained westerly
surface winds amid 15-20% RH to develop across much of central
Montana into the Snake River Plain in Idaho, the Harney Basin in
southeast Oregon, and into the Great Divide Basin in Wyoming.
Elevated highlights have been added to portions of central and
Northern Montana, where upper support will be present for a
favorable, multi-hour surface winds/RH overlap, as also supported by
the latest high-resolution ensemble model guidance.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Sat Sep 04 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Sep 07 2021 - 12Z Sat Sep 11 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing will move into the Northeast Tuesday out of
southern Canada which should exit the East Coast around the end of
next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly direction
out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet and drier
than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the models and ensembles continued to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska
region which translates into the West toward the end of the
period. There have been enough run-to-run inconsistencies in all
the models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the
ensemble means (GEFS + ECENS mean) which have been more stable at
a cost of some detail. Overall the 12Z ECMWF was favored over the
GFS, which has been quite varied out of the Pacific.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. Some GFS runs have been more aggressive in
bringing tropical moisture and/or a system into Mexico and across
the border, but continued to favor a drier solution rather than
wetter. In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but
moisture transport northward/northeastward continues to look more
likely into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Great Lakes Tuesday as an area of low
pressure deepens over southern Canada. Some moderate to locally
heavy rainfall is possible across Michigan and parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, perhaps into New England on Wednesday as the warm
front lifts northward. Rainfall along the tail-end of the cold
front may be lighter into the Southeast. Increased tropical
moisture into the Gulf by midweek may bring the threat for
moderate to heavy rainfall along the northern/northeastern Gulf
Coast region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations, timing, and amounts. Maintained a
modest signal pending short term trends with the system.
Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the West to the Northern Rockies ahead of the
incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal
are possible as the area of warmth moves into the southern/central
Plains late next week. Temperatures in the Great Lakes/Northeast
will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally northwest
flow behind the cold front.

...Overview...

Upper ridging will drift out of the Great Basin early next week
toward the southern Plains as troughing moves into the Pacific
Northwest. Troughing will move into the Northeast Tuesday out of
southern Canada which should exit the East Coast around the end of
next week, steering Hurricane Larry in a more northerly direction
out over the open Atlantic. The pattern is largely quiet and drier
than average after a very active and wet several weeks.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the models and ensembles continued to
show relatively good clustering through the period, with expected
differences that grew with time. Large uncertainty remains
surrounding flow pattern over the northeast Pacific/Gulf of Alaska
region which translates into the West toward the end of the
period. There have been enough run-to-run inconsistencies in all
the models to continue favoring a majority blend towards the
ensemble means (GEFS + ECENS mean) which have been more stable at
a cost of some detail. Overall the 12Z ECMWF was favored over the
GFS, which has been quite varied out of the Pacific.

Over the Southwest, the movement of the upper high southeastward
may allow for an increase in moisture into the lower CO River
basin late next week. Some GFS runs have been more aggressive in
bringing tropical moisture and/or a system into Mexico and across
the border, but continued to favor a drier solution rather than
wetter. In the Gulf, tropical development remains uncertain but
moisture transport northward/northeastward continues to look more
likely into the northern/northeastern Gulf. Please see the NHC
outlooks for more information.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Rainfall will focus over the Great Lakes Tuesday as an area of low
pressure deepens over southern Canada. Some moderate to locally
heavy rainfall is possible across Michigan and parts of the Lower
Great Lakes, perhaps into New England on Wednesday as the warm
front lifts northward. Rainfall along the tail-end of the cold
front may be lighter into the Southeast. Increased tropical
moisture into the Gulf by midweek may bring the threat for
moderate to heavy rainfall along the northern/northeastern Gulf
Coast region, but models continue to show significant uncertainty
regarding exact locations, timing, and amounts. Maintained a
modest signal pending short term trends with the system.
Temperatures will be near to above normal over most areas,
especially in the West to the Northern Rockies ahead of the
incoming Pacific trough. Temperatures 5-15 degrees above normal
are possible as the area of warmth moves into the southern/central
Plains late next week. Temperatures in the Great Lakes/Northeast
will be near to a bit below normal thanks to generally northwest
flow behind the cold front.

...Organized thunderstorms expected to bring heavy rain and areas
of flash flooding today from the central Plains to the
Mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Seasonally cool from the Central Plains to Northeast but hot
and humid across the southern Plains; increasingly hot throughout
the West to promote poor air quality and wildfires...

...Occasional showers and storms over Florida, spreading eastward
into the Northeast and Appalachians by Labor Day...

The weather pattern across the U.S. this Labor Day weekend will
generally be much less active than previous weeks.  Nevertheless,
thunderstorms across much of Kansas this morning could be quite
strong as they generally track eastward near a wavy frontal
boundary.  Some of these storms will contain heavy downpours which
could lead to areas of flash flooding.  The heaviest rains should
then push further east into the mid-Mississippi Valley by tonight
while less vigorous showers and thunderstorms slowly move
southward across the central Plains.  The associated frontal
system will gradually merge with a larger low pressure system in
central Canada.  This will act to push the showers and
thunderstorms more steadily eastward across the Ohio Valley,
Appalachians, and into the Northeast on Sunday.   Some
thunderstorms could reach the Mid-Atlantic on Labor Day but the
best chance of showers and some thunderstorms appear to be in
Maine ahead of the frontal triple-point.  Meanwhile, showers and
thunderstorms will also move more steadily southward across the
southern Plains and parts of the southern Rockies on Sunday and
Monday near and ahead of the trailing cold front.

Temperature-wise, summer heat and humidity will be found ahead of
the trailing front across the southern Plains and lower
Mississippi Valley.  Daytime highs both today and Sunday should
reach the mid-upper 90s with heat indices as high as 110 degrees.
The aforementioned cold front should bring somewhat cooler
conditions to Oklahoma and northern Arkansas by Sunday, but south
Texas and the rest of the Deep South look to remain sultry.  Out
West, temperatures will return to above normal levels up and down
the West Coast on Saturday and will only get hotter as Labor
Weekend progresses.  The Great Valley of California may see highs
reaching the century mark in spots by Sunday.  The coolest weather
is set to be on the north-side of the cold front in the central
Plains where high temps will struggle to get out of the 70s
(roughly 10-15 degrees below normal).  The Northeast looks to
remain on the seasonally cool side each day this weekend, but
rising dew points will make a slightly more humid day on Sunday.
Summer heat and humidity are anticipated in the Southeast with the
whole region (excluding Florida) having a good chance to be mostly
dry heading into Labor Day.

Elsewhere, a quasi-stationary front will linger near the northern
Gulf Coast and over central Florida. This means daily rounds of
pop-up showers and storms each afternoon, some of which could
contains heavy downpours in these areas. Farther west, unsettled
weather is also on tap for parts of the Southwest where
atmospheric moisture content remains elevated.  Look for scattered
showers and storms to be a common occurrence in southern New
Mexico and into the Texas Panhandle this weekend. Lastly, Air
Quality Alerts remain in effect across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and California due to ongoing bouts with smoke from
ongoing wildfires.

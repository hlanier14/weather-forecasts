Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1008 AM CST Thu Jan 13 2022

Valid 131700Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (see below) remains on track, with no
additions or changes made.

..Squitieri.. 01/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0219 AM CST Thu Jan 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will remain centered over the Intermountain
West through this evening, prior to breaking down in response to an
approaching midlevel trough from the Pacific Northwest. At the
surface, high pressure will encompass most of the western and
central CONUS during the day, with lee troughing developing during
the overnight hours (into the Day 2/Friday period).

...Southern High Plains...
Dry/subsident northwesterly flow along the eastern periphery of the
upper ridge will foster critically low RH across the southern High
Plains this afternoon -- aided by deep boundary-layer mixing.
However, a weak surface pressure gradient and light winds will
generally limit the fire-weather threat for today.

...Heavy snow likely from the Applachians to the interior
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with significant icing possible for
parts of the Carolinas...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period is
a developing surface low pressure system that slides across the
Southeast on Sunday and then pivots northward near/along the East
Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper shortwave trough. This will
cause impactful wintry weather to spread across much of the East
early next week. However, some lingering uncertainty remains with
the exact low track, lending to low confidence in precipitation
type (which could change in some locations as the event
progresses), the axis of the heaviest snow, and the westward
extent of the snow. Meanwhile in the West, mainly dry conditions
are expected underneath surface high pressure, with the exception
of light precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The model guidance for the 00z/06z cycle show reasonable agreement
regarding the Southeast/East Coast surface low Sunday-Tuesday. The
new 12z guidance sticks pretty close to previous runs, with just
the typical run-to-run wobble variance. All of the deterministic
solutions now keep the low inland, with the 06z/12z GFS a hair
east, and the UKMET continuing to stick farther south. The
ensemble means are also a bit east of the deterministic solutions,
though still mostly along or just inland of the coast.
Interestingly enough, the 06z/12z GEFS mean continues to keep it's
low center offshore and displaced well to the east of its
deterministic counterpart, though there are a fair number of
ensemble members with an onshore low. WPC prefers a track a little
closer to the deterministic solutions, given the trend over the
past couple of days has been westward. The closest proxy to the
forecast was a blend of the 00z ECMWF and CMC, which places the
low over the Philadelphia region on Monday morning, and very close
to that of the previous WPC forecast as well. Given the spread in
the individual ensemble members, there still a fair amount of
uncertainty in the exact low track and even subtle shifts east or
west could create large changes in the impacts for especially the
major metropolitan cities along the I-95 corridor.


Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West early this
week, other than a meandering southern stream upper low centered
offshore of California. which should track eastward and eventually
join with the main flow by around Tuesday. Then there is good
model agreement for an amplified ridge over the West Coast by
Thursday drifting eastward from the Pacific, with some model
differences in possible embedded shortwaves particularly shown by
the GFS runs. Meanwhile, additional shortwaves reinforce troughing
centered over the Great Lakes Wednesday-Thursday, for which there
is reasonable model agreement on the next well defined cyclone to
traverse the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into eastern
Canada/northern New England by next Thursday.

The WPC medium range forecast was based on an initial blend of the
00Z/06Z deterministic guidance favoring the ECMWF and CMC for days
3-4. After this, added introduced increasing amounts of the
ensemble means to help mitigate some of the later period smaller
scale details differences. Overall, this presented a forecast very
close to previous WPC continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The surface low lifting from the Southeast and up the East Coast
will bring with it a full array of weather hazards and threats. At
this point, heavy snows are most likely in the Tennessee
Valley/southern Appalachians beginning this weekend, spreading
northward along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally
west of the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast
Sunday night into Monday. For locations east/along I-95 (including
the major metro areas of DC, Philadelphia, and New York City),
precipitation may start out as a quick burst of accumulating snow,
with a changeover to sleet and/or plain rain as warmer air filters
in from the east. Chances are also increasing for a potentially
significant icing event, especially from parts of northeast
Georgia, through parts of the Carolinas, and into central Virginia
where warm and moist Gulf of Mexico inflow will overrun initially
cold air at the surface. WPC has both the snow and ice threats
highlighted in todays hazard outlook. To the south, moderately to
locally heavy rain likely moves up the immediate East Coast Sunday
into Monday. Gusty winds surrounding the surface low may create
high waves off the coast leading to possible coastal flood
concerns along the Northeast coastline. Of course, all of this is
highly dependent on the exact track of the surface low and even
small adjustments back to the east could bring heavy snow
potential into even coastal parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the main low exits northeast of the U.S. on
Tuesday, another low pressure system is forecast to track over the
north-central U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring
some snow to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with possibly
higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The West could
see some light precipitation during the period, particularly over
the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Rockies early next
week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain could develop
again across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast beginning
Tuesday and increasing Wednesday with return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico.

Cooler than normal temperatures are expected generally over the
eastern U.S. early next week, with particularly chilly lows below
0F in the interior Northeast Sunday morning, about 15-25 degrees
below average. The West to the Plains can expect generally above
average conditions through Tuesday. Then as a cold surface high
drops into the north-central U.S. Wednesday and Thursday,
temperatures will fall to 10-20F below normal in the Upper Midwest.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF FAR SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO INTO WESTERN TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains generally on track. The latest
guidance consensus continues to depict widespread 15-20 percent
surface RH ahead of an approaching cold front across eastern New
Mexico into western Texas by early afternoon. The latest guidance
also shows overlapping 15-25 mph sustained westerly surface winds,
indicative of high-end Elevated to low-end Critical conditions.
Critical highlights have been maintained given the presence of very
dry fuels with 80-90th percentile ERCs, promoting an environment
quite favorable for wildfire spread.

..Squitieri.. 01/13/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0221 AM CST Thu Jan 13 2022/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and strong flow aloft will overspread the southern
Rockies and adjacent Plains during the day on Friday. In response,
an accompanying surface low will quickly deepen in the lee of the
central Rockies and evolve southward across the southern High
Plains. An attendant cold front will eventually move southward
across the region during the evening hours, with dry/breezy
conditions persisting behind the front. The combination of strong
deep-layer flow, a tightening surface pressure gradient, and
critically low RH atop highly receptive fuels warrants the
introduction of a Critical area over parts of Southwest Texas into
the Texas South Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
West-southwesterly surface winds will quickly strengthen ahead of
the approaching cold front, where downslope warming/drying will
result in critically low RH by late morning. The most substantial RH
reductions will likely develop over parts of Southwest Texas into
the Texas South Plains, where 10-15 percent RH will overlap 20+ mph
surface winds (with higher gusts) for a few hours. Here, critically
dry fuels (ERCs in 80th-90th percentile) will exacerbate the
wildfire-spread threat. Surrounding the Critical area, a few hours
of elevated conditions are expected, with embedded areas of locally
critical conditions possible. By the evening time frame, the cold
front will overspread the region, with a northerly wind shift and
dry/breezy conditions continuing into the overnight hours.

SYNOPSIS: There are increasing signals of a significant intrusion of Arctic
air
overspreading much of the central and eastern U.S. during week-2 tied to an
amplified 500-hPa height pattern forecast, with broad mid-level low pressur=

and eastward throughout the period. This pattern also favors an active stor=
m
track across the Rio Grande Valley, Gulf Coast, and Southeast, as well as
enhanced chances of lake effect snow. Surface low pressure forecast over th=

FOR FRIDAY JANUARY 21 - THURSDAY JANUARY 27: There is good agreement among =
the
model guidance in predicting broad 500-hPa troughing over the central and
eastern CONUS, with ridging forecast upstream centered over the Northeast
Pacific and western North America. This pattern favors anomalous northweste=
rly
mid-level flow over much of the CONUS, which will act to bring waves of Arc=
tic
air southward out of Canada. The coldest air is forecast across portions of
the
Midwest and Great Lakes as surface high pressure moves over the region. A h=
igh
risk for much below normal minimum temperatures is posted for Jan 21-26 ove=
r
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, and Upper Ohio Valley, =
as
the cold air mass will continue to be reinforced during this time. The ECMW=
F
reforecast tool depicts a 40-60% chance of minimum temperatures falling bel=
ow
the 15th climatological percentile across the highlighted high risk area.
Although the probabilities in the GEFS reforecast tool are lower (on the or=
der
of 20-40%), uncalibrated guidance from both the 0z GEFS and ECMWF ensembles
indicate negative minimum temperature anomalies of at least -10 deg F. This
translates to temperatures falling below 0 deg F over parts of the highligh=
ted
region, and approaching -10 deg F across portions of northern Minnesota and
the
western Great Lakes. Week-2 reforecast tools also indicate at least a 40%
chance of minimum temperatures falling below -20 deg F across parts of
northern
Minnesota. Although the reforecast tool probabilities are slightly lower th=
an
usual for a high risk (particularly for the GEFS), it was justified due to =
the
favorable synoptic set-up, and good agreement among the model guidance,
combined with it being the coldest time of year climatologically.



During the early to middle part of week-2, the anomalous cold is favored to
spread southward to the Gulf Coast and eastward to the Eastern Seaboard. A
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is posted much of the easte=
rn
half of the CONUS for all of week-2. Relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook, this
area
is expanded southward into the Deep South, just inland from the Gulf Coast,
where anomalous cold is anticipated near the middle of the period.
Temperatures
in the single digits and teens (deg F) are possible over parts of the Corn
Belt, Ohio Valley, and Northeast, in addition to subzero temperatures
continuing across the Upper Midwest and western Great Lakes. An active stor=
m
track in the East prior to and during week-2 may also increase the snow pac=
k
over parts of the Northeast, which favors larger negative temperature
anomalies. A slight risk for much below normal temperatures is posted for m=
uch
of the central and eastern CONUS, for all of week-2 given the potential for
the
anomalous cold to continue to expand as far south as the Gulf Coast. Both t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depict elevated probabilities (at least 40%=
)
of
subfreezing temperatures reaching inland areas of the Gulf Coast and Southe=
ast
during much of week-2. Frost and freeze concerns are elevated for many area=
s
of
the Southeast, extending to near and along the Gulf Coast.



During the first three days of week-2 (Jan 21-23), the synoptic pattern is
favorable for persistent northwesterly flow across the northeastern CONUS. =
The
persistent northwesterly flow coupled with above normal (and well above
freezing) water temperatures in the Great Lakes indicates an increased
likelihood for heavy snow across the region. This potential is further
enhanced
by a couple of low pressure systems that are forecast to move across these
areas during the first half of week-2. As such, a slight risk for heavy sno=
w
is
posted for the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes, Ohio Valley, and Northeast Jan 2=
1-
23.



Early in week-2, energy from a southern stream disturbance is predicted to =
be
picked up by the broad trough forecast over the central and eastern CONUS.
However, today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions indicate this fe=
ature to be weaker and more
short-lived, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 outlo=
ok. As such, the slight
risk
for heavy precipitation across southern Texas and extreme southwestern
Louisiana is removed in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 precipitat=
ion outlook.







Toward the end of week-2, the strong southward push of the arctic air mass
into
the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS increases the potential for low pressur=
e
to
develop along the base and leading edge of the trough axis and intensify ov=
er
the Atlantic Ocean. This increases the risk of high winds along coastal are=
as
of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast. However, there is increased uncertainty =
in
the timing of development and the track of a potential low pressure system,=
 so
no wind hazards are posted at this time for the CONUS.



Anomalous ridging and surface high pressure is forecast across the Northeas=
t
Pacific and Alaska during much of week-2, promoting increased southerly flo=
w
across Alaska. Additionally, troughing and associated surface low pressure
forecast over the north-central Pacific is forecast to move closer to Alask=
a,
which will result in strengthening pressure gradients and an enhancement of
the
southerly flow, both at the mid-levels and the surface. The GEFS and ECMWF
reforecast tools depict some areas along the southern coast of the Mainland
and
the northern Panhandle having at least a 20 percent chance of 3-day
precipitation exceeding the 85th climatological percentile and 2-inches
through
much of the period. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy precipitation is post=
ed
along the southern coast of Mainland Alaska, parts of the Alaska Peninsula,
and
the northern Alaska Panhandle Jan 21-26. An accompanying slight risk of hig=
h
winds is also posted for the many of these same areas, Jan 21-26, but exten=
ds
farther west to include all of the Alaska Peninsula (relative to the slight
risk for heavy precipitation) and farther east to include the central Alask=
a
Panhandle (relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2 U.S. ha=
zards outlook). The slight
risk for high winds is supported by the ECMWF reforecast tool, which depict=
s
at
least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th climatological percent=
ile
and 25-mph over these areas. The eastward expansion into the central Alaska
Panhandle is supported by a favorable synoptic setup increasing the potenti=
al
for low-level barrier jets along coastal areas.

...A quick-hitting winter storm is forecast to bring a swath of
heavy snow from North Dakota southeastward to Iowa...

...Arctic air is forecast to engulf th Northeast Friday night into
Saturday with dangerous wind chills possible on the back side of a
large oceanic storm...

After a period of relatively tranquil weather across much of the
Lower 48, the weather pattern will get very active in a hurry as
an upper-level trough digging through western Canada is forecast
to collide with another disturbance moving into the southern
Plains.  The rather vigorous Alberta clipper is forecast to bring
a round of moderate to heavy snow beginning tonight over North
Dakota, spreading quickly southeastward to Iowa for much of
Friday.  Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected
with locally a foot possible.  Difficult driving conditions are
likely throughout these areas as roads become snow covered
rapidly.  Visibility will also be greatly reduced within heavy
snowbands along with gusty winds.  As this clipper digs down the
northern Plains on Friday, it will gradually merge and join force
with another system developing in the southern Plains on Friday.
This will result in high winds to overspread the High Plains on
Friday as cold air plunges southward behind an intensifying low
pressure system.  Gusts in excess of 60 mph could result in
damaging impacts.  By Saturday, the low pressure system is
forecast to consolidate over the Deep South, with a swath of snow
dipping through the Mid-Mississippi Valley while showers and
thunderstorms are expected to blossom over the Deep South ahead of
a strong cold front.

Farther east, a very strong and rapidly strengthening storm system
in the eastern Atlantic Ocean will skim past New England on
Friday.  Gusty winds and rough surf will be felt along coastal New
England, with light snow potentially reaching into Interior
Downeast Maine and Cape Cod.  This system will help drag an arctic
air from eastern Canada and into the Northeast on Friday, setting
the stage for a bitter cold night into the weekend.  Temperatures
are forecast to drop into the single digits and below zero for
much of New England on Saturday morning, with wind chills making
it feel even colder.  For interior sections of the Northeast, wind
chills well below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in a
matter of minutes. Residents should plan ahead and dress properly,
including a hat and gloves.  This frigid airmass will also sink
into the northern Mid-Atlantic, with the weekend starting out in
the teens and low 20s in the morning.

Otherwise, warm and dry weather is forecast through Friday across
the southern Plains ahead of the approaching cold front.  Quiet
conditions will also be experienced throughout the Southeast,
Tennessee Valley, and Gulf Coast States before the aforementioned
low pressure system reaches the region by the weekend.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 19 - 23 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
predicting an amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. An amplified trough is forecast near the western
Aleutians
expanding northward into the Bering Sea, with associated below normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. Downstream, anomalous ridging is predicted by the ensemble means o=
ver
Mainland Alaska, the Gulf of Alaska, and the western CONUS, with positive
500-hPa height anomalies forecast across these regions. Anomalous troughing
and
associated near to below normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over most of t=
he
central an eastern CONUS.

A ridge forecast over the western CONUS favors elevated probabilities for n=
ear
to above normal temperatures for most of the western CONUS. Near to below
normal temperatures are favored for the remainder of the CONUS with the
highest
below probability (exceeding 80%) over the western Great Lakes areas, due t=
o
forecast troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights. Above normal temperatu=
re
probabilities are elevated over most of central and southern Alaska,
underneath
above normal 500-hPa heights and also associated with predicted low-level
onshore flow. Increased probabilities of near to below normal temperatures =
are
indicated over northern Mainland Alaska supported by the consolidation
forecast
tool.

Near to below normal precipitation is favored over most of the western CONU=
S
underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Near to below normal
precipitation is also favored eastward across parts of the Southern Plains =
to
parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley and Ohio Valley behind a forecast mea=
n
trough. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the North High
Plains due to the forecast frontal activity over the regions. Additionally,
probabilities of above normal precipitation are elevated for parts of the
Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast, and most of the
East
Coast, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Forecast low-level
onshore flow leads to increased chances of above normal precipitation over
much
of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 21 - 27 2022

A highly amplified mid-level 500-hPa pattern is forecast to continue into
week-2 with a slightly east progression. Anomalous ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights remain favored for the period over much of Alaska and the
western CONUS. Troughing and associated below normal mid-level heights are
forecast across most of the central and eastern CONUS.

Near to above normal temperatures are favored over most of the western CONU=
S
due to forecast ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights. Forecast troughin=
g
and below normal 500-hPa heights over the central and eastern CONUS favor
elevated probabilities of below normal temperatures for much of the central
and
eastern CONUS with the highest probability (exceeding 80%) over much of the
Great Lakes and parts of the Ohio Valley and Northeast. Above normal
temperature probabilities are elevated over Alaska, underneath an anomalous
ridge and also associated with predicted low-level southerly flow.

Below normal precipitation is favored across most of the western quarter of
the
CONUS, under the predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
precipitation probabilities are also enhanced eastward across parts of the
Southern Plains to most of the eastern CONUS consistent with the consolidat=
ion
forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the North=
ern
High Plains due to forecast frontal activity over the region. Probabilities=
 of
above normal precipitation are elevated for parts of the Southwest, Souther=
n
Plains and Northeast, also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.
Above normal precipitation is favored for Alaska, associated with forecast
low-level southerly flow.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Heavy snow likely from the Applachians to the interior
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast with significant icing possible for
parts of the Carolinas...


...Overview...

The most notable weather feature during the medium range period is
a developing surface low pressure system that slides across the
Southeast on Sunday and then pivots northward near/along the East
Coast ahead of a potent mid-upper shortwave trough. This will
cause impactful wintry weather to spread across much of the East
early next week. However, some lingering uncertainty remains with
the exact low track, lending to low confidence in precipitation
type (which could change in some locations as the event
progresses), the axis of the heaviest snow, and the westward
extent of the snow. Meanwhile in the West, mainly dry conditions
are expected underneath surface high pressure, with the exception
of light precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies as weak fronts track through.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The model guidance for the 00z/06z cycle show reasonable agreement
regarding the Southeast/East Coast surface low Sunday-Tuesday. The
new 12z guidance sticks pretty close to previous runs, with just
the typical run-to-run wobble variance. All of the deterministic
solutions now keep the low inland, with the 06z/12z GFS a hair
east, and the UKMET continuing to stick farther south. The
ensemble means are also a bit east of the deterministic solutions,
though still mostly along or just inland of the coast.
Interestingly enough, the 06z/12z GEFS mean continues to keep it's
low center offshore and displaced well to the east of its
deterministic counterpart, though there are a fair number of
ensemble members with an onshore low. WPC prefers a track a little
closer to the deterministic solutions, given the trend over the
past couple of days has been westward. The closest proxy to the
forecast was a blend of the 00z ECMWF and CMC, which places the
low over the Philadelphia region on Monday morning, and very close
to that of the previous WPC forecast as well. Given the spread in
the individual ensemble members, there still a fair amount of
uncertainty in the exact low track and even subtle shifts east or
west could create large changes in the impacts for especially the
major metropolitan cities along the I-95 corridor.


Elsewhere, ridging is likely to have hold of the West early this
week, other than a meandering southern stream upper low centered
offshore of California. which should track eastward and eventually
join with the main flow by around Tuesday. Then there is good
model agreement for an amplified ridge over the West Coast by
Thursday drifting eastward from the Pacific, with some model
differences in possible embedded shortwaves particularly shown by
the GFS runs. Meanwhile, additional shortwaves reinforce troughing
centered over the Great Lakes Wednesday-Thursday, for which there
is reasonable model agreement on the next well defined cyclone to
traverse the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into eastern
Canada/northern New England by next Thursday.

The WPC medium range forecast was based on an initial blend of the
00Z/06Z deterministic guidance favoring the ECMWF and CMC for days
3-4. After this, added introduced increasing amounts of the
ensemble means to help mitigate some of the later period smaller
scale details differences. Overall, this presented a forecast very
close to previous WPC continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The surface low lifting from the Southeast and up the East Coast
will bring with it a full array of weather hazards and threats. At
this point, heavy snows are most likely in the Tennessee
Valley/southern Appalachians beginning this weekend, spreading
northward along/on the backside of the deepening low and generally
west of the I-95 corridor in the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast
Sunday night into Monday. For locations east/along I-95 (including
the major metro areas of DC, Philadelphia, and New York City),
precipitation may start out as a quick burst of accumulating snow,
with a changeover to sleet and/or plain rain as warmer air filters
in from the east. Chances are also increasing for a potentially
significant icing event, especially from parts of northeast
Georgia, through parts of the Carolinas, and into central Virginia
where warm and moist Gulf of Mexico inflow will overrun initially
cold air at the surface. WPC has both the snow and ice threats
highlighted in todays hazard outlook. To the south, moderately to
locally heavy rain likely moves up the immediate East Coast Sunday
into Monday. Gusty winds surrounding the surface low may create
high waves off the coast leading to possible coastal flood
concerns along the Northeast coastline. Of course, all of this is
highly dependent on the exact track of the surface low and even
small adjustments back to the east could bring heavy snow
potential into even coastal parts of the East.

Elsewhere, after the main low exits northeast of the U.S. on
Tuesday, another low pressure system is forecast to track over the
north-central U.S. in response to a mid-upper shortwave and bring
some snow to the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes, with possibly
higher totals near typical lake enhancement areas. The West could
see some light precipitation during the period, particularly over
the Pacific Northwest and into the Northern Rockies early next
week, with mainly dry conditions elsewhere. Rain could develop
again across the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast beginning
Tuesday and increasing Wednesday with return flow from the Gulf of
Mexico.

Cooler than normal temperatures are expected generally over the
eastern U.S. early next week, with particularly chilly lows below
0F in the interior Northeast Sunday morning, about 15-25 degrees
below average. The West to the Plains can expect generally above
average conditions through Tuesday. Then as a cold surface high
drops into the north-central U.S. Wednesday and Thursday,
temperatures will fall to 10-20F below normal in the Upper Midwest.

...A quick-hitting winter storm is forecast to bring a swath of
heavy snow from North Dakota southeastward to Iowa...

...Arctic air is forecast to engulf the Northeast Friday night
into Saturday with dangerous wind chills possible on the back side
of a large oceanic storm...

After a period of relatively tranquil weather across much of the
Lower 48, the weather pattern will get very active in a hurry as
an upper-level trough digging through western Canada is forecast
to collide with another disturbance moving into the southern
Plains.  The rather vigorous Alberta clipper is forecast to bring
a round of moderate to heavy snow beginning tonight over North
Dakota, spreading quickly southeastward to Iowa for much of
Friday.  Widespread snowfall totals of 4 to 8 inches are expected
with locally a foot possible.  Difficult driving conditions are
likely throughout these areas as roads become snow covered
rapidly.  Visibility will also be greatly reduced within heavy
snowbands along with gusty winds.  As this clipper digs down the
northern Plains on Friday, it will gradually merge and join force
with another system developing in the southern Plains on Friday.
This will result in high winds to overspread the High Plains on
Friday as cold air plunges southward behind an intensifying low
pressure system.  Gusts in excess of 60 mph could result in
damaging impacts.  By Saturday, the low pressure system is
forecast to consolidate over the Deep South, with a swath of snow
dipping through the Mid-Mississippi Valley while showers and
thunderstorms are expected to blossom over the Deep South ahead of
a strong cold front.

Farther east, a very strong and rapidly strengthening storm system
in the eastern Atlantic Ocean will skim past New England on
Friday.  Gusty winds and rough surf will be felt along coastal New
England, with light snow potentially reaching into Interior
Downeast Maine and Cape Cod.  This system will help drag an arctic
air mass from eastern Canada into the Northeast on Friday, setting
the stage for a bitter cold night into the weekend.  Temperatures
are forecast to drop into the single digits and below zero for
much of New England on Saturday morning, with wind chills making
it feel even colder.  For interior sections of the Northeast, wind
chills well below zero could cause frostbite on exposed skin in a
matter of minutes. Residents should plan ahead and dress properly,
including a hat and gloves.  This frigid airmass will also sink
into the northern Mid-Atlantic, with the weekend starting out in
the teens and low 20s in the morning.

Otherwise, warm and dry weather is forecast through Friday across
the southern Plains ahead of the approaching cold front.  Quiet
conditions will also be experienced throughout the Southeast,
Tennessee Valley, and Gulf Coast States before the aforementioned
low pressure system reaches the region by the weekend.

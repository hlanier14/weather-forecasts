Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0957 AM CST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced for portions of east/southeast
WY where downslope winds will likely support a few hours of elevated
fire weather conditions. Zonal flow over the northern Rockies
coupled with the approach of a upper-level disturbance is resulting
in surface pressure falls on the order of 2-4 mb per 3 hours across
central MT and WY. Surface winds on the lee side of more prominent
terrain features are starting to increase and will likely strengthen
to 15-25 mph by this afternoon. While RH values are generally well
above 50% this morning, a few locations experiencing downslope winds
are showing reductions into the 15-30% range, which will become more
common through the afternoon. Elevated wind/RH conditions are most
likely in the immediate lee of the Laramie and Big Horn ranges where
ERC values are well above seasonal norms (and near record highs for
some locations). Other forecast concerns mentioned below remain
valid.

..Moore.. 12/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1248 AM CST Sat Dec 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong jet stream across the Canadian border will begin to amplify
by the end of today. As this occurs, a surface trough will deepen
and slide eastward from the northern Rockies into the northern
Plains. High pressure will build into the Northwest and Great Basin.

...Eastern Wyoming...
Strong flow at mid-levels will shift southward over Wyoming during
the day. With the surface trough deepening in the High Plains,
strong westerly winds will develop by afternoon. Winds could reach
20-25 mph. With the recent cold font, temperatures will be rather
cool outside of areas of downslope winds. Locally elevated
conditions are possible in the lee of the Big Horns and Laramie
Range where RH is more likely to drop to around 20%.

...Southern California...
A modest offshore pressure gradient is expected to develop by late
Saturday into early Sunday. Northerly/northeasterly winds aloft will
also strengthen through the period along the westerly flank of a
mid-level trough. RH reductions to near 15-20% may occur along with
winds of 15-20 mph. Models continue to trend slightly weaker with
the offshore gradient strength. Elevated conditions will be confined
to higher terrain and are not expected to become widespread.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1254 PM CST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

An Elevated risk area is introduced for portions of southeast CO and
far northeast NM. Recent fuel analyses from these areas show ERC
values near or above record highs for early December. This will
support a fire weather threat as downslope winds increase to 15-25
mph amid RH reductions into the teens and low 20s. Although the
threat may be confined spatially to the immediate lee of terrain
features, the very dry fuels coupled with the anticipated wind/RH
warrant a risk highlight. The duration of these conditions will be
determined by the southward progression of a cold front during the
afternoon, but at least 2-3 hours of elevated conditions seem
likely.

Elsewhere, the forecast remains on track with only minor adjustments
need based on recent hi-res guidance. See the previous discussion
for additional details.

..Moore.. 12/04/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1250 AM CST Sat Dec 04 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue to amplify as it moves into the
northern Plains and eventually the upper Midwest on Sunday. At the
surface, a stronger cold front will push quickly through the Plains
during the day. Across the western coast, northerly mid-level winds
will remain along with high surface pressure in the Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather is expected to occur as
the surface pressure gradient tightens ahead of the advancing cold
front. Winds of 15-25 mph are possible. RH will generally fall to
near 20%, but some locations could see values as low as 15%.

...Southern California...
The modest offshore pressure gradient will likely peak on Sunday
into Monday morning. A few hours of locally elevated conditions are
likely within the higher terrain/foothills from Santa Barbara into
Ventura and Los Angeles Counties. RH near 15% is probable, but
sustained winds will not be overly strong away from wind-prone
areas. A few stronger gusts to 35-40 mph may occur given the
favorable winds aloft.

...Central Plains...
Localized fire weather concerns are possible ahead of the front in
parts of eastern Colorado into western Kansas. RH of less than 20%
appears probable, but winds of 15-20 mph will likely only occur in
terrain-favored locations. Northerly winds of 20-30 mph behind the
cold front may briefly coincide with marginally reduced RH. RH
recovery behind the front will be swift, however.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sat Dec 04 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Dec 07 2021 - 12Z Sat Dec 11 2021

...Notable snow possible in the interior Northeast around
Wednesday, with wintry impacts potentially reaching southward into
the I-95 corridor/northern Mid-Atlantic, while locally heavy rain
may occur over the Southeast...

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies during the latter
half of next week...

...Overview...

Latest guidance maintains a broad mean trough aloft across much of
the lower 48 next week, with an axis generally extending from
central/east-central Canada into the western U.S. Embedded
shortwaves will push low pressure/frontal systems across the
country, leading to a more active weather pattern than has been
the case lately. In particular, parts of the West should see
meaningful precipitation--possibly extending into parts of the
Plains late in the week--while the intensity/coverage of rainfall
should increase over the southeastern quadrant of the country and
some impactful snow may fall over northern parts of the East.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Embedded shortwave uncertainties continue to lower confidence in
some important details within a much more agreeable mean pattern.
In terms of the combined guidance spread and associated impacts of
the varied solutions, one of the greatest issues in latest cycles
has been with the ultimate evolution of shortwave energy that
progresses from the northern Plains/western U.S. as of early
Tuesday into the East by late Wednesday/early Thursday. There is a
clear signal for the shortwave's existence but subtle
low-predictability differences lead to very different surface
solutions for low pressure that tracks off the East Coast along
with associated coverage/intensity of precipitation and location
of the rain-snow line. Latest GFS runs have been on the strong
side of the spread with the shortwave and on the deep/west side at
the surface by early Thursday while the 00Z ECMWF/ECMWF mean are
on the weak/eastern side. Low confidence with fine details for
this feature would favor an intermediate solution for strength and
track, closest to a deeper version of the 06Z GEFS mean.

One upstream uncertainty involves a bundle of energy that
originally comes from an upper low over the mid-lower latitudes of
the Pacific, with differences over whether it drops around the
east/southeast side of the Pacific upper ridge (ECMWF/UKMET/CMC)
or progresses along within the lower 48 mean trough (GFS). There
is also some spread for details of northern stream Pacific energy
that should reach western North America by Wednesday and support
southern Canada low pressure with trailing front that crosses the
western/central U.S. At least relative to typical behavior for 6-7
days out in time, models and ensemble means are generally better
behaved than average for the upper trough that should dig into the
West late in the week and then push into the Plains. However
individual runs/ensemble members do still vary considerably for
exactly how energy will be distributed within the overall trough
and by next Saturday for details of corresponding low pressure
along a mean front within a corridor between the Great Lakes and
southern Plains.

Guidance comparisons/preferences led to starting the forecast with
a 00Z/06Z operational model composite for days 3-4
Tuesday-Wednesday, followed by somewhat earlier input of 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means than average by Thursday (30 percent total)
and then 50-60 percent means for Friday-Saturday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf moisture should increase by Tuesday into Wednesday ahead of
frontal systems and cause moderate to possibly locally heavy
rainfall from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee
Valley and Southeast. Moisture spreading farther north into cooler
air should produce snow across the northern latitudes, with the
highest probabilities of meaningful snow across the Northeast.
There is still considerable uncertainty over how low pressure from
the eastern U.S. into the western Atlantic will evolve/track, so
confidence is fairly low for exactly how much precipitation may
fall over the Northeast, and how far south significant snow
reaches. Some rain could continue late next week near a wavy front
lingering over the extreme Southeast.

Expect fairly light precipitation over the Pacific Northwest and
the Four Corners states on Tuesday, before precipitation chances
and amounts increase from midweek onward. As shortwave energy and
troughing drop southward through the West, precipitation will
spread from the Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies Wednesday
southward to California into the Great Basin to Central Rockies
Thursday and Friday. Favored terrain in Arizona could also see
some enhanced activity. Generally expect higher elevation snow and
lower elevation rain, with snow levels likely to decline later in
the week as upper troughing amplifies over the West. Parts of
Southern California may see the first rainfall in over a month.
Then as the western upper trough approaches/pushes into the Plains
toward the end of the week, rainfall may become moderate to heavy
over parts of the east-central U.S. by next Saturday with the aid
of strengthening Gulf inflow ahead of a wavy front. The character
of one or more frontal waves will determine precipitation amounts
and possible winter weather impacts over the Plains and Midwest.

Chilly temperatures are likely across the far north-central U.S.
into the Great Lakes on Tuesday given snow cover from
Sunday-Monday's system, with temperatures 10-20F below normal.
Highs of 10F or so below normal could reach as far south as the
Ohio Valley. The negative anomalies will moderate as the airmass
continues into the Northeast U.S. on Wednesday. Farther upstream,
the West will see mostly above normal readings through midweek
(some pockets of plus 10-15F anomalies) with more pronounced
warming likely over the Plains on Thursday and progressing into
the East by next weekend. There should be fairly broad coverage of
plus 10-20F anomalies for highs/morning lows, and in addition
highs over parts of the southern Plains on Friday plus morning
lows from the Mississippi Valley northeastward on Saturday may
reach 20-25F above normal. A few places in the far southern tier
(primarily Texas) could approach daily record highs. Cooler
temperatures should spread into the West and eventually High
Plains late in the week (highs 5-15F or so below normal by Friday
and Saturday) under an amplifying upper trough.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat December 04 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Heavy snow and high winds across the Upper Midwest on Sunday
into Monday...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall and a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi,
Southern Ohio, and Tennessee Valleys on Sunday into Monday
morning...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average over parts
of the Central/Southern Plains into the adjacent Middle/Lower
Mississippi Valley...

A rapidly deepening storm over the Northern High Plains will move
eastward to the Upper Great Lakes by Monday and into Canada by
Monday evening. The system will produce snow over parts of the
Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains that will steadily
spread eastward across the Northern Tier States into the Upper
Great Lakes by Sunday afternoon. As a result, High Wind Watches,
Winter Storm Advisories, and Winter Storm Warnings are up along
the Northern Tier through Sunday. These warnings will likely
expand eastward over the Great Lakes on Sunday into Monday. The
storm will produce heavy snow and strong wind from the Northern
Plains into the Upper Great Lakes through Sunday night.  The snow
and wind will result in reduced visibilities and hazardous driving
conditions. This will also be the first widespread heavy snowfall
of the winter season.

Meanwhile, moisture from the Western Gulf of Mexico will start to
pool along the associated front producing rain over parts of the
Great Lakes, Ohio, Middle/Lower Mississippi, and Tennessee Valleys
by Sunday evening.  Overnight Sunday, showers and thunderstorms
will develop along and ahead of the front over the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys; some of these thunderstorms
will be severe. Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of
severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys for Sunday into Monday morning.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. Moreover,
heavy rain will develop with the showers and thunderstorms.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi, Southern Ohio, and
Tennessee Valleys on Sunday into Monday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Furthermore, temperatures will be 15 to 25 degrees above average
over parts of the Central/Southern Plains into the adjacent
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley on Sunday. Elsewhere, onshore flow
will aid in producing rain and higher elevation snow over the
Pacific Northwest through Sunday morning.  Overnight Sunday,
upper-level energy and onshore flow will produce a new round of
rain and snow over the Northwest that will expand inland over
parts of the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies. Furthermore,
Monday, the snow levels will be low over parts of the Northwest.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1242 AM CST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...Synopsis...
The jet stream will become more amplified today as an upper trough
deepens in the northern and central Plains. This will promote a
deepening surface low in the upper Midwest. A cold front will push
southward into the southern Plains by the end of the period. High
pressure will also build into the Great Basin.

...Southern High Plains...
An area of strong westerly surface winds will develop ahead of the
cold front across east-central New Mexico into the Texas South
Plains. Winds will range from 15-20 mph with perhaps locally higher
speeds. RH will fall to 15-20%. Dry fuels will support elevated to
locally critical fire weather.

...Southeastern Colorado...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather is probable as a favorable
pressure gradient sets up perpendicular to the Rockies/Sangre de
Cristo. Westerly winds of 15-25 mph are possible along with RH
nearing 10-15%. Critical conditions are most likely within the
mountain passes.

...Northeastern Colorado...
Briefly elevated conditions are possible immediately behind the cold
front due to some remaining downslope component of the surface
winds. However, RH will increase rapidly behind the front,
precluding highlights.

...Southern California...
Offshore winds will increase modestly through the day, perhaps
peaking during the evening into Monday morning. Upper-level winds
will support a few stronger gusts in the wind-prone terrain areas.
Overall, the scenario shown in model guidance along with pressure
gradient magnitude trends suggest locally elevated conditions
confined to the terrain from Santa Barbara into Los Angeles
Counties. Any critical conditions would be even more localized and
brief.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1244 AM CST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move through the Midwest and
Northeast on Monday. In its wake, cold air will be situated within
much of the Plains. Dry post-frontal conditions are possible in
parts of western and central Texas. However, the strongest winds are
expected during the beginning of the day prior to RH minima during
the afternoon. Locally elevated conditions are most likely in parts
of the Texas Low Rolling Plains, where fuels remain modestly dry and
15-20 mph winds could overlap 20-25% RH for a couple of hours.

159 AM EST Sun Dec 05 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 08 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 12 2021

...Some snow is possible on Wednesday for portions of the
Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic, potentially including the
I-95 corridor...

...Considerable mountain snows are likely across the Cascades,
Sierra Nevada, Intermountain West, and Rockies during the latter
half of next week...

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Wednesday with a broad mean trough
across much of the lower 48, with embedded shortwaves pushing low
pressure/frontal systems across the country, leading to a
continuing active weather pattern. Expect one system to spread
widespread rain to the Southeast on Wednesday while northeastern
parts of the U.S. may see snow. As energy drops southward through
the western side of the broad trough Thursday into Friday,
troughing in the West will amplify and move into the central U.S.
by the weekend. This will bring the potential for meaningful
precipitation and heavy mountain snows in the West, with
precipitation spreading into the central and eastern U.S. by late
in the week along and ahead of a strong cold front.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

While the overall large scale pattern remains agreeable among
model guidance, embedded shortwave uncertainties continue to lower
confidence in some important details. One notable example is with
shortwave energy located near the north-central U.S. early
Wednesday and its depth and evolution as it tracks eastward late
Wednesday into Thursday. There is a clear signal for the
shortwave's existence but subtle low-predictability differences
lead to very different surface solutions for low pressure that
tracks off the East Coast along with associated coverage/intensity
of precipitation and location of the rain-snow line. GFS runs
continue to be among the slowest and deepest with the midlevel
shortwave and thus the surface low tracks farther west closer to
the Northeast coast compared to consensus. This was particularly
true with the 12Z run but the 18Z and 00Z runs are somewhat west
as well. The overall trend (including the new 00Z ECMWF) has been
for a more suppressed solution with a low track flatter and
farther offshore, meaning less precipitation indicated for the
northeastern quadrant of the CONUS overall, though also a colder
trend, so precipitation could be more likely to fall as snow.
Favored an intermediate solution with some component of the 18Z
GFS but combined with the 12Z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET for the early part
of the medium range period. Other southern stream shortwave
differences in the Southwest/eastern Pacific early in the forecast
period fortunately have less sensible weather impacts.

Considering the high latitude/low predictability origins of
shortwave energy dropping southward serving to amplify the trough
in the West, model guidance is pretty agreeable with the overall
idea of the trough deepening on Friday and pushing eastward
through the weekend. However individual runs/ensemble members do
still vary considerably for exactly how energy will be distributed
within the overall trough, and while there is fairly good
consensus for the position of a cold front ahead of the trough,
positions of low pressure waves along the front vary within a
corridor between the Great Lakes and Southern Plains on Saturday
and in the eastern U.S. by Sunday. As the period progressed,
transitioned to a 60% deterministic and 40% ensemble mean (EC and
GEFS) blend to temper individual model differences in the forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Gulf moisture in place by Wednesday ahead of frontal systems will
lead to widespread rainfall across the Southeast. Showers are
forecast to linger there through the latter part of the workweek
as a wavy front slowly lifts northward. Moisture spreading farther
north into cooler air may produce snow across the northern
latitudes on Wednesday, with the highest probabilities of snow
across parts of the Northeast. There is still considerable
uncertainty regarding how low pressure from the eastern U.S. into
the western Atlantic will evolve/track, so confidence is fairly
low for exactly how much precipitation may fall over the
Northeast, and the extent of notable snow.

As shortwave energy and troughing drop southward through the West,
precipitation will spread from the Pacific Northwest and Northern
Rockies Wednesday southward to California into the Great Basin to
Central Rockies Thursday and Friday. Favored terrain in Arizona
could also see some enhanced activity. Generally expect higher
elevation snow and lower elevation rain, with snow levels likely
to decline later in the week as upper troughing amplifies over the
West. Parts of Southern California may see the first rainfall in
over a month. Then as the western upper trough approaches/pushes
into the Plains toward the end of the week, rainfall may become
moderate to heavy over parts of the east-central U.S. by next
Saturday with the aid of strengthening Gulf inflow ahead of a wavy
front. The character of one or more frontal waves will determine
precipitation amounts and possible winter weather impacts over the
Plains and Midwest.

Temperatures Wednesday will be about 10-15F above average for the
High Plains, and expect temperatures to only warm from there
across the central and eventually eastern U.S. as the pattern
amplifies. By Friday temperatures in the Southern Plains and the
Lower/Middle Mississippi Valley are forecast to be 15-25F above
normal, with highs nearing or exceeding 80F in parts of Texas,
which could approach records. Mild temperatures with highs 15-25F
and lows 15-30F above normal will spread into the eastern U.S. for
the weekend, while central U.S. temperatures should moderate back
to normal behind the potent cold front. Meanwhile, cooler than
average temperatures by around 10-15F are forecast for parts of
the West particularly on Friday and Saturday given the amplifying
upper trough.

...Heavy snow and gusty winds to impact parts of the Northern
Plains, Upper Midwest, and Great Lakes through Monday...

...Strong cold front to produce isolated severe thunderstorms and
heavy rain tonight from the lower Ohio Valley to the Southern
Plains...

An ongoing winter storm impacting the northern tier will continue
producing periods of heavy snow and gusty winds between the
Northern Plains and Upper Great Lakes today. An area of low
pressure responsible for this winter weather is forecast to enter
northern Minnesota this afternoon and strengthen as it swings into
the Upper Great Lakes by Monday morning. Moderate-to-heavy snow
will be found near and to the north of the low pressure center
between eastern North Dakota and northern Michigan. Storm total
snowfall amounts greater than six inches, with localized maximum
amounts up to a foot are likely for this region. High winds
trailing the system will make conditions even more treacherous for
areas under a blanket of fresh snowfall. Low visibility and slick
roadways will most likely be an issue until late-Monday, after the
system exits into southeast Canada. By Monday night into Tuesday
morning, the only leftover snow showers will be associated with
lake effect snow as bitterly cold air rushes over the still
ice-free Great Lakes. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather
Advisories are currently in effect and stretch from northern North
Dakota to northern Michigan. High Wind Warnings and Wind
Advisories have also been issued across parts of the Northern
Plains and central High Plains due to the potential for wind gusts
up to 70 mph.

The other potential weather hazard associated with this storm
system will be found along and ahead of a racing cold front. This
attached frontal boundary and cold airmass in its wake is forecast
to clash with the well above average temperatures found throughout
much of the southern and eastern United States. As it does so, a
line of showers and thunderstorms is expected to develop by this
evening and stretch from the lower Ohio Valley to eastern Texas.
Isolated severe weather is possible along this line of storms,
particularly from western Tennessee to the ArkLaTex region.
Damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated tornadoes are all a
possibility. Additionally, periods of heavy rain could lead to a
few instances of flash flooding from far southwest Ohio to
northeast Arkansas. By Monday, the cold front and marginal severe
weather threat is expected to shift into the Deep South and
western/central Gulf Coast. Elsewhere, showers are also forecast
across the Northeast on Monday as the aforementioned cold front
pushes into the region. Meanwhile, potentially damaging wind gusts
could impact areas along the Lower Great Lakes following the cold
frontal passage. High Wind Watches and Lakeshore Flood Watches
have been issued along parts of western New York to highlight the
concern.

Otherwise, active weather will also be found across the Northwest
as storm system enters from the Pacific and interacts with a
relatively cold airmass in place on Monday. Light snow is forecast
to fall across the typical mountainous terrain of the Cascades and
Olympics, with snowflakes also potentially mixing into the lower
elevations of Washington. Portions of the northern and central
Rockies may also experience a festive light snowfall between
Monday and Tuesday morning.

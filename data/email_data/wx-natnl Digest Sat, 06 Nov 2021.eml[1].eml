...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. Please see the discussion
below for more information on today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 11/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1225 AM CDT Fri Nov 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning surface observations show a gradually deepening
surface low in the lee of the Canadian Rockies. This feature is
expected to shift eastward into the Canadian Prairies through the
day in tandem with an associated upper-level wave. A trailing
surface trough will also shift east through the Plains, resulting in
westerly winds across the northern to central High Plains. Sustained
winds between 15-25 mph are probable across central to eastern MT
and southeast WY, and occasional gusts upwards of 25-40 mph are
possible. Downslope winds may help RH values fall to 15-30% across
these regions, but fuels remain generally too moist to support a
robust fire weather concern.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) begins with a
shortwave/upper low exiting the southeast Coast as a deepened
surface low off the East Coast increasingly shifts over the
Atlantic Monday/Tuesday. Behind this, a stable and warm upper
ridge extends from the southern Plains to the Northeast. Out West,
an upper low rotating through the Gulf of Alaska/northeast Pacific
will send a couple shortwave/troughs across the Western U.S.
propagating eastward with time. The models suggest the second
stortwave crossing the West Coast around Tuesday of next week may
amplify over the Central U.S. mid week with possible upper/surface
low development across the Midwest later next week.

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pettern evolution, but plenty of uncertainty
in the details, timing, and strength of systems. Right off the
bat, the GFS is different with the exiting Eastern U.S. trough,
showing more defined northern/southern stream separation and a
stronger/more south surface low well off the Southeast Coast. The
06z GFS is also problematic farther upstream showing a weaker
shortwave crossing the Midwest. Bigger issues/uncertainties arise
late period as troughing amplifies over the Central U.S. with some
guidance showing closed upper low development by Thursday/Friday
next week. Run to run variability suggests models struggle with
whether this is a feature at all, but regardless should bring at
least a defined low pressure system into the Midwest by late next
week.

This set of WPC progs used a general model blend of the latest
deterministic solutions for days 3-4, increasingly blending more
towards the ensemble means later in the period. This helped
mitigate some of those less uncertain details and timing issues,
especially with the late week troughing into the central U.S. and
Midwest. This approach maintains good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The low off the East Coast should present only maritime threats,
though some modestly gusty winds may still be present along the
East Coast on Monday. The first system into the upper Midwest
early in the week may bring some scattered showers to parts of the
Great Lakes/Midwest Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile, the series of
Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with upper
troughing set to work over the Northwest into midweek. This will
highlight periods of terrain enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to central California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades to the Sierra and inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies with a cooling frontal passage.
Amplified upper troughing into the central U.S. is slated to be
sandwiched between upper ridges over the West Coast and East Coast
within an overall pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis would act to favor an emerging lead
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. as theta-e
advection increases. Backside cold air flow also suggests
potential for late next week snows over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest
as moisture feeds back around a developing main low. Please see
WPC links below for all the details.

Initial upper ridging from the southern Plains to Great
Lakes/Northeast should result in modestly above normal highs
Monday-Tuesday (lingering longer over the Northeast). Mean
troughing over the West most of the week should keep temperatures

Extended Forecast Discussion

135 PM EDT Fri Nov 05 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 08 2021 - 12Z Fri Nov 12 2021

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) begins with a
shortwave/upper low exiting the southeast Coast as a deepened
surface low off the East Coast increasingly shifts over the
Atlantic Monday/Tuesday. Behind this, a stable and warm upper
ridge extends from the southern Plains to the Northeast. Out West,
an upper low rotating through the Gulf of Alaska/northeast Pacific
will send a couple shortwave/troughs across the Western U.S.
propagating eastward with time. The models suggest the second
stortwave crossing the West Coast around Tuesday of next week may
amplify over the Central U.S. mid week with possible upper/surface
low development across the Midwest later next week.

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pettern evolution, but plenty of uncertainty
in the details, timing, and strength of systems. Right off the
bat, the GFS is different with the exiting Eastern U.S. trough,
showing more defined northern/southern stream separation and a
stronger/more south surface low well off the Southeast Coast. The
06z GFS is also problematic farther upstream showing a weaker
shortwave crossing the Midwest. Bigger issues/uncertainties arise
late period as troughing amplifies over the Central U.S. with some
guidance showing closed upper low development by Thursday/Friday
next week. Run to run variability suggests models struggle with
whether this is a feature at all, but regardless should bring at
least a defined low pressure system into the Midwest by late next
week.

This set of WPC progs used a general model blend of the latest
deterministic solutions for days 3-4, increasingly blending more
towards the ensemble means later in the period. This helped
mitigate some of those less uncertain details and timing issues,
especially with the late week troughing into the central U.S. and
Midwest. This approach maintains good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The low off the East Coast should present only maritime threats,
though some modestly gusty winds may still be present along the
East Coast on Monday. The first system into the upper Midwest
early in the week may bring some scattered showers to parts of the
Great Lakes/Midwest Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile, the series of
Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with upper
troughing set to work over the Northwest into midweek. This will
highlight periods of terrain enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to central California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades to the Sierra and inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies with a cooling frontal passage.
Amplified upper troughing into the central U.S. is slated to be
sandwiched between upper ridges over the West Coast and East Coast
within an overall pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis would act to favor an emerging lead
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. as theta-e
advection increases. Backside cold air flow also suggests
potential for late next week snows over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest
as moisture feeds back around a developing main low. Please see
WPC links below for all the details.

Initial upper ridging from the southern Plains to Great
Lakes/Northeast should result in modestly above normal highs
Monday-Tuesday (lingering longer over the Northeast). Mean
troughing over the West most of the week should keep temperatures
below normal, with eventually translate downstream towards the
central U.S. by Friday as near to maybe above normal temperatures
move into the West Coast states.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT November 05 2021

SYNOPSIS: Amplified mid-level low (high) pressure is anticipated to dominate
the eastern (western) lower 48 during week-2, gradually weakening throughout
the period. This mid-level low pressure may usher cold air southward to parts
of the lower 48 from Canada at the beginning of the period. Surface low
pressure is expected to form over eastern Canada with associated frontal
activity  ahead of the mid-level low pressure, followed by possible surface
low
formation over the Carolinas tracking near the East Coast. These disturbances
may bring increased chances for heavy precipitation to eastern portions of the
contiguous U.S. Mid-level low pressure over the Mainland of Alaska at the end
of week-1 is predicted to transition to high pressure at the start of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures shifting eastward from the
Central and Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern
Appalachians, and Southeast, Sat-Mon, Nov 13-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic,
eastern Great Lakes, and Central Appalachians, Sat-Mon, Nov 13-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for western portions of Washington, Sat-
Mon,
Nov 13-15.

Slight risk of high winds along the southern California coast, Sat-Sun, Nov
13-14.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY NOVEMBER 08 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 12:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!tmJdapbmDvAKNur2LSd6cnmIAJJTMuJ-IMMUnPCsGdrMmKr_evTkloStRK_q6-uuYXB0yObU$

FOR SATURDAY NOVEMBER 13 - FRIDAY NOVEMBER 19: There is good multi-model
agreement indicating amplified mid-level troughing forecast across the eastern
half of the CONUS at the beginning of the period, gradually weakening
throughout week-2. This pattern may support anomalously cool temperatures to
sink southward from Canada at the beginning of the period. A slight risk of
much below normal temperatures is anticipated to shift eastward from the
Central and Southern Plains to the Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern
Appalachians, and Southeast, Nov 13 to 15, as this mid-level trough is
expected
to be relatively progressive. The much below normal temperature risk area
highlights where reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and below freezing. Minimum
temperatures may reach these thresholds across the eastern Four Corners Region
and western Texas on day 8 (Nov 13). However, due to the expectation that this
anomalous cold would be relatively brief over this area, it is not included in
the designated risk area. Today's 6Z deterministic GFS and ensemble means
shows
some areas experiencing negative temperature anomalies reaching 12 Deg F or
greater. For some of the areas across the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Southeast, this would be the first freeze of the season.



Today's 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian daily ensemble means indicate surface low
formation over eastern Canada, with a trailing front moving across parts of
the
Eastern Seaboard at the start of the period. Additionally, these ensemble
means
and recent deterministic GFS runs also indicate potential surface low
formation
over the Carolinas, tracking along the East Coast, as the aforementioned
surface low exits the Northeast. The GEFS reforecast tool limits the greater
than 20% chance of 3-day accumulated liquid equivalent exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch to parts of the Northeast, whereas the uncalibrated
ECMWF ensemble mean indicates a comparably broader area of 3-day totals having
elevated probabilities of exceeding one inch. Given the added uncertainty
regarding the details of these features, a broad area is highlighted across
parts of the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, eastern Great Lakes, and Central
Appalachians for a slight risk of heavy precipitation, Nov 13 to 15.



Models continue to support possible surface low formation over the Northern
Plains towards the middle of the period, tracking towards the Great Lakes.
Some
areas may receive lake effect snow, with the lakes generally having warm
surface temperatures and cold air temperatures aloft anticipated. There is
high
uncertainty regarding the orientation and track of the storm, precluding a
specific related heavy snow hazard from being designated at this time.



Surface low pressure is anticipated to form across the Northeast Pacific at
the
beginning of week-2, which could support strong onshore flow into the Pacific
Northwest. The GFS and ECMWF indicate enhanced integrated water vapor
transport
(IVT) values (greater than 250 kg/m/s), conducive for heavy precipitation
across the region at the beginning of the period. The reforecast tools favor
portions of western Washington  as having at least a 20% chance of 3-day
accumulated liquid equivalent exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch. A
general area of slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of
western Washington, Nov 13 to 15. Lower elevations are most likely to receive
heavy precipitation in the form of rainfall, with possible heavy snow in
higher
elevation areas of the Cascades.



Mid-level troughing across the Alaska Mainland is expected to transition to
ridging during the beginning of the period, and prevail throughout the
remainder of the week-2 period. This pattern shift limits the likelihood for
much below normal temperatures, thus the related risk in yesterday's outlook
is
removed in today's. Although surface low pressure is forecast to form over the
Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska, no related hazards are posted associated with
this feature, with the majority of the focus of enhanced moisture being
further
south.



Multiple models continue to indicate the potential for surface high pressure
centered over the interior West at the beginning of the period, implying a
potential for strong downsloping Santa Ana winds in southern California to the
west of the coastal mountain ranges. A slight risk of high winds is posted
along the Southern California coast, Nov 13 to 14. The threat for high winds
decreases later in week-2, as the surface high pressure starts to weaken and
the pressure gradient in southern California begins to relax. These enhanced
winds could enhance the risk for wildfire potential across portions of
Southern
California, where the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) shows some areas
forecast to have enhanced risk of wildfires leading up to week-2.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0131 AM CDT Fri Nov 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue to deepen along the West Coast
through the early weekend, resulting in additional precipitation
chances across the Pacific Northwest and parts of the northern Great
Basin/northern Rockies. Weak lee troughing along the high Plains
will result in localized areas of gusty downslope winds that may
support periods of elevated wind/RH conditions. Ensemble consensus
suggests the most likely location for this to occur is across
southeast CO into adjacent areas of KS, NM, and the OK/TX
Panhandles. However, confidence the duration/coverage of such
conditions is low, and ERC values across the region are near
seasonal normals, suggesting only modest fire weather potential.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri November 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 11 - 15 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Dynamical models forecast a ridge with above-normal mid-level
heights over the Bering Sea and western Alaska, while a trough is forecast
over
the Gulf of Alaska extending southwestward over the North Pacific. A ridge is
predicted over the western CONUS, while a trough is predicted over the
east-central CONUS with below normal mid-level heights. A ridge is predicted
over the northeastern CONUS by most model solutions, with associated
above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Below-normal temperatures are favored for southwestern Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, under anomalous easterly and northerly flow. Below-normal
temperatures are also favored for the southern coast of Mainland Alaska and
the
Alaska Panhandle, with increased cloudiness and onshore flow. Above-normal
temperatures are favored for the northwestern and northern coastal areas of
Mainland Alaska, under a ridge. Above-normal temperatures are favored for the
western CONUS, under a predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies,
and for the northeastern CONUS, under anomalous southerly flow. Below-normal
temperatures are favored for eastern areas of the Southern and Central Plains
and the Lower Mississippi Valley, as well as the southern Florida Peninsula,
under a predicted trough.

Below-normal precipitation is favored over the Aleutians and much of Mainland
Alaska, except the North Slope, under anomalous easterly and northerly flow.
With increased onshore flow ahead of predicted troughing over the North
Pacific, above-normal precipitation is likely for parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies. Probabilities for above-normal precipitation
are enhanced for the Northern Plains and from the Mississippi Valley eastward
to the Atlantic coast, near and ahead of a predicted trough. Below-normal
precipitation probabilities are enhanced over a large area of the western and
central CONUS, extending from the California coast across the Central and
Southern Rockies and the Central and Southern Plains, under predicted ridging
with above-normal mid-level heights. Near-normal precipitation is favored in
climatologically arid regions of the Southwest.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the average large-scale circulation
pattern,
offset by differences among the temperature and precipitation tools, as well
as
a changing circulation pattern during the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 13 - 19 2021

During the week-2 period, the predicted 500-hPa circulation is similar to the
forecast for the 6-10 day period, with some eastward progression of the ridge
and trough over the CONUS and a decrease in amplitude of the overall pattern
with increased uncertainty. A trough is predicted to persist over the North
Pacific, while a ridge pushes into northeastern Mainland Alaska. A ridge and
associated above-normal mid-level heights are predicted to continue over the
western CONUS, while a trough and associated below-normal heights are forecast
over most of the eastern CONUS. Downstream of this trough, a weakening ridge
is
forecast to progress eastward over the Northeast,  leading to near-normal
average mid-level heights.

Below-normal temperatures are favored for southwestern areas of Alaska, under
troughing and anomalous easterly and northerly flow early in the period.
Above-normal temperatures are favored for northeastern Mainland Alaska, under
a
ridge and above-normal mid-level heights. Above-normal mid-level heights lead
to increased probabilities of above-normal temperatures for the western half
of
the CONUS. Near- to below-normal temperatures are favored over most of the
east-central CONUS and Southeast, under a predicted trough and northerly flow.
Positive 500-hPa height anomalies early in the period, along with anomalous
southerly flow, favor above-normal temperatures across the Northeast.

Near- to below-normal precipitation is favored for the Aleutians and most of
interior Mainland Alaska, under a predicted ridge. The trough over the North
Pacific favors enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation for
northern areas of the Pacific Northwest into parts of the northern Rockies and
Intermountain West, due to increased onshore flow. A predicted trough over the
east-central CONUS and potential storm system development leads to enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation for the northeastern CONUS,
consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. As the trough over the
eastern CONUS de-amplifies and progresses eastward, near- to below-normal
precipitation is favored over most of the CONUS, extending from the California
coast across the Central and Southern Rockies into the Great Plains, the
Mississippi Valley, and the Southeast, under and ahead of a mid-level ridge.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, offset
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools, with a changing circulation pattern during the
period.

for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
northeastern Florida through Saturday morning...

...Rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...Southeast cold spell to continue into the weekend as warm air
spreads east from Plains...

A relatively quiet weekend will see brief and focused areas of
hazardous weather over the coming days. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms associated with a strengthening low pressure system
will impact much of Florida through tomorrow afternoon. Excessive
Rainfall leading to Flash Flooding is possible for parts of
northeast Florida, including the Jacksonville metro area, during
this period. Showers and thunderstorms will spread across the
Southeast/Mid-Atlantic coasts this weekend as the low pressure
system brushes up against the region. Multiple inches of rain are
forecast to fall across the Outer Banks of North Carolina on
Sunday. Fortunately, this won't be much of a flash flood threat
for the region. Temperatures will continue to drop as this low
crosses the Florida and peninsula and into the Atlantic. High
temperatures across the Southeast tomorrow and Sunday will be
between 10-25 degrees below average.

Meanwhile, heavy snow is expected over the mountains of the
Pacific Northwest this weekend. Persistent troughing in the
Northwest will lead to low elevation and coastal rain showers as
well as scattered to isolated thunderstorms in the Pacific
Northwest, while heavy snowfall blankets the Olympic and Cascade
mountains through Sunday. Generally 1-2 feet of snow is likely
with isolated amounts exceeding 3 feet, particularly over the
Olympics and highest peaks of the Cascades. Snowfall will then
spread into the Northern Rockies with amounts/impacts likely to be
marginal. Upper-level ridging that is producing above average
temperatures over the Great Plains will drift eastward over the
coming days. Highs may reach 20-25 degrees above normal for parts
of the Central/Northern Plains this weekend, as a result.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The medium range period (Monday-Friday) begins with a
shortwave/upper low exiting the southeast Coast as a deepened
surface low off the East Coast increasingly shifts over the
Atlantic Monday/Tuesday. Behind this, a stable and warm upper
ridge extends from the southern Plains to the Northeast. Out West,
an upper low rotating through the Gulf of Alaska/northeast Pacific
will send a couple shortwave/troughs across the Western U.S.
propagating eastward with time. The models suggest the second
stortwave crossing the West Coast around Tuesday of next week may
amplify over the Central U.S. mid week with possible upper/surface
low development across the Midwest later next week.

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pettern evolution, but plenty of uncertainty
in the details, timing, and strength of systems. Right off the
bat, the GFS is different with the exiting Eastern U.S. trough,
showing more defined northern/southern stream separation and a
stronger/more south surface low well off the Southeast Coast. The
06z GFS is also problematic farther upstream showing a weaker
shortwave crossing the Midwest. Bigger issues/uncertainties arise
late period as troughing amplifies over the Central U.S. with some
guidance showing closed upper low development by Thursday/Friday
next week. Run to run variability suggests models struggle with
whether this is a feature at all, but regardless should bring at
least a defined low pressure system into the Midwest by late next
week.

This set of WPC progs used a general model blend of the latest
deterministic solutions for days 3-4, increasingly blending more
towards the ensemble means later in the period. This helped
mitigate some of those less uncertain details and timing issues,
especially with the late week troughing into the central U.S. and
Midwest. This approach maintains good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The low off the East Coast should present only maritime threats,
though some modestly gusty winds may still be present along the
East Coast on Monday. The first system into the upper Midwest
early in the week may bring some scattered showers to parts of the
Great Lakes/Midwest Tuesday-Wednesday. Meanwhile, the series of
Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with upper
troughing set to work over the Northwest into midweek. This will
highlight periods of terrain enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to central California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades to the Sierra and inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies with a cooling frontal passage.
Amplified upper troughing into the central U.S. is slated to be
sandwiched between upper ridges over the West Coast and East Coast
within an overall pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis would act to favor an emerging lead
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. as theta-e
advection increases. Backside cold air flow also suggests
potential for late next week snows over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest
as moisture feeds back around a developing main low. Please see
WPC links below for all the details.

Initial upper ridging from the southern Plains to Great
Lakes/Northeast should result in modestly above normal highs
Monday-Tuesday (lingering longer over the Northeast). Mean
troughing over the West most of the week should keep temperatures
below normal, with eventually translate downstream towards the
central U.S. by Friday as near to maybe above normal temperatures
move into the West Coast states.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1219 AM CDT Sat Nov 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
The upper-level wave currently in place over the northeastern
Pacific will undergo slight deepening along the Pacific Northwest
coast today, maintaining southwesterly flow over the northern
Rockies. The resulting lee troughing along the northern to central
High Plains will induce a modest wind response over antecedent dry
areas. Morning ensemble guidance suggests sustained winds around 15
mph (gusting to 20-30 mph) will be common from northeast NM
northward into MT and the western Dakotas. Dry conditions are
already in place across the central High Plains after downslope
warming/drying on Friday, and minimal moisture return into the
region today will support areas of low RH down to 15-25%. A few
hours of elevated conditions are probable across much of the central
High Plains this afternoon, but the fire weather threat will mainly
be confined to eastern CO where local reports indicate fine fuels
are dry enough to support a more substantial fire weather risk.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level troughing over the West Coast will begin to slowly shift
eastward through the day Sunday. A leading impulse within the mean
trough is forecast to propagate across the central/northern Rockies,
which will help deepen and consolidate a surface low over the
central High Plains by the afternoon. Pressure-gradient winds are
forecast to increase to around 15-20 mph from northeast NM through
eastern KS. Despite strengthening winds, low-level moisture return
will help mitigate RH reductions across much of OK and KS. A modest
downslope component off the southern/central Rockies coupled with an
antecedent dry air mass may support a few hours of elevated
conditions across northeast NM into adjacent areas of southeast CO
and the OK/TX Panhandles. Forecast guidance has shown reasonable
consistency with this solution, but seasonal ERC values suggest only
marginal fire weather potential. Highlights may be introduced in
subsequent outlooks if fuels become sufficiently dry over the next
48 hours.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

An amplified upper trough/low and deepened surface low offshore
the Southeast should increasingly exit over the Atlantic early
next week as a stable and warm upper ridge extends from the
southern Plains to the East. Meanwhile upstream, an upper low will
rotate through the Gulf of Alaska/northeast Pacific and ejecting
lead shortwaves will traverse the West/Rockies, propagating
eastward through the north-central states to the Northeast in
progressive flow to limit precipitation. Main Pacific upper trough
energy working over the West/Rockies Tuesday into Wednesday is
still then slated to amplify over the central to east-central U.S.
mid-later next week and initiate lead surface cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis in an emerging wet pattern to spread across the
broad region and into the East.

The latest suite of guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably
similar larger scale pettern evolution, but plenty of uncertainty
in the details, timing, and strength of systems. Right off the
bat, the GFS remains different with the exiting Southeastern U.S.
trough, showing more defined northern/southern stream separation
and a stronger/more south surface low well off the coast. Bigger
issues/uncertainties arise later period as troughing amplifies
over the Central U.S. with some guidance showing closed upper low
development by Thursday/Friday next week. Run to run variability
suggests models struggle with this feature, but flow amplitude
should bring at least a defined low pressure system into the
Midwest by late next week.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was primarily
derived from a composite blend of reasonably compatible guidance
from the 18 UTC GEFS mean, 12 UTC ECMWF ensemble mean, the 01 UTC
National Blend of Models and manual adjustments to ensure a bit
more detail consistent in areas with better forecast clustering
broad support. This plan acts to maintain good WPC product
continuity.


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A series of Pacific systems will work inland across the West, with
main upper troughing set to work through the region by midweek.
This will favor terrain enhanced rainfall from the Pacific
Northwest to central California and a heavy snow threat from the
Cascades to the Sierra and inland across favored terrain for the
north-central Great Basin/Rockies with a cooling frontal passage.
Subsequent amplified upper troughing carving out over the central
U.S. is slated to be sandwiched between upper ridges over the West
Coast and East Coast with pattern transition. Cyclogenesis and
frontogenesis would act to favor an emerging lead
rainfall/convective pattern over the east-central U.S. as theta-e
advection increases. Backside cold air flow also suggests
potential for late next week snows over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest
as moisture feeds back around a developing main low. Please see
WPC links below for all the details.

...Periods of heavy rain are possible along the Southeast Coast
through tonight...

...Rain and higher elevation snow over parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies...

...Temperatures will be 10 to 20 degrees below average over the
Southeast and 10 to 25 degrees above average over the
Northern/Central High Plains...

Low pressure just off the northeast coast of Florida will parallel
the Southeast coast pulling moisture in from off the Atlantic.
This will result in periods of heavy rain along portions of the
Carolina Coast tonight. Accordingly, the WPC has issued a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Southeast Coast
through tonight with lingering impacts expected Sunday morning.
The associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.  On Monday, the threat of excessive rainfall ends as the
storm moves farther out over the Atlantic.

Meanwhile, a front over the Northern Rockies will move eastward to
the Upper Great lakes by Monday.  Moisture from the Pacific will
move into the Pacific Northwest aided by an upper-level troughing
bringing rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific
Northwest/Northern California into the Northern Rockies through
Monday.

Ahead of the front southwesterly flow and upper-level ridging will
produce temperatures 10 to 25 degrees above average over the
Northern/Central High Plains through Monday. In contrast, the low
over the Southeast will keep temperatures 10 to 20 degrees below
average, likewise, through Monday.

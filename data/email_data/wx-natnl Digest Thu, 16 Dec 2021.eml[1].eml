Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1009 AM CST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 151700Z - 161200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN
TEXAS PANHANDLE...THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE...AND MUCH OF WESTERN INTO
CENTRAL KANSAS...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...EASTERN COLORADO INTO FAR NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA...FAR SOUTHERN
NEBRASKA...AND MUCH OF KANSAS...

***Dangerous fire-weather outbreak expected across parts of the
central and southern Plains late this morning through this
evening***

The previous forecast remains on track, and no changes were made
with this update. Current visible satellite imagery shows clearing
skies across the central and southern Plains, which will favor deep
boundary-layer mixing amid strong downslope flow across the risk
area. The latest 12Z upper-air data from AMA, DDC, and TOP shows
70-85 mph winds in the lowest 3,000 feet. This intense low-level
flow will support very strong wind gusts and sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds of 40+ mph later this morning into
the evening with RH in the low teens. Of note, the latest surface
observation from Lamar, CO recorded a surface wind gust of 107 mph,
with surrounding observations showing gusts of 70-80 mph. For
additional information on the dangerous fire-weather threat across
parts of the central and southern Plains, see the previous
discussion below.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CST Wed Dec 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Very dangerous wildfire-spread conditions are still expected for
portions of the central Plains today. A 110 kt mid-level jet streak
accompanying a potent mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the
central Plains as an intense surface low quickly ejects into the
Upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon. An impressive vertical wind
profile will accompany the passing low, with widespread 60+ kt
low-level flow (just a few hundred feet above the ground) coinciding
with a mixing boundary layer. Gradient surface flow associated with
this intense low, combined with vertical mixing, will support very
windy and dry conditions atop critically dry fuels (90-98th
percentile ERCs) to support very rapid grassfire spread.

From late morning into mid afternoon, a few hours of widespread 35+
mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds will overlap with
10-15 percent RH. Extremely Critical fire weather highlights remain
in place where confidence is highest in very windy/dry conditions
persisting longer than 3 hours, and where patchy areas of 40+ mph
sustained winds are more likely. East of the Extremely Critical
delineation, high-end Critical to locally Extremely Critical
conditions are likely.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
100 PM EST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 18 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 22 2021

18Z Update:  The 00/06Z deterministic guidance and ensembles are
in very good synoptic scale agreement on Saturday across the
continental U.S., although the 00/12Z UKMET diverges from the
model consensus by Sunday across southern Canada with a much
faster shortwave which becomes out of phase by Monday across the
northern Great Lakes and the Northeast.  This leads to a surface
low well to the east of the other guidance, and thus not favored.
Besides that, model agreement remains decent through Tuesday
before more noteworthy differences become apparent across the
northeast Pacific, with the 06/12Z GFS much stronger with an upper
low dropping south from the Gulf of Alaska by next Wednesday.  One
of the main changes from the overnight forecast issuance is higher
QPF totals across central/northern California for the storm system
early next week, with the potential for an atmospheric river
event.  The WPC fronts and pressures forecast was primarily
derived with a GFS/ECMWF/CMC blend through Monday, followed by
increased use of the GEFS/ECENS means for Tuesday and Wednesday.
The previous discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles remain in good agreement this weekend into
Monday in a pattern with above average forecast confidence and
continuity. Forecast spread and continuity issues become
increasingly evident with the timing of embedded weather features

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A developing frontal low has the potential to bring a swath of
plow-able snow as enhanced by terrain from the upper OH Valley
through especially the interior Northeast this weekend. An
enhanced rainfall focus with the trailing front will meanwhile
sink across the Gulf Coast and Southeast as post-frontal cooling
high pressure builds across the Plains and to the East. Guidance
has been inconsistent with the prospect of subsequent frontal wave
developments and coastal low genesis early next week up the East
Coast in part from northern stream energies and/or with latest
guidance trends now favoring ejection of a separated southern
stream trough that leads to southward suppressed wet lows from the
Gulf to offshore the Southeast.

Well upstream, dynamic but progressive upper trough and surface
system passage will build moisture to support moderate to terrain
enhanced heavy precipitation over the Northwest this weekend.
Amplified upper trough digging over the eastern Pacific early-mid
next week in the wake of this system offers potential to focus
ingredients for moderate to heavy precipitation into north-central
CA with a slow system approaching.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
100 PM EST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Dec 18 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 22 2021

18Z Update:  The 00/06Z deterministic guidance and ensembles are
in very good synoptic scale agreement on Saturday across the
continental U.S., although the 00/12Z UKMET diverges from the
model consensus by Sunday across southern Canada with a much
faster shortwave which becomes out of phase by Monday across the
northern Great Lakes and the Northeast.  This leads to a surface
low well to the east of the other guidance, and thus not favored.
Besides that, model agreement remains decent through Tuesday
before more noteworthy differences become apparent across the
northeast Pacific, with the 06/12Z GFS much stronger with an upper
low dropping south from the Gulf of Alaska by next Wednesday.  One
of the main changes from the overnight forecast issuance is higher
QPF totals across central/northern California for the storm system
early next week, with the potential for an atmospheric river
event.  The WPC fronts and pressures forecast was primarily
derived with a GFS/ECMWF/CMC blend through Monday, followed by
increased use of the GEFS/ECENS means for Tuesday and Wednesday.
The previous discussion is appended below for reference. /Hamrick


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Models and ensembles remain in good agreement this weekend into
Monday in a pattern with above average forecast confidence and
continuity. Forecast spread and continuity issues become
increasingly evident with the timing of embedded weather features
and stream interactions next week. The WPC medium range product

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1224 PM CST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally Elevated and even spotty near-Critical conditions remain
possible across portions of the central and southern High Plains
tomorrow afternoon/Thursday. However, low confidence in a sufficient
spatial/temporal overlap of breezy surface winds and low RH
precludes delineations at this time. Current indications are that
parts of northeastern NM into southeastern CO will have the best
chance of seeing localized fire-weather concerns, where a brief
overlap of 15-20 mph southerly winds and 15-25 percent RH will be
possible. Trends will continue to be monitored for the potential
introduction of Elevated highlights. For additional details, see the
previous discussion below.

..Weinman/Lyons.. 12/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CST Wed Dec 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Modest surface lee-troughing is expected across the central High
Plains tomorrow/Thursday as a mid-level trough impinges on the Rocky
Mountains. Locally Elevated conditions are most likely during the
afternoon, with patchy areas of 15-20 mph sustained southerly winds
coinciding with 20-25 percent RH across northeast New Mexico into
eastern Colorado and far western Kansas. While fuels are expected to
remain extremely dry across the region, confidence in a more
favorable surface wind/RH overlap remains too low to add Elevated
highlights this outlook.

247 PM EST Wed Dec 15 2021

Valid 00Z Thu Dec 16 2021 - 00Z Sat Dec 18 2021

...Extremely powerful storm system to produce a plethora of
weather hazards across the Great Plains and Upper Midwest tonight,
including severe thunderstorms, damaging winds, dangerous fire
weather conditions, and moderate snowfall...

...Heavy snow forecast over the Sierra Nevada through Thursday
morning...

...Heavy rain and instances of flash flooding possible throughout
parts of the Southern Plains, Middle/Lower Mississippi and Ohio
valleys on Thursday and Friday...

The major weather story through tonight and into early Thursday
morning will be associated with a strong, potentially
record-breaking, low pressure system racing across the Upper
Midwest and eventually reaching southern Canada on Thursday. This
robust storm system will create an extremely tight pressure
gradient just to the south of the center and along an attached
cold front. Thus, dangerously high winds are expected to impact
much of the Central and Northern Plains this evening, as well as
the Midwest and Upper Great Lakes overnight. Widespread wind gusts
over 60 mph are forecast and could locally exceed 70 mph. As a
result, blowing dust and power outages will likely be found
throughout the region. Extremely Critical Fire Weather also exists
into this evening from the northern Texas Panhandle to
north-central Kansas. The high winds combined with low relative
humidity will create an environment ripe for any wildfires to
spread rapidly and uncontrollably. Farther north, a line of
potentially severe thunderstorms is likely to develop this
afternoon and swing into Iowa and southern Minnesota. These storms
will have to the potential to produce extreme wind gusts as high
as 100 mph, as well as a strong tornado or two. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Moderate Risk (level 4/5) of severe
weather for this region. Last, but certainly not least, on the
cold side of the system (north and west of the low) snow is likely
to fall across portions of the Dakotas and northern/central
Minnesota tonight. Maximum snowfall amounts may only add up to
around 6 inches, but widespread blowing snow may create hazards
driving conditions. By Thursday, light snow is expected to
continue across the Upper Midwest and Upper Great Lakes into the
late afternoon as gusty winds slowly diminish.

Elsewhere, a frontal system sliding down the West Coast will
funnel moisture into the Sierra Nevada and northern California
mountains through Thursday morning. Snowfall totals over 2 feet
are possible along the Sierra Nevada, where Winter Storm Warnings
have been issued. Snow showers will also spread into the
Intermountain West and Rockies on Thursday and produce moderate
accumulations throughout the high terrain of Nevada, Utah,
Wyoming, and Idaho. For the Northeast, light snow and freezing
rain is forecast to push through northern New England and Maine
tonight before warmer air arrives on Thursday. Winter Weather
Advisories have been issued across Vermont, northern New
Hampshire, and most of Maine to highlight the potential for a few
inches of snow and a glaze of ice.

The next potential weather hazard to monitor towards the end of
the week will likely be located from the Southern Plains to the
Ohio Valley, where a stalled frontal boundary may focus areas of
heavy rain and thunderstorms. Widespread rainfall amounts over one
inch, with local amounts up to 3 inches could occur from eastern
Oklahoma to southern Indiana. This includes much of the region in
western Kentucky that is still cleaning up from the recent tornado
outbreak. Isolated instances of flash flooding are possible,
particularly between northern Arkansas and northern Kentucky.
Here, WPC has issued a Sight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive
Rainfall for Friday. Well above average temperatures are forecast
to engulf much of the eastern and south-central U.S. ahead of the
aforementioned cold front. Widespread highs into the 60s and 70s
will extend over the Southern Plains, Deep South, Tennessee and
Ohio valleys, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic to end the week.
Widespread daily high temperature records are also in jeopardy and
may extend into the Northeast on Thursday, where parts of Upstate
New York and Massachusetts could enjoy highs into the 60s.
Meanwhile, below average temperatures will be confined to the
Intermountain West and Northern Plains. Low temperatures are
expected to dip into the single digits on Thursday and Friday,
with subzero temperatures found across northern Montana and North
Dakota.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 21 - 25 2021

There is very good agreement among the dynamical models regarding an amplif=
ied
500-hPa geopotential height pattern across the forecast domain. A very high
amplitude ridge and associated positive 500-hPa height anomalies are foreca=
st
over the North Pacific extending northward into the Bering Sea. There is a
slight retrogression of this ridge relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day
forecasts.
Ensemble model solutions from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian depict a  high
amplitude trough extending from western Canada into the eastern Pacific Oce=
an
near the west coast of the CONUS. Ridging and positive 500-hPa height
anomalies
are forecast from parts of the Southwest across the Southern and Central
Plains
and parts of the East, excluding most of the Northeast and parts of the
eastern
coast, where near to below normal heights are favored.

Above normal temperatures are favored over the western Aleutians under the
predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal
temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle under forecast anomalous mid-level northerly flow and easterly
low-level flow from western Canada. Below normal temperatures are favored f=
or
most of the western CONUS eastward across the Northern Rockies and Northern
Plains to the western Great Lakes region, under negative 500-hPa height
anomalies associated with the predicted trough. Near to below normal
temperatures are likely for parts of the Northeast under forecast below nor=
mal
heights. Near to above normal temperatures are favored for the rest of the
CONUS, with the highest probability (exceeding 80%) over the Southern High
Plains under a predicted ridge and also consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

Onshore flow favors above normal precipitation for northern Mainland Alaska=
,
although precipitation anomalies are predicted to be small. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the south coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle
under anomalous northerly mid-level flow ahead of the ridge. Above normal
precipitation is favored for most of the western third of the CONUS, as wel=
l
as
for parts of the Northern Plains and western Great Lakes region, ahead of a=
n
amplified trough. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the res=
t
of
the CONUS underneath forecast above normal 500-hPa heights and also support=
ed
by the precipitation consolidation tool.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=

0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good model agreement on the circulation forecast over North America, a=
nd
good agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools, offset by som=
e
disagreement among the forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 23 - 29 2021

A similar 500-hPa flow pattern to the 6-10 day period forecast is predicted=
 to
continue into week 2 with some de-amplification of the predicted circulatio=
n
patterns and a slight eastward progression over the forecast domain.

Near to below normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle under anomalous northerly flow. Under the amplifying
trough and below normal 500-hPa height anomalies, below normal temperature
probabilities are enhanced over the far western CONUS and across the northe=
rn
tier into the Upper Mississippi Valley. Probabilities exceed 80% for parts =
of
the Northern High Plains. Above normal temperatures are likely for most of =
the
remaining areas of the CONUS, under positive 500-hPa height anomalies, with
probabilities exceeding 80% over parts of the Southern Great Plains, while
near
to below normal temperatures are favored for parts of the Northeast under
negative 500-hPa height anomalies.

Above normal precipitation continues to be slightly favored for parts of th=
e
northern Alaska Mainland in week 2. Below normal precipitation is favored f=
or
the southern Alaska Mainland and the Alaska Panhandle, under anomalous
northerly mid-level flow. Above normal precipitation is favored for the
western
third of the CONUS, with probabilities exceeding 60% in parts of western
Nevada, as the trough is predicted to amplify. Above normal precipitation i=
s
slightly favored for parts of the Northern Plains and parts of the Midwest,
while below normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Southern and
Central Plains, through the southern Mid-Atlantic and Southeast, supported =
by
the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
very good agreement on an amplified 500-hPa circulation pattern, and good
agreement among the temperature and precipitation tools over most of the
forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

FOR THURSDAY DECEMBER 23 - WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 29: There is good agreement
among
the dynamical models featuring highly amplified ridging over the northern
Pacific, with downstream negative mid-level height departures over the east=
ern
Pacific and into the western and north-central CONUS. At the surface, ensem=
ble
guidance favors the persistence of a broad area of surface high pressure ov=
er
western Canada, extending into eastern Alaska, which is expected to advect
anomalous cold air into the northwestern and north-central CONUS and
southeastern Alaska during the period. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depict a broad region from the Pacific Northwest to the Upper Mississippi
Valley of at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 1=
5th
percentile and below freezing, thus a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is issued for the entirety of week-2. Higher probabilities (>4=
0%)
for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below 0 degr=
ees
F are indicated along the Canadian border region extending from Montana to
North Dakota during the middle of the period, supporting the continuation o=
f
moderate risk of much below normal temperatures from Dec 24 to 27 for the
region. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs forecast tools also support the i=
ntroduction of a high risk
of
much below normal temperatures across northern Montana and extreme
northwestern
North Dakota from Dec 24 to 26, where there are increased probabilities (>6=
0%)
for minimum temperatures to fall below the 15th percentile and 0 degrees F,
with localized increased chances (>40%) of minimum temperatures falling bel=
ow
-20 degrees F along the Canadian border. In Alaska, the forecast ridge/trou=
gh
pattern over the North Pacific is expected to bring anomalously cold
temperatures, with an increased likelihood for much below normal temperatur=
es
over the southeastern Mainland and Panhandle. Reforecast tools indicate at
least a 60% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentil=
e
across portions of the lower Panhandle, thus a corresponding high risk area
for
much below normal temperatures Dec 24 to 26. A moderate risk of much below
normal temperatures remains posted across the Panhandle and extends to Yaku=
tat
Dec 23 to 27, and a broader slight risk area remains issued and now extends
from the Kenai Peninsula, northeastward to the Yukon Flats, and through the
Panhandle for the entirety of week-2.



Compared to yesterday, a slight retrogression (i.e. westward displacement) =
of
the amplified ridge/trough pattern over the North Pacific continues today.
Additionally, these ensemble runs also favor stronger anomalous mid-level
ridging over the Southern Tier of the CONUS. The westward movement of this
feature in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model guidance continues to in=
crease chances for onshore
flow across much of the West Coast. A moderate risk for heavy precipitation
remains issued for central and southern California, but is expanded northwa=
rd
today to include the Sacramento Valley and surrounding ranges for Dec 23-26=
.
The slight risk area remains posted Dec 23-28 extending from southern
California into the Pacific Northwest where reforecast guidance now shows
higher chances for 3-day amounts exceeding 2 inches throughout the period.



As supported by the latest deterministic and ensemble mean solutions, there=
 is
also an elevated potential for high elevation snowfall across much of the
western U.S. A moderate risk of heavy snow is posted for the Sierra Nevada
Mountains and Klamath Basin in northern and central California for Dec 23-2=
6,
and a broader slight risk area is posted extending northward into the Casca=
des
of the Pacific Northwest Dec 23-28. A slight risk of heavy snow is also iss=
ued
across northern Idaho and the Bitterroot Mountains of the northern Rockies =
for
much of week-2 (Dec 23-28), where there is increased support in today's
guidance for snowfall totals reaching hazard thresholds for the week as a
whole. The overall increase in available moisture across the West during
week-2
is expected to help the ongoing drought recovery (much of California is sti=
ll
registering D3 to D4 conditions); however, enhanced precipitation may trigg=
er
localized flooding in the lower elevation areas and may also lead to added
travel difficulties during the upcoming holidays.



Strong surface pressure gradients featured in the ensembles as well as
elevated
chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile in the ECMWF
reforecast tool throughout much of the West supports the addition of slight
risk of high winds Dec 23-28. This area was expanded to include southern
portions of Front Range and Southern High Plains regions, as the ECMWF
reforecast tool indicates a >20% chance of exceeding the 85th percentile
across
those areas as well, with enhanced chances (>40%) of exceeding the 85th
percentile across the Southern High Plains during the middle third of the
period. Above normal temperatures and high winds have exacerbated drought
conditions throughout these areas in recent months, further warranting the
expansion of the slight risk area.



Across the southern and eastern CONUS, persistent mid-level ridging is like=
ly
to lead to a relatively drier and warmer pattern during week-2. Additionall=
y,
the mid-level pattern is favored to become more zonal across the lower 48
toward the end of week-2, indicating a more progressive pattern with the
potential for a shift toward more troughing in the eastern CONUS.

potential Southeast U.S. coastal low development and proximity.

The WPC medium range product suite was derived from a composite of
well clustered solutions from the 18 UTC GFS, the 12 UTC
ECWMF/UKMET/Canadian and the 01 UTC National Blend of Models Days
3-5 (Sun-Tue). This solution offers good WPC continuity and has
favorable ensemble support. Switched focus to the still compatible
ensemble means into days 6/7 amid growing system uncertainty and
run to run variances. Latest 00 UTC guidance overall remains in
line with this forecast plan.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern stream upper trough passage and an exiting frontal low
may support some lingering snows Sun over northern New England and
off the lower Great Lakes. Locally enhanced rain should focus with
waves along a trailing/stalling front sunk through the Gulf Coast
and Southeast into early next week. Guidance has become better
clustered with approach of a separted/amplified southern stream
shortwave, but still offers less than stellar run to run
continuity into next midweek with the depth and coastal proximity
of a potentially well organized Southeast U.S. coastal low and
inland extent for enhanced wrapped rains. Manually adjusted WPC
progs show a decent coastal low offshore given favorable but
steadily progressive upper trough support and improving guidance
signal.

Upper trough and surface system passage will support lingering
terrain enhanced precipitation over the Northwest Sun. Details
remain less certain upstream over the eastern Pacific, but there
remains a good guicance signal that amplified upper trough digging
early-mid next week would offers potential to focus ingredients
for moderate to heavy precipitation for north-central CA
considering slow system approach, developing moisture plume
approach and favored southern facing terrain enhancement. Some
heavier model qpf solutions within the full envelope of solutions
would better portend local runoff issues.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CST Thu Dec 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface lee troughing will intensify across the central High Plains
as a mid-level trough approaches the central CONUS. Modestly dry and
breezy conditions will develop during the afternoon, with some
threat for fire spread apparent. Despite cool temperatures and RH
struggling to dip below 20 percent, widespread 15+ mph sustained
southerly winds atop extremely dry fuels will foster at least
low-end Elevated conditions by afternoon peak heating.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0137 AM CST Thu Dec 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will eject into the Plains states
tomorrow/Friday, with a surface cold front expected to sag southward
across the central U.S. In the post-cold frontal environment, a
window of dry and breezy conditions amid 50+ F surface temperatures
may develop across portions of the central High Plains, where fuels
are expected to remain extremely dry and very conducive to fire
spread. Similar to Day 1, RH may struggle to dip below 20 percent
along the Colorado/Kansas border eastward. However, widespread 15+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds should compensate to
support a low-end Elevated wildfire-spread threat given the
extremely dry fuels.

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower Mississippi Valleys through Friday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Ohio, Tennessee, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys, and Southern
Plains on Friday into Saturday morning...

...Heavy snow over the Sierra Nevada Mountains will wind down on
Thursday; Chance of freezing rain over parts of the Upper Midwest
and Northern New England early on Thursday...

...Temperatures will be 20 to 30 degrees above average for the
Lower Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes/Ohio Valley, into the
Northeast...

An area of deep low pressure over Central Ontario will produce
high winds over the Upper Midwest into the Great Lakes. Therefore,
High Wind Warnings are issued over the region, with Storm Warnings
over Lakes Michigan, Superior, and parts of Lake Huron. Light snow
and rain will develop over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley
and Upper Great Lakes, with isolated pockets of rain/freezing rain
along the rain-snow line. The rain will change over to all snow on
Thursday afternoon, ending overnight Thursday with light lake
effect snow downwind from Lake Superior on Friday.  Furthermore,
rain in the Great Lakes will move into the Northeast, with light
snow developing over parts of Northern New England. As warm air
moves over the region, cold air will get trapped in the valleys
and produce areas of freezing rain over parts of Northern New
England through Thursday evening.

The Associated strong cold front extending from the Great Lakes
southwestward to the Southern Plains will move eastward off the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Coast by Friday afternoon.  Showers and
thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the front from the
Ohio Western Valley to the Southern Plains. The risk of severe
thunderstorms is marginal.  However, the associated heavy rain
will  impact the area. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal
Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower Mississippi Valleys through Friday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create localized areas of flash flooding,
affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy rain.

As moisture pools along the boundary, the risk of excessive
rainfall increases on Friday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms over
the Ohio, Tennessee, Middle/Lower Mississippi Valleys, and
Southern Plains on Friday into Saturday morning.  The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.
Moreover, ahead of the front, temperatures will be 20 to 30
degrees above average for the Lower Mississippi Valley, Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley, into the Northeast. In addition, many
record-high temperatures are forecast over parts of the Ohio
Valley into the Northeast.

In the meantime, a front onshore over the Northwest will move
southward over the West Coast and dissipate by Thursday evening,
as the associated upper-level energy moves inland to the Rockies
by Friday and to the Upper Midwest by Saturday.   The system will
produce coastal rain and higher elevation snow over the Pacific
Northwest and Northern/Central California. Rain will move into
parts of Southern California by Thursday evening.  The rain and
snow wind down overnight Thursday over the Pacific Northwest and
California. Concurrently, snow will move into parts of the
Northern/Central Rockies and the Northern High plains by Friday
morning and into the Northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley
overnight Friday.

Meanwhile, a wave of low pressure will develop over parts of the
Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley by Friday evening. The
low moves into the Western Ohio Valley by Saturday morning.  The
system will produce light snow over parts of the Great Lakes and
rain from the Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic by Saturday
morning.

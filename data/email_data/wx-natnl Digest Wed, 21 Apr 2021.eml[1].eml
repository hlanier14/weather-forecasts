Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1002 AM CDT Tue Apr 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

The forecast remains on track. Conditions in the northern Sacramento
Valley may approach elevated criteria very late in the forecast
period. Favorable along-valley mid-level winds will combined with a
maximized surface pressure gradient to increase winds. Low RH is
questionable beyond very localized pockets of around 20%.
Furthermore, precipitation is possible along with the shortwave
trough which complicates fine fuel status in the Valley.

..Wendt.. 04/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1240 AM CDT Tue Apr 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact mid-level shortwave trough will become more amplified
through the period as it drops southeastward through California. Lee
cyclogenesis is expected in Nevada which will tighten the surface
pressure gradient across portions of the Southwest and Great Basin.
This tightening pressure gradient and downward transport of
mid-level flow amid deep mixing will lead to some windy conditions
across portions of central Arizona with winds of 15 to 20 mph. In
addition, very dry surface relative humidity is forecast in the
single digits. These conditions warrant an elevated fire weather
delineation across mostly central Arizona.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 20 2021

SYNOPSIS: A transient mid-level height pattern is forecast for week-2 across
North America. The most significant feature is predicted to be mid-level low
pressure moving through the central and eastern lower-48 early in the period,
which is favored to bring enhanced precipitation chances to portions of the
east-central U.S. Otherwise, minimal amplification and near normal heights
over
most of the domain favor decreased chances for prolonged hazardous weather
during the period.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for portions of the Middle and Lower
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, the Southeast, and the Southern
Appalachians, Wed-Thu, Apr 28-29.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the Great Plains, Wed, Apr 28.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR WEDNESDAY APRIL 28 - TUESDAY MAY 04: Dynamical model guidance from the 6z
GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensemble depict mid-level shortwave troughing moving through
the central CONUS early in the period, with associated surface low pressure
tracking across the Upper Midwest. At the same time, surface high pressure is
forecast over the western Atlantic. This favors enhanced southerly flow across
much of the east-central CONUS, leading to increased chances for heavy
precipitation over the region as the surface low moves through. Todays
guidance is less robust compared to yesterday in terms of the coverage in
elevated probabilities for hazardous precipitation. The ECMWF reforecast tool
indicates at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation totals exceeding the
85th percentile for the first part of the period across the eastern third of
the CONUS. The GEFS reforecast tool, however, only depicts limited coverage of
these enhanced probabilities over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley.
Uncalibrated guidance from both tools depict greater coverage of heavy rain
associated with a frontal boundary forecast to move across the southeastern
quadrant of the CONUS. As a result, a slight risk for heavy precipitation is
highlighted across portions of the Middle and Lower, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys, the Southeast, and the Southern Appalachians for Apr 28-29 where
24-hour rainfall totals may exceed 1 inch.



Additional heavy precipitation is possible closer to the low pressure center
over portions of the Great Lakes and Upper Mississippi Valley on or near the
28th, with uncalibrated guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depicting
24-hour totals of around a half inch. This would likely not result in any
significant impacts, and given the reduced probabilities in the reforecast
tools compared to yesterday, the hazard is removed for these areas. The
frontal
system is then forecast to move across the Eastern Seaboard, but is predicted
to weaken as the surface low moves into southern Canada. Although some rain
can
be expected along the East Coast as the front moves through, hazardous
rainfall
is unlikely, and therefore the heavy precipitation hazard is not extended
eastward.



Increased wind speeds are possible across portions of the Great Plains on the
backside of the aforementioned surface low. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools depict parts of these regions having at least a 20% chance of sustained
wind speeds exceeding 25-mph, and therefore a slight risk for high winds is
highlighted for Apr 28. The last several runs of the deterministic GFS depict
the potential for northerly wind speeds in the 30-40 mph range with higher
gusts. A fairly robust low level jet is forecast to accompany the surface low
as it moves across the central CONUS, and this may bring increased wind speeds
to areas further east. However, there is uncertainty whether these high winds
mix down, as the forecast surface wind speeds in both models look modest at
best. For this reason, the wind hazard is not extended spatially, but the
potential for gusty winds is noted across the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
Valleys as the surface low moves by given the tight pressure gradient forecast
to be in place.



Elsewhere across North America, the transient synoptic pattern reduces the
chances of hazardous weather. Increased Pacific flow and atmospheric river
activity may increase the chances for heavy precipitation across portions of
the West Coast of the CONUS, but none of the guidance tools depict rainfall
totals reaching predetermined hazards criteria. Unseasonably warm temperatures
are possible across portions of south Texas, with some areas near the
Texas/Mexico border possibly experiencing temperatures in the upper 90s along
with elevated dew points resulting in heat indices over 100 deg F. However,
these temperatures, although hot, are not expected to have any significant
impacts for the region, and therefore no related temperature hazard is
highlighted. Weak mid-level flow is favored across Alaska resulting in a
generally dry pattern through the period. This should at least limit
additional
water being added to the hydrological system during river break up season.

...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South Friday into
this Weekend...

...Overview...

Two moderately progressive upper troughs will affect the lower 48,
between a blocky high-latitude regime featuring Alaska/Greenland
ridges plus a broad upper low over central-western Canada, and a
Greater Antilles ridge that eventually builds into southern
Mexico. The leading surface system will track from the southern
High Plains through the mid-South before turning the corner near
the coast as a nor'easter Sunday-Monday. Upper ridging will build
in behind this system as the upstream Pacific system moves into
and through the West during the first part of next week with low
pressure reaching the Plains by Tuesday. Aside from an area of
warmth ahead of the Pacific/western system, the pattern will be
rather chilly for late April with heaviest precipitation focused
over the South/East with the leading system and the West with the
feature emerging from the Pacific.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The system tracking out of the southern High Plains and expected
to develop into a nor'easter still exhibits fine-scale shortwave
sensitivity that may temper confidence in specifics for a time.
There is improving consensus toward recent ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs
that have depicted formation of an upper low over New England
and/or the Canadian Maritimes by early next week. However spread
persists for the open shortwave that crosses the central/southern
U.S. and separate northern tier U.S./southern Canada energy that
will likely provide the greater input for the closed low. Precise
timing of closed low formation and the track will affect
precipitation coverage and amounts over New England. Overall
prefer a compromise approach with more ECMWF/GFS weighting
relative to the strong/inland 00Z UKMET and farther offshore 00Z
CMC. The 00Z ECMWF mean fit in with this idea a lot better than
the weak and suppressed 06Z GEFS mean. The 00Z GEFS mean was
closer to consensus so that run provided the minority GEFS input
for the forecast. 12Z model runs thus far maintain general support
for aforementioned preferences.

Models and ensembles have maintained better than average
clustering for the Pacific upper trough that reaches the West
early in the week and brings a fairly strong low pressure system
into the Plains by next Tuesday. The main trend over the past
24-36 hours has been for the GFS to trend a little faster with the
upper trough, though a slower trend in the new 12Z ECMWF shows
there may still be some shuffling of specifics even though the
overall feature exhibits better than average confidence. A blend
of operational guidance followed by some ensemble input along with
the 06 GFS/00Z ECMWF/00Z CMC late in the period represented
consensus well for this system.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rainfall will expand and intensify across the South from Friday
into Saturday as low pressure tracks out of the southern High
Plains. The leading warm front will interact with Gulf of Mexico
moisture and instability, likely producing areas of heavy
rainfall. Runoff and flooding issues are quite possible,
especially in areas that have received much above normal rainfall
this month. Currently expect the axis of highest rainfall to
extend from southern Arkansas/northern Louisiana into South
Carolina. There will be potential for severe weather as well so
check Storm Prediction Center outlooks for the latest information.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens. A little snow at
highest elevations could be possible depending on exactly how the
system evolves.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focus from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley.

A chilly air mass Friday over the East and especially northern
High Plains (where highs will be 10-20F below normal) will
moderate some this weekend but there will still be decent coverage
of below normal highs over the eastern half of the country. An
area of above normal temperatures over parts of the West/Great
Basin ahead of the Pacific upper trough/low will shift eastward
across the Rockies and into the Plains by next week. Best
potential for one or more days with temperatures 10F or more above
normal will extend from near the Great Basin through the
central-southern Rockies into the Plains/Midwest. Trailing the
front that crosses the West, temperatures over the region will
decline to 5-15F colder than normal by next Monday-Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 26 - 30 2021

Todays model solutions are in fair agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
geopotential height pattern forecast across North America and adjacent ocean
areas during the 6-10 day period. A shortwave trough is predicted to move
eastward over the CONUS, while anomalous ridging with positive 500-hPa
anomalies is forecast over the Bering Sea. Today's manual 500-hPa height blend
weights the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble mean slightly greater than the Canadian
ensemble means, due to recent model skill. The resultant manual blend features
near normal heights and zonal flow over much of the CONUS. Above normal 500-
hPa
heights are forecast over western Mainland Alaska, while below normal 500-hPa
heights are expected over eastern Mainland Alaska.

Probabilities for below normal temperatures are elevated across the Pacific
Northwest, California, western Nevada, western Arizona, and parts of the
Northern Great Basin and Northern Rockies. Above normal temperature
probabilities are favored over most of the central and eastern CONUS except
for
eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota, where below normal temperatures
are indicated, consistent with the operational autoblend forecast tool. Above
normal temperature probabilities are increased across much of Alaska, under
the
anomalous ridging.

Above normal precipitation is favored over the Pacific Northwest, northern
California, parts of the Northern and Central Great Basin due to the potential
emergence of shortwave troughs ahead of a longwave trough offshore of the West
Coast. Chances of below normal precipitation are enhanced across parts of the
Central and Southern Rockies, the Central and Southern Plains, while above
normal precipitation is more likely over the Mississippi Valley, the Upper
Great Lakes, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and the Southeast, consistent
with
operational Autoblend and ERF Consolidation tools. Also, a shortwave trough
and
associated low pressure system are forecast to track through these areas
during
the 6-10 day period. Below normal precipitation is favored across Alaska,
supported by the GEFS and ECMWF Calibrated Reforecast tools.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 28 - MAY 04, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in fair agreement on the
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous troughing with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast south of the
Gulf of Alaska, while progressive flow is expected throughout the CONUS.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend weights the ECMWF ensemble mean greater
than the GEFS and Canadian ensemble means, due to recent model skill. The
resultant manual blend features near normal heights over much of the CONUS and
Alaska.

The progressive flow in a variable temperature pattern favors near or above
normal temperatures for much of the CONUS. Probabilities for below normal
temperatures are slighlty elevated across parts of the Middle Mississippi
Valley, supported by the GEFS Calibrated reforecast tool. Above normal
temperatures are favored over Alaska, consistent with GEFS and ECENS
Calibrated
refrecast tools.

Chances of below normal precipitation are enhanced across parts of the
Southern
Plains and the Four Corners Region, while near to above normal precipitation
is
favored over the remainder of the CONUS, consistent with operational Autoblend
and ECENS calibrated reforecast tool. Below normal precipitation is more
likely
across Alaska, supported by GEFS and ECENS calibrated refrecast tools.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
fair model agreement with some disagreement among the the temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE LOWER COLORADO
RIVER VALLEY...

Slight adjustments were made to the Critical area across parts of
the Lower Colorado River Valley to reflect the latest guidance
consensus. Several guidance members continue to indicate Extremely
Critical meteorological surface conditions across parts of northern
Arizona. However, fuels are not extremely critically dry, precluding
an Extremely Critical upgrade. The Elevated area across the
Southeast was expanded south-southwestward to include much of
central into eastern Georgia. Latest guidance shows wind reaching up
to 15 mph across this region by afternoon peak heating, when RH is
expected to dip into the 20-25% range. Given the anticipated
favorable meteorological surface conditions supporting fire spread
in Georgia, Elevated fire weather highlights were introduced despite
the mediocre receptiveness of fuels.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track for the Northern
Plains and northern California. Please see the previous forecast for
more details.

..Squitieri.. 04/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1241 AM CDT Tue Apr 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a strong mid-level jet streak will round the base of
an amplifying mid-level trough and overspread much of Arizona. At
the surface, lee cyclogenesis is expected to continue with a ~1000mb
surface low located somewhere in the southern Great Basin by
Wednesday evening. Farther east, a strong surface low will deepen as
it moves up the East Coast with a cold front trailing along the
coast through the day Wednesday. Strong northwesterly winds will
develop in the wake of this cold front along much of the East Coast.

...Southwest...
Strong surface winds are expected to begin early in the day across
portions of Arizona in response to the strengthening pressure
gradient. However, these winds will strengthen further through the
day as heating leads to deep mixing above 3km AGL. The strongest
winds are expected in north-central Arizona where the core of the
50+ mph mid-level jet streak is forecast to track and where
elevation will make them more susceptible to strong winds. In fact,
extremely critical meteorological conditions are expected with winds
in excess of 30 mph and relative humidity in the single digits.
However, fuels in this area, while dry, are not extremely dry
despite ongoing drought conditions. Therefore, no extremely critical
area is warranted.

...Northern California...
On the northwest side of the surface low, the strengthening pressure
gradient and valley parallel deep layer flow amid deep mixing may
lead to some elevated fire weather conditions in northern portions
of the Central Valley.

...Northern Plains...
Some locally elevated conditions are possible in northern Montana
and North Dakota Wednesday afternoon. It appears more widespread
elevated conditions will remain north of the border, but an hour or
two of winds in excess of 15 mph and relative humidity of 15 to 20
percent is possible.

...Eastern Carolinas...
Breezy northwesterly conditions are expected across much of the
eastern seaboard on Wednesday in the wake of a cold front which will
move through the region. Most guidance keeps the frontal passage
dry. ERC values are still low across Georgia, but ERCs are above the
90th percentile in the eastern Carolinas with some areas above the
97th percentile. Similarly dry and breezy conditions are anticipated
in eastern Virginia, but there is a better chance for precipitation
as the front passes through this region. Winds are expected to be 15
to 20 mph with relative humidity of 25 to 35 percent.

...Heavy Rainfall/Flooding Threat across the South Friday into
this Weekend...

...Overview...

Two moderately progressive upper troughs will affect the lower 48,
between a blocky high-latitude regime featuring Alaska/Greenland
ridges plus a broad upper low over central-western Canada, and a
Greater Antilles ridge that eventually builds into southern
Mexico. The leading surface system will track from the southern
High Plains through the mid-South before turning the corner near
the coast as a nor'easter Sunday-Monday. Upper ridging will build
in behind this system as the upstream Pacific system moves into
and through the West during the first part of next week with low
pressure reaching the Plains by Tuesday. Aside from an area of
warmth ahead of the Pacific/western system, the pattern will be
rather chilly for late April with heaviest precipitation focused
over the South/East with the leading system and the West with the
feature emerging from the Pacific.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The system tracking out of the southern High Plains and expected
to develop into a nor'easter still exhibits fine-scale shortwave
sensitivity that may temper confidence in specifics for a time.
There is improving consensus toward recent ECMWF/ECMWF mean runs
that have depicted formation of an upper low over New England
and/or the Canadian Maritimes by early next week. However spread
persists for the open shortwave that crosses the central/southern
U.S. and separate northern tier U.S./southern Canada energy that
will likely provide the greater input for the closed low. Precise
timing of closed low formation and the track will affect
precipitation coverage and amounts over New England. Overall
prefer a compromise approach with more ECMWF/GFS weighting
relative to the strong/inland 00Z UKMET and farther offshore 00Z
CMC. The 00Z ECMWF mean fit in with this idea a lot better than
the weak and suppressed 06Z GEFS mean. The 00Z GEFS mean was
closer to consensus so that run provided the minority GEFS input
for the forecast. 12Z model runs thus far maintain general support
for aforementioned preferences.

Models and ensembles have maintained better than average
clustering for the Pacific upper trough that reaches the West
early in the week and brings a fairly strong low pressure system
into the Plains by next Tuesday. The main trend over the past
24-36 hours has been for the GFS to trend a little faster with the
upper trough, though a slower trend in the new 12Z ECMWF shows
there may still be some shuffling of specifics even though the
overall feature exhibits better than average confidence. A blend
of operational guidance followed by some ensemble input along with
the 06 GFS/00Z ECMWF/00Z CMC late in the period represented
consensus well for this system.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Rainfall will expand and intensify across the South from Friday
into Saturday as low pressure tracks out of the southern High
Plains. The leading warm front will interact with Gulf of Mexico
moisture and instability, likely producing areas of heavy
rainfall. Runoff and flooding issues are quite possible,
especially in areas that have received much above normal rainfall
this month. Currently expect the axis of highest rainfall to
extend from southern Arkansas/northern Louisiana into South
Carolina. There will be potential for severe weather as well so
check Storm Prediction Center outlooks for the latest information.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens. A little snow at
highest elevations could be possible depending on exactly how the
system evolves.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focus from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley.

A chilly air mass Friday over the East and especially northern
High Plains (where highs will be 10-20F below normal) will
moderate some this weekend but there will still be decent coverage
of below normal highs over the eastern half of the country. An
area of above normal temperatures over parts of the West/Great
Basin ahead of the Pacific upper trough/low will shift eastward
across the Rockies and into the Plains by next week. Best
potential for one or more days with temperatures 10F or more above
normal will extend from near the Great Basin through the
central-southern Rockies into the Plains/Midwest. Trailing the
front that crosses the West, temperatures over the region will
decline to 5-15F colder than normal by next Monday-Tuesday.

...Snow is expected to spread quickly from the Central U.S. to the
Midwest today, and then across northern New England on Wednesday
into Thursday...

...Subfreezing record cold temperatures expected across much of
the south-central U.S. Wednesday morning, shifting to parts of the
eastern U.S. Thursday morning...

...Critical fire weather threat over Arizona through Friday...

Late season snow event continues to spread eastward across the
Ozarks into the Ohio Valley as a developing area of low pressure
is forecast to race along the Alleghenies into the Northeast later
today into tomorrow morning. As the low pressure system progresses
northeastward, rain and mixed precipitation will continue to
envelop the Midwest, before a swath of wet snow falls along the
Canadian border from New York into Northern New England beginning
Wednesday morning through Friday. 6 to locally 8 inches is
possible along the border through Friday. As such, "Moderate"
impacts are expected in these locations from snow-load, per the
Weather Prediction Center Winter Storm Severity Index, and Winter
Weather Advisories are in effect for the region. Further south in
the Mid-Atlantic, some rain and a few rumbles of thunder are
possible as the storm moves through.

In the wake of the developing storm system, a bout of unseasonably
cold air is forecast to spill into the Central U.S. today and
tomorrow, leading to widespread freeze and frost concerns tonight
across the central/southern Plains and the Midwest. Freeze Watches
and Warnings extend continuously from north-central Michigan into
central Texas. Numerous daily record low temperatures are forecast
to be tied or broken on Wednesday morning as temperatures dip to
below freezing, around 20-25 degrees below average for late April.
Residents in these areas are encouraged to take preventative
measures to mitigate the impacts of sub-freezing temperatures on
vulnerable vegetation if possible. By Friday, the frigid airmass
will moderate as it drifts east, although low temperatures will
remain around 10 degrees below normal in the Central U.S., with
lows hovering in the mid-30's to 40's.

Meanwhile, active weather across Florida has been edging very
slowly southward into southern Florida ahead of a slow-moving
front. A low pressure wave forming on the front could bring
additional heavy showers and thunderstorms today across central
Florida. Improving conditions should begin Wednesday morning as
the wave moves off into the Atlantic and rain chances decrease
across southern Florida. While excessive rain may be problematic
in Florida, dry, windy conditions will set the stage for a fire
weather threat in Arizona over the next three days as low pressure
deepens in the region. Accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center
has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather today, and a Critical
Risk tomorrow, with the potential for additional impactful fire
weather also highlighted on Friday.

254 AM EDT Wed Apr 21 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 24 2021 - 12Z Wed Apr 28 2021

...Heavy Rainfall across parts of the Southeast Saturday...

...Overview...

Blocky flow at the higher latitudes will yield quasi-progressive
flow across the mid-latitudes/CONUS during the medium range. Both
northern and southern stream systems will flow across the lower 48
with the potential for some merging/phasing near New England late
this weekend and over the central Plains next week. This may lead
to bouts of heavy rain over the Southeast Saturday and possible
coastal New England Sunday, with additional rain/snow into the
West Sunday-Monday. Temperatures will be variable during the
period, modulated by frontal passages.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

Through the 12Z/18Z (20th) guidance, the deterministic guidance
offered a reasonably-clustered starting point with differences
noted in the pace of the eastern system this weekend and,
increasingly, the speed of the trough pushing through the West. In
the East, a blended solution sufficed as multi-day trends have
been stable in the ECMWF ensembles (quicker trend in the GEFS
after mishandling the lead-in trough through the South). To the
West, the 12Z ECMWF was notable slower with the trough through
California compared to much of the rest of the guidance, though
this may have been an odd run with the guidance due to a steady
narrowing of the guidance the past few days. Opted to maintain the
previous preference which is mostly around the 12Z ECMWF ensemble
mean, but with a minority weighting toward the quicker guidance.
By next Wed, differences actually narrowed as the system lifts
through the central states and develops surface low pressure in
the Plains to the Upper Midwest.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Low pressure in the Tennessee Valley early Saturday will promote
shower and storms, possibly severe (see SPC), with locally heavy
rain especially over parts of Georgia and through the Carolinas.
The system should then lift up the East Coast as trailing northern
stream energy from the Great Lakes region merges into the coastal
system and possibly closes an upper low. Enhanced rainfall is
possible from parts of the Mid-Atlantic into New England with
windy conditions region-wide as the low deepens. A little snow at
highest elevations could be possible depending on exactly how the
system evolves.

In the West, an amplifying Pacific upper trough/low and surface
front will work into the West during the weekend into early next
week. This system will spread lower elevation rain/mountain snow
focused from the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies southward
into California and the Great Basin/central Rockies. The highest
totals with this system will likely be from the Pacific Northwest
into the Sierra Nevada. The majority of precipitation should be
light to moderate though parts of the central West Coast and
Sierra Nevada could see a period of locally enhanced activity.
Once the system moves to the Plains by Tuesday, potential will
increase for convectively-driven rainfall over parts of the Plains
and Mississippi Valley. See SPC for details on any severe weather
threat.

In the wake of the eastern system, cooler than normal temperatures
will be prevalent over the Ohio Valley and southern Mid-Atlantic
into the Northeast. An area of above normal temperatures over
parts of the West/Great Basin ahead of the Pacific upper
trough/low will shift eastward across the Rockies and into the
Plains by early next week and into the Northeastern 1/4 of the
CONUS by midweek. Best potential for one or more days with
temperatures 10F or more above normal will extend from near the
Great Basin through the central-southern Rockies into the
Plains/Midwest where temperatures may climb well into the 80s/70s,
respectively. Trailing the front that crosses the West,
temperatures over the region will decline to 5-15F colder than
normal by next Monday-Tuesday and the back to near or slightly
above normal Wednesday.

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE
SOUTHWEST...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND FAR
SOUTHEAST NORTH CAROLINA...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will move from central California into the
southern Great Basin through the day today. Moderate mid-level
southwesterly flow will round the base of this trough and overspread
much of the Southwest. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis is expected
in the southern Great Basin with a ~1000mb surface low forecast in
southern Utah by 00Z Thursday. Farther east, a strong mid-level jet
across the Missouri Valley this morning is forecast to strengthen as
it shifts eastward into the Tennessee Valley and Mid-Atlantic by
this evening. A surface low is expected to deepen across the
Appalachians and continue to deepen as it shifts northeastward into
Maine by early Thursday morning. A cold front will extend from this
surface low and exist the East Coast during the period.

...Southwest...
A deeply mixed boundary layer is expected across much of the
Southwest today as temperatures warm into the 70s. Very dry surface
conditions are anticipated with relative humidity in the 10 to 15
percent range. Deep mixing will help bring stronger mid-level flow
to the surface. This deep mixing combined with the tightening
pressure gradient will bring 25 to 30 mph sustained winds across
much of the Southwest. Critical fire weather conditions are expected
across most of Arizona and for the western half of New Mexico. Some
extremely critical meteorological conditions (with winds in excess
of 30 mph) are likely, but extremely critical fuels are not present
and thus an extremely critical area is not warranted.

...Northern Sacramento Valley...
A few hours of dry and breezy conditions are expected this afternoon
in the northern Central Valley. Down-valley mid-level flow will
provide upper level support for stronger winds than the surface
pressure gradient alone might suggest. Winds of 15 to 25 mph are
expected with relative humidity around 20 percent.

...Georgia into the Carolinas...
Dry-continental westerly flow is expected in the Carolinas today.
Forecast guidance suggests relative humidity drops into the 25 to 30
percent range across much of the region with winds in the 15 to 20
mph range. However, forecast guidance commonly overestimates
low-level moisture in these setups and sub 20 percent relative
humidity is certainly possible. ERCs above the 90th percentile
(above the 97th percentile in some locations) are common across much
of the Carolinas yielding fuels capable of large-fire spread. Fuels
are less favorable across Georgia, but meteorological conditions
would support elevated to low-end critical threat. Therefore, given
more marginal fuel dryness, and elevated is sufficient for this
region.

0228 AM CDT Wed Apr 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, an upper-level trough will shift slowly east across the
Rockies. This will lead to lee cyclogenesis in eastern Colorado and
critical fire weather conditions across a large portion of the
Southwest and Southern High Plains.

...Southeast Arizona into the southern High Plains...
Strong southwesterly flow aloft is expected to extend to the surface
across much of the Southwest as the boundary layer deepens through
deep vertical mixing. In addition, the surface pressure gradient
will tighten in response to the lee cyclogenesis in eastern
Colorado. This will combine for broad 25 mph winds across much of
southeast Arizona and New Mexico with relative humidity ranging from
8 to 15 percent.

...Northern Plains...
A tightening pressure gradient across the Plains will bring an
increase in surface winds likely to the 15 to 20 mph range across
the northern Plains. Cloud cover will limit surface heating and thus
keep relative humidity higher in the vicinity of a weak mid-level
shortwave trough moving through South Dakota. However, north of this
cloud shield, very dry surface conditions are expected with relative
humidity of 10 to 20 percent. These dry and windy conditions coupled
with ongoing drought conditions will lead to an elevated threat for
large fires on Thursday.

...Eastern Oregon into southwest Idaho and northern Nevada...
Dry and breezy northwesterly flow is expected in eastern Oregon as a
mid-level shortwave trough digs into the Pacific Northwest. These
winds will increase in response to a strengthening surface pressure
gradient and partly due to vertical mixing transporting stronger
mid-level flow to the surface. Fuels vary in this region with some
snowcover still present on higher peaks, but several smoke plumes in
this area in recent days show there are critical fuels in the area
and thus an elevated threat for large fires.

...A low pressure system will continue to bring wet snow across
northern New England through Thursday morning...

...Light snow lingers across central Rockies as the another surge
of cold air brings additional snowfall into the northern Rockies...

...Subfreezing record cold temperatures this morning across much
of the south-central U.S. will shift to parts of the eastern U.S.
Thursday morning...

...Fire weather threat increasing over the Desert Southwest as
well as over the Southeast U.S. coast today...

Much of the active weather today will be associated with an
intensifying low pressure system which is forecast to move across
the central Appalachians and into New England through tonight.  A
swath of wet snow is expected to expand northeastward near the
Canadian border from New York into northern New England through
Friday morning as the storm center passes just to the south.
Total snowfall amounts of 6 to 10 inches is forecast in these
areas with up to 12 inches possible over the northern tip of
Maine. Further south in the Mid-Atlantic to southern New England,
some showers and embedded thunderstorms are expected this
afternoon as a cold front moves quickly through the region.  In
fact, the Storm Prediction Center issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms for the Mid-Atlantic coast to southern New England
for today.

In the wake of the developing storm system, unseasonably cold air
will continue to surge into the central U.S. today and tomorrow,
leading to widespread Freeze Watches and Warnings that cover much
of the central U.S., Midwest and the interior eastern U.S.
Numerous daily record low temperatures are forecast to be tied or
broken this morning and Thursday morning as temperatures dip to
below freezing, around 20-25 degrees below average for late April.
 Residents in these areas are encouraged to take preventative
measures to mitigate the impacts of sub-freezing temperatures on
vulnerable vegetation if possible. By Friday, the cold airmass
will moderate as it drifts east, although low temperatures will
remain around 10 degrees below normal in the Central U.S., with
lows hovering in the mid-30's to 40's.

Meanwhile, active weather across Florida has been edging very
slowly southward into southern Florida ahead of a slow-moving
front. A low pressure wave forming on the front could bring
additional heavy showers and thunderstorms today across central
Florida. Improving conditions should begin Wednesday morning as
the wave moves off into the Atlantic and rain chances decrease
across southern Florida. While excessive rain may be problematic
in Florida, dry, windy conditions will set the stage for a fire
weather threat in Arizona over the next three days as low pressure
deepens in the region. Accordingly, the Storm Prediction Center
has issued an Elevated Risk of fire weather today, and a Critical
Risk tomorrow, with the potential for additional impactful fire
weather also highlighted on Friday.

another surge of cold air from western Canada reaches the northern
Rockies/High Plains on Thursday.  Temperatures will once again
tumble, along with a quick burst of snow, as the cold front passes
through much of Montana by Thursday evening.  The snow should move
further south into Wyoming by Friday morning.

Meanwhile, active weather across southern Florida is expected to
gradually move offshore as drier air arrives behind a front.  The
dry, windy conditions behind the front are forecast to increase
the threat of fire over the Carolinas today.  In addition, fire
weather threat will be increasing in Desert Southwest over the
next three days as low pressure deepens to the north.

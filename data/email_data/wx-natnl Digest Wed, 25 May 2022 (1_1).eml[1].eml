Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1043 AM CDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 241700Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE FOUR CORNERS INTO WEST
TEXAS...

Some modification was made to the dry thunderstorm area in New
Mexico. Adjustments were made based on where precipitation has
fallen in the last 24 hours. Furthermore, forcing for ascent appears
sufficient for scattered storm coverage in parts of
east-central/southeast New Mexico. This should tend to increase the
probability of wetting rainfall. Areas within the higher
terrain/foothills will have the greater likelihood of drier storms.
Some adjustments were also made to the Sacramento Valley to better
align with fuel and ensemble guidance. Elsewhere, the forecast
remains on track without change.

..Wendt.. 05/24/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0111 AM CDT Tue May 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected across a broad swath
of the Four Corners region into southern New Mexico and far west
Texas. An upper-level jet continues to nose into the southern
Plains, deepening a surface low over southeast NM/southwest TX and
enhancing mid-level flow over the greater Southwest region where
fuels remain critically dry. This feature will also support
thunderstorm chances across parts of the southern High Plains this
afternoon, which will pose a threat for isolated dry thunderstorms.

...Four Corners into Far West Texas...
Critical conditions remain likely as surface and boundary-layer
winds strengthen through the day. Despite modest overnight RH
recovery across parts of AZ and NM, drier conditions are noted
upstream in low-level water-vapor imagery and 00 UTC RAOBs. The
southeastward advection of this drier air mass coupled with diurnal
warming will result in widespread 5-15% RH values. Ensemble guidance
continues to show high probability for 20-25 mph sustained winds
from the Four Corners region into west TX. A few locations may see
periodic extremely critical conditions where RH values between 5-10%
are coincident with 30-40 mph wind gusts. While some spread in
deterministic solutions is noted, this potential may be maximized
across the Gila River region of southwest NM into far west TX.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Although some parts of northeast NM observed wetting rainfall over
the past 24 hours, most locations remain dry with receptive fuels.
00 UTC observed soundings from ABQ and DEN sampled PWAT values less
than 0.6 inches from the periphery of the moist plume over the
southern Plains. Despite this limited moisture, mid-level lapse
rates remain sufficiently steep (near 8 C/km) to support 100-500
J/kg MUCAPE this afternoon given adequate boundary-layer heating.
Thunderstorms are expected to develop by late afternoon within an
upslope-flow regime across northeast NM into southern CO. Fast storm
motions coupled the limited available moisture will support a dry
thunderstorm threat.

...Sacramento Valley...
Recent surface observations reveal an elongated surface trough
through central CA, resulting in northerly pressure-gradient winds
through the Sacramento Valley. Winds will increase again through the
afternoon, likely reaching top sustained speeds near 15 mph. Dry
conditions will persist and downslope warming/drying will foster
another day of 15-20% RH, resulting in elevated fire weather
conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1214 PM CDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

Overall, a lower-end Elevated fire weather day continues to be the
expectation across New Mexico. A weakening surface pressure gradient
through the day should keep the fire weather concerns much more
localized than previous days. Areas within and near the terrain have
the greatest chance at observing sustained Elevated conditions for a
few hours. No changes were made to the previous forecast.

..Wendt.. 05/24/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Tue May 24 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist into Wednesday afternoon for
portions of the Southwest, but will generally be more limited
compared to previous days. A northwesterly flow regime will maintain
dry and breezy conditions across the Four Corners into parts of far
west Texas. Critically dry fuels will undergo further curing on
Tuesday, and remain dry through the day Wednesday, supporting the
fire weather potential.

...New Mexico to far west Texas...
Winds over the Southwest will generally abate heading into Wednesday
as the upper-level trough and attendant surface low shift to the
east. However, 20 mph northwesterly winds will linger within the
850-700 mb layer. Boundary-layer deepening through the day should
easily mix these winds to the surface, yielding sustained 15-20 mph
winds with occasional gusts to 25-30 mph. Little moisture return
into the region will maintain dry conditions with widespread 5-15%
RH values likely. Consequently, areas of elevated fire weather
conditions are expected from northwest NM into far west TX. A few
locations may see 2-3 hours of Critical conditions, especially in
the lee of terrain features where topographically enhanced winds may
exceed 20 mph. However, this potential appears too limited at this
time for additional highlights.

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure is favored over the western (easter=
n)
half of the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) during week-2. This favors a more activ=
e
storm pattern throughout the period from the Great Plains to the Eastern
Seaboard. As a series of storms intensify and move eastward, they could bri=
ng
high winds to parts of the Southern Plains. Early in week-2, the potential
exists for a brief period of excessive heat in southern portions of
California=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs Central Valley. Conversely, a surfac=
e low pressure system
moving
eastward across the northern CONUS early in week-2 supports an increased
likelihood of much below-normal temperatures across eastern parts of the
Intermountain West, extending into the Central and Northern Plains. Floodin=
g
risks remain elevated across the Red River of the North, northern Minnesota=
,
and along the Tanana River in eastern Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for the San Joaquin Valley in California,
Wed-Thu, Jun 1-2.

Slight risk of much below-normal minimum temperatures across eastern parts =
of
the Intermountain West, extending into parts of the Central and Northern
Plains, Wed-Thu, Jun 1-2.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across the parts of the Central and
Southern High Plains, Wed-Tue, Jun 1-7.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible in parts of northern Minnesota.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana River Basin in eastern Mainland
Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY MAY 27 - TUESDAY MAY 31:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

DuOgrLfGNGl1zC-TKPgD2lI4TsViWY$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 01 - TUESDAY JUNE 07: Models are in good general agreeme=
nt
depicting a weak mean mid-level trough (ridge) pattern across the western
(eastern) CONUS during week-2. Early in week-2, a slight risk of excessive
heat
is posted for the San Joaquin Valley in California, Jun 1-2, where there is=
 at
least a 30% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, w=
ith
much of the area having at least a 20% chance of exceeding 95 deg F. Some
locations in the San Joaquin Valley also have the potential to exceed 100 d=
eg
F. The signal diminishes in intensity over the 2-day period, with the highe=
r
probabilities shifting southward.



Conversely, a slight risk of much below-normal temperatures is posted Jun 1=
-2
across eastern portions of the Intermountain West, extending into the Centr=
al
High Plains and the Northern Plains, associated with a storm system exiting
the
region early in week-2. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the historical
distribution and 40 deg F, with the potential for some high elevation areas=
 to
fall below freezing. Additionally, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model
solutions indicate deeper mid-level troughing across the west-central CONUS
during the first two days of week-2, relative to yesterday, and show better
spatial agreement. However, the troughing does appear to dissipate more
rapidly
in the GEFS, with the colder temperatures timing off by Jun 2, whereas the
ECMWF ensemble holds onto the cold signals through Jun 3. Despite the trend
toward a more amplified trough, the slight risk was not extended through Ju=
n 3
due to the uncertainty in the evolution of the pattern.



Along the leading edge of the mean (over the course of week-2) mid-level
trough
over the western CONUS, a series of surface low pressure systems are likely=
 to
eject out of the Rockies and move generally eastward with time, which could
bring increased chances for high winds to parts of the Central and Southern
Plains. Although the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools indicate mixe=
d
intensities in their respective signals, the long-wave pattern is favorable
for
windy conditions associated with storm systems that amplify over the Great
Plains. As such, a slight risk for episodes high winds is posted throughout
the
entirety of week-2, as the pattern is favored to remain active for the east=
ern
two-thirds of the CONUS. The slight risk area was expanded northward a bit,
compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook, due to a more am=
plified mean mid-level
trough
in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.



With ongoing river flooding along the Red River of the North, Northern
Minnesota, and the Tanana River Basin in eastern Mainland Alaska, and favor=
ed
near to above-normal precipitation during week-2 (along with near-record SW=
E
in
the Tanana Basin), flooding risks remain elevated along those basins.

Valid 12Z Fri May 27 2022 - 12Z Tue May 31 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper trough with possible embedded closed low will be crossing
the eastern U.S. late this week into the weekend, with some
uncertainty over how quickly it and the associated surface
wave/frontal system will ultimately clear the East Coast.
Meanwhile, a shortwave reaching the northwestern U.S. by Friday
will be at the leading edge of a larger scale mean trough that
should amplify over the West during the weekend and early next
week.  A strong ridge will build over an increasing portion of the
eastern half of the country as the western trough deepens.
Primary regions of focus for precipitation will be over the East
with the late week system, and then from the Northwest through the
northern-central Plains into western Great Lakes with a leading
frontal system and embedded waves that set up over the central
U.S. as the pattern amplifies while a trailing Pacific system also
enhances precipitation over parts of the West.  The southern High
Plains will likely see well above normal temperatures through the
period.  Farther north, the above normal anomalies will push
eastward and expand with time while below normal readings spread
across the Northwest and into the Great Basin/northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z model cycles, most guidance exhibited a
pronounced slower trend with the upper trough/low crossing the
East.  The CMC was the one faster holdout, though the 06Z GFS did
nudge a bit faster than the 00Z version.  New 12Z runs have really
lowered the confidence in any scenario though, as the
GFS/UKMET/ECMWF have trended faster by way of some combination of
faster progression of the initial trough and/or greater
interaction with a more amplified northern stream trough while the
CMC has jumped back to the 00Z ECMWF.  Meanwhile the models are
still in the process of trying to resolve the details of Pacific
dynamics that support a system tracking toward the Northwest
around Saturday.  The 06Z GFS was the deep extreme and the new 12Z
GFS has trended closer to other solutions.  On the other hand the
12Z ECMWF has become a weak/suppressed extreme.  Guidance agrees
fairly well that incoming Pacific energy will dig into the western
U.S., but with typical differences for the details.  Recent
ensemble mean trends imply at least a moderate degree of support
for latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs that show an embedded closed low for
a period of time.

Based on the array of 00Z/06Z guidance, the updated forecast
started with a blend of 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC early in
the period with the least weight on the CMC due to its faster
eastern upper trough.  Then the forecast transitioned to a blend
of 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and their ensemble means.  The new guidance
is suggesting a potential faster reversal for the initial eastern
system but better stability for the large scale pattern by early
next week.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Areas of heavy rainfall with the initial eastern system should be
tapering off by Friday, although a corridor of showers and storms
is still possible across the East Coast states ahead of a
weakening cold front.  There is the potential for some repeated
rounds of convection with heavy rain across portions of the
southern Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas but the potential for any flooding
appears marginal.  Pockets of heavy rainfall are also possible
across portions of the Northeast, although the system should be
more progressive there.  As rainfall diminishes in
coverage/intensity over the East, the dominant focus for
precipitation will extend from the Northwest through the
northern-central Plains into western Great Lakes.  Showers and
storms will initially develop across the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest in response to a developing low pressure/frontal system
over the north-central U.S. while some precipitation extends back
into the northern Rockies and vicinity.  A system expected to
reach the Northwest around Saturday could bring an episode of
enhanced precipitation to parts of the region, followed by this
moisture streaming across the Rockies and interacting with the
wavy frontal system set up over the Plains.  Colder trends over
the Northwest/northern Rockies should increase the potential for
some late season high elevation snow by around Sunday-Monday while
some areas of heavy rainfall could develop over northern tier
areas as well.  It will take additional time to resolve the
details within an amplified pattern that would tend to increase
the potential for a heavy precipitation event.

Temperatures will warm up considerably across the Plains by the
end of the week with highs reaching 10-20F above normal over some
areas, including 100-105F or so readings over western Texas where
some daily records could be challenged.  The southern High Plains
will remain on the hot side into early next week but with highs
declining at least a few degrees.  Meanwhile the heat will build
eastward to include the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and eventually the
East Coast through the weekend and into early next week,
compliments of the building upper ridge and southerly flow ahead
of the wavy mean front setting up over the Plains.  In contrast,
over the course of the period much cooler weather will spread
across the Northwest/northern Rockies and then into the Great
Basin and Northern Plains as upper troughing deepens over the
western U.S.  Within this area, highs of 10-20F below normal will
be most likely Sunday-Tuesday.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 24 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 30 - JUN 03, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the forecast mid-level
circulation pattern across the North American region. Ridges and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over Mainland Alaska and to the west =
of
the CONUS over the northeastern Pacific. A forecast trough over the western
CONUS is weaker in amplitude relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs 6-10 day period
forecasts,
while a greater amplitude ridge is forecast over the eastern CONUS in recen=
t
ensemble mean forecasts.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska, except for extre=
me
northern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, under positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored over the extreme
southern Alaska Panhandle southeastward to the northwestern CONUS, the Cent=
ral
and Northern Rockies, and the Northern Plains, under the forecast trough.
Above
normal temperatures are favored for parts of California, ahead of the ridge
over the northeastern Pacific. Above normal temperatures are also favored f=
or
the Southern Plains and the eastern CONUS, under a predicted ridge.

Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for the eastern Aleutians an=
d
the southwestern coast of Mainland Alaska, under a predicted ridge. Above
normal precipitation is slightly favored for eastern areas of interior
Mainland
Alaska and the North Slope, consistent with dynamical model precipitation
tools. Above normal precipitation is favored for the southern Alaska
Panhandle,
as a low pressure system is forecast to approach the coast during the perio=
d
in
most model solutions. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of
California and Nevada, ahead of a forecast ridge. Above normal precipitatio=
n
is
favored for the Pacific Northwest, the Northern and Central Rockies, the
Northern and Central Plains, and the western Great Lakes region, under and
ahead of the forecast trough. Southerly moisture flow into eastern areas of
the
Southwest enhances probabilities of above normal precipitation slightly for
this area.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools and increased model spread later in the period=
.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 01 - 07 2022

The predicted circulation pattern for the week-2 period is generally simila=
r
to
the forecast pattern for the 6-10 day period, but with a reduction in mid-
level
height anomalies in the ensemble means and the manual blend due to a
significant increase in uncertainty. Positive height anomalies are indicate=
d
over the Aleutians with slightly positive anomalies extending northeastward
over much of Mainland Alaska in the manual blend. Negative 500-hPa height
anomalies are forecast over the Alaska Panhandle in the ensemble means of t=
he
ECMWF, GEFS and Canadian models. Weak troughing and negative 500-hPa height
anomalies extend into the northwestern CONUS in the week-2 period. A weak
ridge
and positive 500-hPa height anomalies persist over much of the eastern CONU=
S
into week-2. Near average mid-level heights are forecast over the Gulf Coas=
t.

Above normal temperatures are slightly favored over much of the Aleutians a=
nd
Mainland Alaska under slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below nor=
mal
temperatures are favored for the southern Alaska Panhandle, under negative
500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored for the
northwestern and north-central CONUS under the predicted trough, early in t=
he
period. Above normal temperatures are favored for the Southern Plains, the
Lower Mississippi Valley, and much of the eastern CONUS, consistent with th=
e
temperature consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for interior Mainland Alaska=
,
consistent with the dynamical model forecasts, under southerly flow. Above
normal precipitation is favored for a small area of the southern Alaska
Panhandle, as a system is forecast to approach the coast early in the perio=
d.
Above normal precipitation is favored for most of the Pacific Northwest, un=
der
a predicted trough. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of
California and Nevada, ahead of the ridge. With the weakening trough over t=
he
West during the period, above normal precipitation is slightly favored for
parts of the Northern and Central Plains. Above normal precipitation is
favored
for eastern areas of the Southwest, as moisture is drawn northward into the
region.  Above normal precipitation is favored for the southeastern Atlanti=
c
coast, consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool and increased
moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic. Probabilities of be=
low
normal precipitation are increased for parts of the Midwest, under the
predicted ridge.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
predicted weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the forecast domain an=
d
weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools over most regions.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

...Heavy rain and thunderstorms with the risk for flooding will
move from the central to eastern U.S....

...Heat will expand over the West with some fire weather risk for
portions of the Southwest...

...Cooler weather remain over the Mid-Atlantic after
record-breaking heat as central portions of the country also see
below normal temperatures...

A low pressure system over the Southern Plains will move northward
through the Mississippi Valley during the short-term forecast
period. A large warm-sector will expand over the Mississippi
Valley and locations east as a warm front lifts north, with a slow
moving cold front traling the system helping to promote widespread
showers and thunderstorms. The greatest risk for flash flooding
will be on Wednesday with a Moderate Risk for Excessive Rainfall
in effect for northern portions of the Lower Mississippi
Valley/Mid-South. Thunderstorms along the cold front are forecast
to continuously build and move over areas that have recently seen
heavy rainfall. A broader Sligh Risk is in effect from southeast
Texas through the Lower Mississippi Valley where rainfall totals
between 2-3 inches, locally higher, are possible. A Slight Risk is
also in effect for portions of the Southern Appalachians Thursday
as storms along the front could again poduce up to 1-3 inches of
rainfall. Outside of the highlighted areas at greater risk for
flooding, widespread heavy rainfall is still exected from the Gulf
Coast northward through the Ohio Valley. Some severe weather is
also possible with broad Marginal Risks (level 1/5) from the Storm
Prediction Center in effect from the Mississippi Valley Wednesday
further east in the the Ohio Valley and Southeast Thursday. Some
hail and gusty winds are possible with any thunderstorm, as well
as a low tornado risk.

Meanwhile, in the West, hot temperatures will expand across the
region under the influence of an upper-level ridge.
Record-breaking heat is possible in central California Wednesday
where forecast high tempeartures in the low-100s are at or above
previous daily records. Much above normal tempeartures are
forecast for the Great Basin Thursday with highs in the mid-80s to
low 90s. Highs 5-10 degrees above normal can be expected outside
of these areas. Dry conditions are also expected, with the
combination of very low humidity and gusty winds over portions of
New Mexico and far west Texas leading to an Elevated Risk of Fire
Weather from the Storm Prediction Center. The pattern will change
for the Northwest late in the period Thursday evening as showers
expand over the area ahead of an approaching Pacific system.

After record-breaking heat over the weekend in the Mid-Atlantic, a
lingering low presure system off the North Carolina coast will
keep tempeartures cooler and scattered showers possible. High
temperatures in the low 60s Tuesday will moderate some by reaching
the low 70s by Thursday, but will remain around 10 degrees below
normal. The rest of the East Coast will be around normal with
tempeartures in the 60s and 70s for New England and the 80s for
the Southeast and Florida. Additionally, in the wake of the
eastward moving cold front over the central/eastern U.S., cooler,
below normal temperatures will spread eastward through the Plains
Wednesday and the Mississippi Valley Thursday. With the exception
of far south Texas, highs Wednesday will generally be in the low
60s to mid-70s for the Southern Plains and in the 50s from the
Central Plains northward to the Upper Midwest, about 10-20 degrees
below normal for this time of year. These cooler highs will move
eastward into the Mississippi Valley Thursday with temperatures
generally in the 60s and low 70s.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
426 PM EDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 12Z Fri May 27 2022 - 12Z Tue May 31 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper trough with possible embedded closed low will be crossing
the eastern U.S. late this week into the weekend, with some
uncertainty over how quickly it and the associated surface
wave/frontal system will ultimately clear the East Coast.
Meanwhile, a shortwave reaching the northwestern U.S. by Friday
will be at the leading edge of a larger scale mean trough that
should amplify over the West during the weekend and early next
week.  A strong ridge will build over an increasing portion of the
eastern half of the country as the western trough deepens.
Primary regions of focus for precipitation will be over the East
with the late week system, and then from the Northwest through the
northern-central Plains into western Great Lakes with a leading
frontal system and embedded waves that set up over the central
U.S. as the pattern amplifies while a trailing Pacific system also
enhances precipitation over parts of the West.  The southern High
Plains will likely see well above normal temperatures through the
period.  Farther north, the above normal anomalies will push
eastward and expand with time while below normal readings spread
across the Northwest and into the Great Basin/northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z model cycles, most guidance exhibited a
pronounced slower trend with the upper trough/low crossing the
East.  The CMC was the one faster holdout, though the 06Z GFS did
nudge a bit faster than the 00Z version.  New 12Z runs have really
lowered the confidence in any scenario though, as the
GFS/UKMET/ECMWF have trended faster by way of some combination of
faster progression of the initial trough and/or greater
interaction with a more amplified northern stream trough while the
CMC has jumped back to the 00Z ECMWF.  Meanwhile the models are
still in the process of trying to resolve the details of Pacific
dynamics that support a system tracking toward the Northwest
around Saturday.  The 06Z GFS was the deep extreme and the new 12Z
GFS has trended closer to other solutions.  On the other hand the
12Z ECMWF has become a weak/suppressed extreme.  Guidance agrees
fairly well that incoming Pacific energy will dig into the western
U.S., but with typical differences for the details.  Recent
ensemble mean trends imply at least a moderate degree of support
for latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs that show an embedded closed low for
a period of time.

Based on the array of 00Z/06Z guidance, the updated forecast
started with a blend of 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC early in
the period with the least weight on the CMC due to its faster
eastern upper trough.  Then the forecast transitioned to a blend
of 06Z GFS/00Z ECMWF and their ensemble means.  The new guidance
is suggesting a potential faster reversal for the initial eastern
system but better stability for the large scale pattern by early
next week.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Areas of heavy rainfall with the initial eastern system should be
tapering off by Friday, although a corridor of showers and storms
is still possible across the East Coast states ahead of a
weakening cold front.  There is the potential for some repeated
rounds of convection with heavy rain across portions of the
southern Mid-Atlantic/Carolinas but the potential for any flooding
appears marginal.  Pockets of heavy rainfall are also possible
across portions of the Northeast, although the system should be
more progressive there.  As rainfall diminishes in
coverage/intensity over the East, the dominant focus for
precipitation will extend from the Northwest through the
northern-central Plains into western Great Lakes.  Showers and
storms will initially develop across the Northern Plains and Upper
Midwest in response to a developing low pressure/frontal system
over the north-central U.S. while some precipitation extends back
into the northern Rockies and vicinity.  A system expected to
reach the Northwest around Saturday could bring an episode of
enhanced precipitation to parts of the region, followed by this
moisture streaming across the Rockies and interacting with the
wavy frontal system set up over the Plains.  Colder trends over
the Northwest/northern Rockies should increase the potential for
some late season high elevation snow by around Sunday-Monday while
some areas of heavy rainfall could develop over northern tier
areas as well.  It will take additional time to resolve the
details within an amplified pattern that would tend to increase
the potential for a heavy precipitation event.

Temperatures will warm up considerably across the Plains by the
end of the week with highs reaching 10-20F above normal over some
areas, including 100-105F or so readings over western Texas where
some daily records could be challenged.  The southern High Plains
will remain on the hot side into early next week but with highs
declining at least a few degrees.  Meanwhile the heat will build
eastward to include the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and eventually the
East Coast through the weekend and into early next week,
compliments of the building upper ridge and southerly flow ahead
of the wavy mean front setting up over the Plains.  In contrast,
over the course of the period much cooler weather will spread
across the Northwest/northern Rockies and then into the Great
Basin and Northern Plains as upper troughing deepens over the
western U.S.  Within this area, highs of 10-20F below normal will
be most likely Sunday-Tuesday.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
426 PM EDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 12Z Fri May 27 2022 - 12Z Tue May 31 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper trough with possible embedded closed low will be crossing
the eastern U.S. late this week into the weekend, with some
uncertainty over how quickly it and the associated surface
wave/frontal system will ultimately clear the East Coast.
Meanwhile, a shortwave reaching the northwestern U.S. by Friday
will be at the leading edge of a larger scale mean trough that
should amplify over the West during the weekend and early next
week.  A strong ridge will build over an increasing portion of the
eastern half of the country as the western trough deepens.
Primary regions of focus for precipitation will be over the East
with the late week system, and then from the Northwest through the
northern-central Plains into western Great Lakes with a leading
frontal system and embedded waves that set up over the central
U.S. as the pattern amplifies while a trailing Pacific system also
enhances precipitation over parts of the West.  The southern High
Plains will likely see well above normal temperatures through the
period.  Farther north, the above normal anomalies will push
eastward and expand with time while below normal readings spread
across the Northwest and into the Great Basin/northern Plains.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z model cycles, most guidance exhibited a
pronounced slower trend with the upper trough/low crossing the
East.  The CMC was the one faster holdout, though the 06Z GFS did
nudge a bit faster than the 00Z version.  New 12Z runs have really
lowered the confidence in any scenario though, as the
GFS/UKMET/ECMWF have trended faster by way of some combination of
faster progression of the initial trough and/or greater
interaction with a more amplified northern stream trough while the
CMC has jumped back to the 00Z ECMWF.  Meanwhile the models are
still in the process of trying to resolve the details of Pacific
dynamics that support a system tracking toward the Northwest
around Saturday.  The 06Z GFS was the deep extreme and the new 12Z
GFS has trended closer to other solutions.  On the other hand the
12Z ECMWF has become a weak/suppressed extreme.  Guidance agrees
fairly well that incoming Pacific energy will dig into the western
U.S., but with typical differences for the details.  Recent
ensemble mean trends imply at least a moderate degree of support
for latest GFS/ECMWF/CMC runs that show an embedded closed low for
a period of time.

the period with the least weight on the CMC due to its faster

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1256 AM CDT Wed May 25 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Northwesterly flow will persist across the Four Corners region into
the southern High Plains for today, maintaining at least regional
fire weather concerns. Early morning surface observations show very
dry conditions (nocturnal RH values in the single digits and teens)
across western NM into eastern AZ, and 00 UTC RAOBs also show
limited boundary-layer moisture. No appreciable moisture recovery is
expected, fostering another day of 5-15% RH values region wide.
Furthermore, active wildfires were noted yesterday across the
region, confirming the presence of critically dry fuels. Winds today
will generally be more benign compared to Tuesday as the surface low
over southern TX weakens. However, 20-30 mph flow within the
boundary layer will likely mix down amid strong diurnal heating by
mid afternoon. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph are expected, and
occasional gusts to 30-35 mph are possible (especially for locations
that typically see terrain-enhanced winds). Consequently, areas of
elevated (to briefly critical) fire weather conditions are expected.

...Flash flooding and severe weather threat for the Lower
Mississippi Valley and Mid-South...

...Record heat for portions of California; some fire weather risk
for portions of the Southwest...

...Mid-March weather for the Central Plains...

A storm system organizing over the Southern Plains early this
morning will continue to deepen through the day as it moves
northeastward toward the Corn Belt/Great Lakes. A warm front will
lift northward as well, allowing warm and moist Gulf air to surge
through the Lower Mississippi Valley. This will set the stage for
a heavy rain threat over much of the central Gulf Coast northward
into the Mid-South. Flash flooding will be possible, and a
Moderate Risk area (at least a 40% chance of flash flooding within
25 miles) is depicted in some areas along the Mississippi River.
Though some thunderstorms may be severe, the main hazard may be
the heavy rainfall. The storm will slowly move through the mid-MS
Valley and into the Ohio Valley on Thursday, spreading rainfall
farther northeastward into the Southeast and the Tennessee Valley.
Due to expected local heavy rain, flash flooding will again be
possible in some areas.

In the West, temperatures will again soar to near and over 100
degrees in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys which will
challenge daily records. Much above normal temperatures are likely
for the Great Basin as well, where readings well into the 80s and
low 90s will be common. On Thursday, the core of the hot
temperatures will shift northeastward into the the rest of the
Interior West and northern Rockies, where temperatures are
forecast to be 10-20 degrees above normal for late May. Over
portions of New Mexico and far southwest Texas, warm/hot and
dry/windy conditions may lead to a fire weather risk again for
today.

Over the Central Plains, on the northwest side of the storm
system, north to northeasterly flow combined with showers and
abundant cloudiness will keep temperatures quite chilly for late
May. In fact, high temperatures only in the 50s over much of the
region are more typical of mid-March. By Thursday, readings will
rebound into the 60s and low 70s as rain exits the area.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Wed May 25 2022

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase for parts of the Great Basin
Thursday afternoon. An approaching upper-level wave off the West
Coast will support pressure falls across the northern Great Basin
and Pacific Northwest. The low-level mass response will induce
south/southwesterly downslope flow off the Sierra Nevada into
northwestern and southern NV. Little moisture recovery into the
region is expected over the next 48 hours, and the combination of
downslope effects and deep boundary-layer mixing will exacerbate
low-level dryness. Forecast RH values in the 10-15% range appear
likely based on ensemble consensus, through some locations may see
RH values fall into the single digits. The modest nature of the
pressure falls will likely support 15-20 mph winds and several hours
of elevated fire weather conditions, though frequent gusts between
25-30 mph appear probable for southern NV where the strongest wind
signal is noted in ensemble guidance. Fuels across southern NV
remain critically dry based on latest ERC analyses and will support
the fire weather threat. Portions of northwest NV have seen only
5-10% of their normal rainfall over the past 30 days per AHPS
analyses, and reports from the local WFO indication that
lower-elevation grasses have cured. This fuel information, combined
with reasonably high confidence in elevated wind/RH conditions,
warrant an expansion of the risk area into northwest NV.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The approach of the upper-level wave will also provide sufficient
lift for scattered showers and thunderstorms across the greater
Pacific Northwest region. Forecast soundings from multiple models
hint that adequate mid-level moisture and steep mid-level lapse
rates may be in place across northern NV to support a few isolated
thunderstorms. PWAT values near 0.5 inches and a deep/dry sub-cloud
layer will support the potential for dry lightning. At this time the
greatest potential for thunderstorms only marginally overlaps
spatially with critically dry fuels, but this potential will be
monitored for northwest to central NV where fuels are receptive.

...Weather Pattern Overview...

An upper trough with possible embedded closed low will be crossing
the eastern U.S. late this week into the weekend, with some
uncertainty over how quickly it and the associated surface
wave/frontal system exits the East Coast.  Meanwhile, a shortwave
reaching the northwestern U.S. by Friday will be at the leading
edge of a larger scale trough that should amplify over the West
during the weekend and into early next week.  A strong ridge will
build over an increasing portion of the eastern half of the
country going into the beginning of June as the western trough
deepens, with the potential for a blocky pattern to develop.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance suite is now favoring a more amplified
trough solution across the East Coast region for Saturday, with
both the GFS and CMC favoring a bit of a closed low.  Out West,
the guidance shows good timing agreement on the initial shortwave
into the West late this week, and the CMC is slightly slower with
the second impulse, which will reinforce the overall synoptic
scale trough that develops across the western U.S. by Sunday and
beyond.  Going into Tuesday, the GFS gets stronger and faster with
the trough over the Rockies and lifting it out across the western
High Plains.  There is very good model agreement on the building
upper ridge over the Ohio Valley.  The WPC forecast trended more
towards the ensemble means for the second half of the period to
account for this uncertainty, whilst still maintaining some of the
deterministic CMC/ECMWF/GFS, and generally shows good continuity
with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

With rainfall diminishing in coverage/intensity over the East by
the weekend, the main focus for precipitation will extend from the
Northwest through the northern-central Plains into the western
Great Lakes.  Showers and storms will initially develop across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest in response to a developing low
pressure and frontal boundary over the north-central U.S., while
some precipitation extends back into the northern Rockies and
vicinity.  Another shortwave reaching the Pacific Northwest around
Saturday could bring an episode of enhanced precipitation to parts
of the region, followed by this moisture streaming across the
Rockies and interacting with the wavy frontal system set up over
the Plains.  Late season snow for the higher terrain of the
Northern Rockies is looking increasingly likely, with potentially
over a foot of accumulation above 8000 feet elevation.  There is
also the potential for heavy rainfall across portions of the
Dakotas by early next week behind the front with moist upslope
flow, with perhaps 1 to 3 inches for some areas.

Temperatures will be quite warm across the central and southern
Plains for the weekend with highs reaching well into the 90s from
southern Nebraska to the Gulf Coast, and some low-mid 100s across
western Texas which could challenge some daily records.  The heat
then builds eastward to include the Ohio Valley and eventually the
East Coast going into early next week, compliments of the building
upper ridge and southerly flow ahead of the storm system over the
Plains.  Well below normal temperatures will likely encompass
areas from the Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies and
Northern Plains as the upper trough moves in behind the cold
front, with highs up to 20 degrees below late May averages.

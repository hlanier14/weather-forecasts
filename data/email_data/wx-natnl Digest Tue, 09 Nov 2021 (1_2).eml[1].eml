...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview...
Upper ridging to the southwest of California as well as over the
Canadian archipelago favors amplified troughing over the central
to eastern CONUS later this week into the weekend. This favors a
deepening central states cyclone that will lift northeastward
through the Midwest/Great Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air
over much of the Lower 48 will trend cooler with time as the
attendant cold front sweeps eastward, favoring a widespread swath
of modest to locally heavy rain across much of the East.  Within
the western half of the low pressure area, wrap-around and then
lake effect snow is likely over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes late week and then the central/northern Appalachians.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution and forecast clustering has improved slightly
Thu into Fri. A composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
seems reasonable, is in line with the NBM and GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means and maintains good WPC continuity in this time
frame. However, the 00z Canadian and UKMET guidance become flatter
and appear to retrograde the Western ridge into the Pacific, which
by the end of the period leaves them verging on being completely
out of phase with the other guidance. Given uncertainty in recent
trends, the WPC product suite was derived from a composite blend
of compatible guidance from GFS/ECMWF/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensembles/National Blend of Models (with the NBM removed from QPF
consideration late in the period).


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
Amplifying upper pattern will support surface cyclogenesis over
the Upper Midwest into Thu as Gulf moisture streams northward
along and ahead of the cold front, enhancing rainfall from the
southern Appalachians northward into the Northeast.  As the system
moves into Canada, backside cold air flow by next Friday will
likely support some snow within the system's comma head over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and subsequently with cold flow
off the lakes and into the northern/central Appalachians. This
could be the first accumulating snow of the season for some areas
of northern Minnesota into the eastern Dakotas. Temperatures will
be near to above normal early in the week, with possible record
highs ahead of the front on Friday in the Mid-Atlantic, but
trending cooler by week's end especially into the Southeast
(relative to typical mid-November values there).

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing several
rounds of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest,
especially later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy
rains and elevation snows over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough positioned over the northern Great Plains will
shift east into the Great Lakes region throughout the day.
Meanwhile, another mid-level short-wave trough will move across the
Great Basin region into central/northern High Plains. Mid-level flow
within these features is expected to remain marginally enhanced. At
the surface, a cold front will move into portions of the southern
High Plains and stall out, with perhaps concurrent weak lee
cyclogenesis occurring. Warm/dry conditions will prevail south of
the front, across portions of northeast New Mexico and the Texas
Panhandle. However, southeasterly surface winds are expected to
remain well below critical thresholds during the afternoon in most
areas. Thus, some potential for localized elevated fire-weather
conditions is possible, particularly in terrain-favored regions with
overlapping fuel receptivity.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CST Mon Nov 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level trough is forecast to enter the West Coast
and move across the Rockies into the central/southern High Plains by
the end of the forecast period. Strong northwesterly flow associated
with a mid-level jet streak will then enter the Pacific Northwest
and extend into portions of the Southwest. At the surface, lee
cyclogenesis should occur once again across the southern High Plains
during the afternoon. However, winds are expected to remain light in
most areas. Perhaps a few pockets of terrain-enhanced wind/RH combos
will emerge to support some potential for elevated fire-weather
conditions. However, such conditions are expected to be highly
localized, and thus, no highlights have been introduced.

...Moderate to heavy rain and high elevation snow expected to move
into northern California by tonight...

...More stormy conditions expected to impact the Pacific Northwest
with another  round of rain/snow spreading through the northern
Rockies/Great Basin on Tuesday...

...Threat of strong to severe thunderstorms increasing over the
central/southern Plains later on Wednesday...

Very active and unsettled weather will continue to impact the
Pacific Northwest and northern California as more energetic storm
systems from the Pacific are forecast to move onshore.  A rapidly
deepening cyclone located to the west of British Columbia, Canada
will help guide a weaker low pressure system toward northern
California.  The moisture rich environment ahead of this system
will bring a wave of moderate to heavy rain and high elevation
snow into northern California by tonight.  Meanwhile, a strong
cold front associated with the rapidly deepening low will reach
the Pacific Northwest coast early on Tuesday.  Moderate to heavy
rain, mountain snow, rough seas and increasingly strong and gusty
winds ahead of the front will overspread much of the Pacific
Northwest tonight into Tuesday.  The rain/mountain snow will
penetrate further inland across the Great Basin/Intermountain West
and then quickly into the northern Rockies during the day on
Tuesday.  The rain/mountain snow is expected to linger into
Wednesday even with the departure of the strong front as an
elongated low pressure system is forecast to form up and down the
High Plains on Wednesday.

The aforementioned elongated low pressure system is forecast to
destabilize the atmosphere across the Plains on Wednesday, with an
increasing threat of strong to severe thunderstorms later that day
over the central/southern Plains where a low pressure wave is
forecast to develop.  A swath of enhanced rainfall can also be
expected to move through the northern Plains on Wednesday ahead of
the elongated low pressure system.

Much of the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience
above normal temperatures during the next couple of days, and
especially ahead of the elongated low pressure system.  Below
normal temperatures are expected in the western U.S.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon November 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 14 - 18 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble model solutions are in good agre=
ement with the predicted
500-hPa height pattern across Alaska during the next 6 to 10 days. Over the
contiguous U.S. (CONUS), there are large inconsistencies between the GEFS a=
nd
the ECMWF ensemble over the strength and location of mean mid-level height
features. The Canadian mid-level ensemble solution is in good agreement wit=
h
the ECMWF ensemble over most of the forecast domain. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual 500-hPa
height blend favors positive height anomalies over Alaska. Downstream, mean
mid-level ridge and above-normal 500-hPa heights are depicted over the west=
ern
half of the CONUS. From the Mississippi Valley eastward, a mean trough and
below-normal mid-level heights are favored.

Mean surface high pressure in northern Alaska favors predominantly easterly
flow and below-normal temperatures for the southern half of the Mainland,
eastern Aleutians, and the Panhandle. A mean ridge over the western CONUS
enhances odds of above-normal temperatures, with the greatest probabilities
(>70% chance) in the southwestern CONUS. Conversely, a mean mid-level troug=
h
over the eastern CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of below-normal
temperatures from the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley eastward.

Surface high pressure enhances odds of below-normal precipitation across mu=
ch
of Alaska. Downstream, the ridge over the western CONUS is slightly
deamplified, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day for=
ecast, favoring greater
onshore Pacific flow and a more active storm track across the Northern Tier=
 of
the CONUS from the Pacific Northwest eastward to the Upper Midwest. Under
greater influence of the mean ridge over the western CONUS, below-normal
precipitation is favored from California to the Southern and Central Plains=
.
Behind the mean trough axis, below-normal precipitation probabilities are
enhanced across much of the Southeast, with below-normal precipitation
probabilities extending northward and diminishing toward the Ohio Valley,
Mid-Atlantic, and parts of the Northeast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to po=
or
agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble m=
odel solutions in the
predicted mid-level height pattern over the CONUS. However, model temperatu=
re
and precipitation fields are in overall good agreement.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 16 - 22 2021

Large disagreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model guidance in th=
e
predicted mean 500-hPa height pattern over much of the forecast domain duri=
ng
Week-2. The GEFS shows weak mid-level height anomalies over most of the CON=
US.
However, the Canadian and ECMWF ensemble guidance agree better with respect=
 to
the major mid-level features. All models are in good agreement with respect=
 to
the predicted mean mid-level height pattern over Alaska, with positive 500-=
hPa
heights anomalies favored over the entire state. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDs mean mid-level
height
pattern indicates some slight retrogression and deamplification, relative t=
o
yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs Week-2 forecast. Above-normal 500-hPa=
 heights are favored over
the
West Coast of the CONUS. Near- to below-normal mid-level heights are most
likely elsewhere over the CONUS.

Surface high pressure over northwestern Canada, extending slightly into
northern Mainland Alaska, favors increased easterly flow and below-normal
temperature probabilities across southern Alaska. Due to the retrogression =
and
deamplification of the mean mid-level height pattern across the CONUS,
below-normal temperatures probabilities are weakly favored across the North=
ern
Tier from Washington eastward to the Northern Plains. Underneath predominan=
tly
above-normal and near-normal mid-level heights over the West Coast and the
southwestern CONUS, respectively, enhanced above-normal temperature
probabilities are favored and extend eastward to the Lower Mississippi Vall=
ey.
Along a mean trough axis over the eastern CONUS, below-normal temperatures =
are
favored over the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic.

Mean surface high pressure over northwestern Canada increases chances of
below-normal precipitation across much of Alaska. The deamplification of th=
e
mean ridge over the western CONUS, relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs Week-2 forecast,
increases odds for above-normal precipitation across the Northern Tier from
the
Pacific Northwest to the Great Lakes, due to increased Pacific flow.
Probabilities of above-normal precipitation are also favored across the
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys, associated with a potential surface low press=
ure
system developing over the Great Plains and moving eastward during the midd=
le
of the period. Near- to above-normal 500-hPa heights across the southwester=
n
CONUS increases odds of below-normal precipitation. In the southeast CONUS,
odds tilt toward below-normal precipitation from the Big Bend of Florida
northward along the Atlantic Coast to southeastern Virginia, due to mean
surface high pressure dominating through much of the period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to la=
rge
inconsistencies among the models in the predicted mean 500-hPa height patte=
rn
over the CONUS, in addition to a potential pattern change across the CONUS,
increasing uncertainty. However, there is decent agreement in the model
temperature and precipitation fields.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
November 18.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview...
Upper ridging to the southwest of California as well as over the
Canadian archipelago favors amplified troughing over the central
to eastern CONUS later this week into the weekend. This favors a
deepening central states cyclone that will lift northeastward
through the Midwest/Great Lakes into Canada Thu-Sat. Milder air
over much of the Lower 48 will trend cooler with time as the
attendant cold front sweeps eastward, favoring a widespread swath
of modest to locally heavy rain across much of the East.  Within
the western half of the low pressure area, wrap-around and then
lake effect snow is likely over the Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes late week and then the central/northern Appalachians.

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing a long fetch
plume of Pacific moisture into the Pacific Northwest, especially
later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...
Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution and forecast clustering has improved slightly
Thu into Fri. A composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
seems reasonable, is in line with the NBM and GEFS/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means and maintains good WPC continuity in this time
frame. However, the 00z Canadian and UKMET guidance become flatter
and appear to retrograde the Western ridge into the Pacific, which
by the end of the period leaves them verging on being completely
out of phase with the other guidance. Given uncertainty in recent
trends, the WPC product suite was derived from a composite blend
of compatible guidance from GFS/ECMWF/NAEFS/ECMWF
ensembles/National Blend of Models (with the NBM removed from QPF
consideration late in the period).


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...
Amplifying upper pattern will support surface cyclogenesis over
the Upper Midwest into Thu as Gulf moisture streams northward
along and ahead of the cold front, enhancing rainfall from the
southern Appalachians northward into the Northeast.  As the system
moves into Canada, backside cold air flow by next Friday will
likely support some snow within the system's comma head over the
Dakotas/Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and subsequently with cold flow
off the lakes and into the northern/central Appalachians. This
could be the first accumulating snow of the season for some areas
of northern Minnesota into the eastern Dakotas. Temperatures will
be near to above normal early in the week, with possible record
highs ahead of the front on Friday in the Mid-Atlantic, but
trending cooler by week's end especially into the Southeast
(relative to typical mid-November values there).

Upstream, there is a growing guidance signal bringing several
rounds of rain and mountain snow to the Pacific Northwest,
especially later this week. Favorable flow should focus heavy
rains and elevation snows over the Olympics and Washington
Cascades.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: The mid-level pattern is anticipated to be fairly progressive dur=
ing
week-2, with a series of mid-level lows traversing the lower 48. This patte=
rn
is expected to limit the chances for prolonged hazardous weather over the
forecast domain. The only hazard posted is for increased chances for much
below
normal temperatures across parts of the eastern contiguous U.S. lingering f=
rom
the end of week-1 into the beginning of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Ohio Vall=
ey,
Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic, Tue-Wed, Nov 1=
6-
17.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY NOVEMBER 11 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vo47yg4lnmKO40H46OjrO7zaUa2wbeDGQlvonZF_S5PssE5pcHMHAS5LuRzqq=
Luq5H5YL_F_$

FOR TUESDAY NOVEMBER 16 - MONDAY NOVEMBER 22: Multiple models indicate a
progressive mid-level pattern for week-2, with a series of mid-level shortw=
ave
troughs propagating throughout the CONUS during the period. This pattern
typically is less favorable for widespread hazards. Mid-level low pressure =
is
anticipated to move eastward across the eastern third of the CONUS from the
end
of week-1 into the beginning of week-2, potentially supporting lingering
anomalously cold temperatures across parts of the East. A slight risk of mu=
ch
below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the Ohio Valley, Tennessee
Valley, Appalachians, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic, Nov 16 to 17, where the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and freezing. The deterministic 6Z GF=
S
indicates the potential of some areas experiencing anomalies of negative 10
degrees or greater, although the daily ensemble mean anomalies are not as
significant.



Mid-level shortwave troughing across the Great Basin and Four Corners regio=
n
at
the beginning of the period may support surface low formation across the
central CONUS and associated frontal activity. This disturbance in addition=
 to
enhanced moist flow from the Gulf of Mexico associated with surface high
pressure across the southeastern CONUS may support enhanced precipitation
across parts of the eastern CONUS from the beginning to middle of week-2. T=
he
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulated
precipitation totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch across part=
s
of
the Lower Mississippi Valley and Tennessee Valley during the 10-12 day peri=
od
(Nov 18 to 20). Due to the daily ensemble means from the GEFS and ECMWF hav=
ing
significant differences regarding the evolution of this feature and areas w=
ith
the greatest chances of heavy precipitation, a related heavy precipitation
risk
is not posted at this time.



The GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means indicate the possibility of a surface low
forming over the Northern Plains at the beginning of the period, which coul=
d
support upslope snow across parts of the Northern Rockies at the beginning =
of
the period. Due to the reforecast tools limiting the 3-day liquid equivalen=
t
totals to less than one inch, a related heavy snow hazard is not designated=
 at
this time.



Mid-level ridging across western Mainland Alaska at the end of week-1 is
anticipated to gradually retrograde throughout week-2, as mid-level troughi=
ng
(ridging) forms across the Mainland (Alaska Panhandle). The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF,
and
Canadian model ensemble means indicates surface high pressure building acro=
ss
many parts of Mainland Alaska excluding the southern coastal areas at the
beginning of the period, which could support anomalously cold temperatures
across the southern half of the state. The GEFS reforecast tool indicates o=
nly
a brief possibility of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile on day 8 (Nov 16), across the southwestern and southeastern
portions
of the Mainland. Daily ensemble means do not support widespread areas of
anomalies reaching negative 10 Deg F. Therefore, a related risk of much bel=
ow
normal temperatures is not posted at this time. Near to below normal
precipitation is generally favored throughout the week-2 period.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1223 AM CST Tue Nov 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to move across the western CONUS today
into tonight, while an upper ridge will begin to build across the
eastern Pacific in the wake of the trough. At the surface, a weak
trough is forecast to develop across the central/northern High
Plains, while weak offshore flow may begin to impact portions of
southern California by early Wednesday morning. Relatively dry
conditions are expected across portions of the southern Rockies/High
Plains, but winds are expected to generally remain light where
receptive fuels are present, and the fire-weather threat should
remain low through the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1225 AM CST Tue Nov 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough is forecast to amplify as it moves across the
central CONUS on Wednesday. An attendant surface low will deepen
over the central/southern High Plains during the day, before moving
into portions of the upper Midwest by early Thursday morning.
Meanwhile, in the wake of the trough, an upper ridge is forecast to
build into portions of the western CONUS. A surface ridge will
become established over the Great Basin, resulting in offshore flow
across portions of southern California.

...Southern/central High Plains...
Dry and breezy post-frontal conditions are expected across parts of
the southern and central High Plains on Wednesday. The greatest
relative fire-weather risk is currently expected over portions of
southeast NM into west TX, where sustained winds of 15-25 mph (with
higher gusts) and minimum RH values below 20% are forecast,
resulting in elevated to locally critical conditions. Some guidance
suggests the potential for elevated conditions further north into
parts of eastern CO and the TX/OK Panhandles, though uncertainty is
greater regarding the extent and duration of RH reductions in this
region, due to cooler post-frontal temperatures.

...Southern California...
Elevated wind/RH conditions may develop late Wednesday night/early
Thursday morning across terrain-favored portions of Santa Barbara
and Ventura Counties, as offshore flow becomes established across
the region. However, with potentially limited coverage/duration of
elevated conditions and a lack of more initially receptive fuels, no
highlights have been included.

...Robust Midwest/Great Lakes Low into later this week...

...Multiple rounds of precipitation into the Pacific Northwest
later this week...


...Pattern Overview and Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Anticipated flow transition will lead to development and passage
of an amplified upper trough over the central to eastern U.S.
Friday/Saturday as a potent surface low lifts northeastward
through the Midwest/Great Lakes into eastern Canada. An attendant
cold front will sweep eastward across the East, favoring a swath
of moderate to locally heavy rain as fueled by long fetch moisture
influx from the Gulf of Mexico and the western Atlantic. The
progressive nature of the front may limit runoff threat, but the
best potential may be over favored terrain of interior New
England. Enhanced wrap-around then lake effect snows are expected
from the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and into the northern
Appalachians/Northeast.
Cold air and return moisture flow with another potent upper
shortwave/surface system digging into the Midwest/Great Lakes
onward on the heels of the lead storm will favor local snows
across the region.

Meanwhile upstream, another long fetch plume of Pacific moisture
will feed into the Pacific Northwest, Friday into Saturday before
easing. Subsequent rounding flow with embedded shortwaves may also
support additional periods of enhanced precipitation later this
period. Overall, favorable flow should focus heavy rains and
elevation snows over the Olympics and Cascades.


...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to illustrate a reasonably similar larger scale
pattern evolution and forecast clustering has improved slightly
through this forecast period. Accordingly, the WPC medium range
product suite was primarily derived from a composite blend of best
clustered guidance from the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble
means along with the National Blend of Models days 3-7
(Friday-next Tuesday). This strategy acts to maintain decent
system depths and detail consistent with a pattern with near
average predictability. WPC product continuity is also well
maintained.

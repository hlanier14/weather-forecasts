Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0950 AM CST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fire weather concerns remain low for today. A cold front continues
to push south/southeast towards the Gulf Coast and lower Mississippi
River Valley with bands of snow ongoing across portions of northwest
TX and west OK where drought conditions are most pronounced. Areas
of the southern Plains that have not received precipitation over the
past 24 hours are experiencing well below seasonal temperatures,
which will further mitigate fire weather potential. A -4 mb DAG-LAX
pressure gradient is driving wind gusts between 35-50 mph within the
higher terrain along the southern CA coast. A few locations are
experiencing elevated to critical wind/RH conditions, but regional
ERCs remain too low to support a substantial fire weather risk.
Winds are expected to gradually abate through the day and into the
evening hours.

..Moore.. 03/11/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1240 AM CST Fri Mar 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper-level trough will continue to shift east and intensify
today. At the surface, a strong cold front will push south and east
through the Plains and into the lower Mississippi Valley. High
pressure will remain in the Great Basin and build into a large
portion of the country east of the Divide.

Fire weather concerns will be relatively low during the period.
Strong offshore winds are still expected through mid morning in
southern California. Live fuel moisture remains high enough to limit
fire weather concerns. Pockets of dry and windy conditions are also
possible behind the cold front in the Plains and the Southwest.
Between limited spatial coverage and poorly receptive fuels,
concerns will similarly be mitigated in these areas as well.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
139 PM EST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 14 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 18 2022

...Overview...
Two systems in progressive flow are noted over the Lower 48 next
week. The first system shifts east from the southern Plains and
through Southeast Monday night through Wednesday before turning
northeast, pushing off the southern Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday.
Meanwhile, an ongoing atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest
shifts down to the northern California coast Monday night ahead of
the next wave that crosses the Pacific Northwest coast Tuesday.
Much above normal temperatures will shift east over the central
and eastern U.S. between these two waves mid to late week,
offering spring-like temperatures reaching 10-20 above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Excellent agreement among the latest deterministic guidance is
noted in the in the main surface and 500mb features and evolution
through Wednesday. North-south waffling between guidance on the
progression/amplitude of the closed mid-level low over the
Southeast Tues-Wed have diminished, particularly with the 12Z GFS
that is a bit deeper and slower with the mid-level low compared to
the 06Z GFS which is in excellent agreement with the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC. The 00Z CMC is still slower starting Wednesday night
with the low tracking over the Carolina Coast, so a fairly evenly
distributed blend among the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS into
Day 5 favors the 00Z CMC less with the addition of ensemble means
for Days 6/7 to replace the UKMET (which we only get 5 days worth
of data). Furthermore, the GFS is more amplified with the next
wave out West Wednesday night/Thursday while the ECMWF is less
amplified, so they are now in better agreement with each other.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
Low pressure over the southern Great Plains Monday night shifts to
the Gulf coast shifts across the lower MS Valley into Tuesday and
over the Gulf Coast/Southeast mid-week. This system should draw up
ample Gulf moisture ahead of it and could combine with sufficient
instability to bring widespread thunderstorms capable of producing
heavy rainfall, especially along/near the Gulf Coast region. With
a bit of a slower solution to the low, there is now a marginal
threat for excessive rain over north Florida Tuesday/Tuesday night
which is an area currently receiving heavy rain and already had
above normal rainfall over the past week going into today. The
atmospheric river is fairly progressive Monday night into Tuesday
as it pushes across northern California, bringing beneficial
rainfall and heavy elevation snowfall.
A taste of spring-like temperatures is generally expected for much
of the central to eastern U.S. next week under the ridge between
the two systems. Daytime highs reach 10 to 20 degrees above normal
on Tuesday over the Northern Plains, slowly shifting across the
Great Lakes to the Northeast through Friday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1255 PM CST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Fire weather potential remains low with no changes needed.
Confidence in 15-20 mph winds has increased for parts of northwest
TX Saturday afternoon, which may support a few hours of elevated
fire weather conditions if RH can fall into the low 20s/upper teens.
Elevated conditions appear most probable within the Snyder to
Vernon, TX corridor where ensemble probabilities for sub-20% RH are
highest. However, a dry bias is noted in recent hi-res guidance
(likely due to poor assimilation of recent snowfall and
boundary-layer moistening), which casts uncertainty into the RH
forecast. Additionally, the ongoing snow/cold temperatures has
likely mitigated fuel status to a degree, and fuel response will be
dependent on the magnitude and duration of warm/dry conditions
tomorrow.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1242 AM CST Fri Mar 11 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will move off of the East Coast on
Saturday. In the West, an upper-level ridge will continue to
progress towards the Plains. A shortwave trough dropping
southeastward out of the Canadian Prairie Provinces will promote a
northern Plains/upper Midwest surface low. Some surface troughing
may extend into the southern High Plains.

Flow in the southern Plains will turn to southerly/southwesterly as
the surface high shifts to the east. With the subtle lee troughing
that is expected, some dry and modestly breezy conditions are
possible. Given possible precipitation along with colder
temperatures on Friday, fine fuels will likely need further drying
before fire weather concerns will increase again.

...A significant winter storm will impact portions of the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys northeastward into the Mid-Atlantic and
New England tonight through early Sunday...

...Temperatures will fall 20 to 30 degrees below average across
the central and eastern U.S. behind an Arctic cold front,

morning...

...Heavy rain and possible flash flooding for northern Florida
into southeastern Georgia will continue through this evening
before waning early Saturday morning...

...Locally heavy rain and mountain snow to affect the Pacific
Northwest beginning late Saturday...

An active weather pattern will affect the eastern third of the
nation through Saturday as a strong upper level trough moves east
from the central U.S. An area of low pressure at the surface will
organize tonight over the Gulf Coast states out ahead of the upper
level trough, rapidly deepening during the day on Saturday as the
low quickly tracks northeastward toward the coast of New England.
Anomalously cold air will filter in behind a series of cold fronts
that will consolidate into a single system late Saturday over the
eastern U.S.

Snow will begin to overspread locations from the Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys tonight, with 1 to 3 inches of accumulation expected
as far south as northern Mississippi into northern Alabama. Higher
totals are forecast just north into central Tennessee and the
Upper Ohio Valley before heavy snow transitions to snow showers
for late Saturday afternoon. Farther east, rain will change to
snow for the Mid-Atlantic states into southern New England early
Saturday as winds turn to northwesterly and increase in speed.
Snowfall rates of 1 to 2 inches per hour are expected to combine
with winds gusting up to 50 mph which will make for extremely
dangerous travel given significant reductions to visibility on
Saturday. The highest snowfall accumulations are expected over
central and northern New York into northern New England where 6 to
over 12 inches are likely. The storm system will continue to
rapidly deepen as it exits into the Canadian Maritimes Saturday
night leaving a dome of cold high pressure in its wake over the
East Coast for Sunday.

Heavy rain, which is ongoing Friday evening across northern
Florida, will continue though tonight, before coming to an end as
the cold front pushes through the area Saturday morning. Much
colder air will be found in the wake of the cold front, as much as
20 to 30 degrees below average for this time of year, from the
central to the eastern U.S. Sub-freezing temperatures are forecast
as far south as the central Gulf Coast to northern Florida with
several record low temperatures expected Sunday morning,
stretching from Louisiana to Florida, the Tennessee Valley into
the Mid-Atlantic region.

Across the western half of the nation, fairly quiet weather will
begin to become more active with the approach of a Pacific cyclone
into Washington and Oregon late Saturday. Periods of heavy rain
along with heavy mountain snow will accompany this storm system
which will spread east into the interior Northwest by Sunday
morning. After a brief break, another round of
precipitation will begin to approach the Pacific Northwest Sunday
night as another cold front nears the coast.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri March 11 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 17 - 21 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. A strong ridge is expected over th=
e
Bering Sea and deep downstream troughing and associated below normal 500-hP=
a
heights are forecast across the Gulf of Alaska, extending north to Mainland
Alaska. Consistent with the positive phases of the AO and the NAO, broad
troughing is forecast across the Davis Strait and southern Greenland while
anomalous ridging is forecast to the south across most of the western
mid-latitude North Atlantic. Above normal heights associated with the ridgi=
ng
over the Atlantic are forecast to overspread most of the eastern CONUS. Low
amplitude flow is predicted across most of the remainder of the CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are likely for Alaska, associated with predicted
deep
troughing. Below normal temperatures are also likely for the Northern and
Central Rockies in association with the below normal 500-hPa heights.  Broa=
d,
low amplitude flow and above normal heights lead to increased odds of above
normal temperatures for the southwestern CONUS. As above normal heights are
predicted to overspread the eastern CONUS associated with ridging in the
western Atlantic, above normal temperatures are likely from the Eastern
Seaboard westward to the Plains.

Below normal precipitation is likely for most of western and central Mainla=
nd
Alaska, and the Aleutians, downstream of a ridge predicted over the Bering
Sea,
while above normal precipitation is favored for the Alaska Panhandle and pa=
rts
of southeastern Mainland Alaska due to the troughing. With enhanced Pacific
Flow expected, increased odds of above normal precipitation are indicated f=
or
the northwestern CONUS. Below normal precipitation is most likely for much =
of
the southwestern CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains, well to the south =
of
the predicted mean storm track. Above normal precipitation is favored for m=
ost
of the eastern CONUS, the Central Plains, and Mississippi Valley, due to th=
e
potential for return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surfa=
ce
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Below normal precipitation is
favored
for parts of the Northern Plains consistent with the consolidation tool
forecast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's operatio=
nal
12z ECMWF centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement on a positive AO/NAO pattern early in the period.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 19 - 25 2022

During week-2, the positive NAO/AO signal is forecast to significantly weak=
en,
as 500-hPa heights return to near normal across much of the higher latitude=
s
of
the Northern Hemisphere. However, ridging is forecast to persist across the
western North Atlantic, resulting in a continuation of above normal heights
over the Eastern Seaboard. Enhanced zonal flow is forecast across most of t=
he
western and central CONUS. Farther to the north and west, a high amplitude
flow
pattern is forecast to continue across Alaska.

Below normal temperatures are favored for Alaska associated with mean
troughing
predicted over Alaska. Below normal temperatures are also favored for parts=
 of
the northwestern CONUS, as a trough progresses through the region during th=
e
period. Conversely, near and above normal temperatures are favored for the
remainder CONUS, associated with predicted zonal flow and near to above nor=
mal
heights.

A drier pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians downstream the riding over the Bering Sea. Elevate=
d
probabilities of above normal precipitation are favored over the Alaska
Panhandle due to predicted troughing. With enhanced Pacific flow expected,
increased odds of above normal precipitation are indicated for the
northwestern
CONUS extending eastward to the Northern Plains. Below normal precipitation=
 is
most likely for much of the southwestern CONUS and parts of the Southern an=
d
Central Plains, well to the south of the predicted mean storm track.  Above
normal precipitation is favored for most of the eastern CONUS, due to the
potential for return flow moisture advecting northward to the west of surfa=
ce
high pressure forecast over the Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below Average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted significant weakening of the AO/NAO signal during the period.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 11 2022

SYNOPSIS: The jet stream pattern is forecast to become more progressive dur=
ing
week-2. Surface low pressure is anticipated to form over the Northeast
Pacific,
supporting enhanced moisture flow to coastal parts of the northwestern
contiguous U.S. (CONUS) which will bring heavy precipitation to some of the=
se
areas at the beginning of the period, with heavy snow anticipated in the
higher
elevations of the Cascades. Heavy snow is also possible in the higher
elevations in areas of the northern Rockies as this system moves through.
Meanwhile, a series of surface lows are predicted to drop southward from
Canada
into the Central Plains. During the early to middle part of week-2, one sto=
rm
system will strengthen significantly in the South-central Plains and move
slowly northeastward. This increases the chances for high winds over a broa=
d
area reaching from the Intermountain West eastward into the Great Plains. O=
ver
Alaska, an amplified trough centered over the central Mainland early in the
period will enhance probabilities for extreme cold over most of the central
and
southern Mainland.



HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across portions of the Pacific Northwest
and
northwestern California, Sat-Tue, Mar 19-22.

Slight risks of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Cascades, Sat-S=
un,
Mar 19-20.

Slight risk of heavy snow for parts of the Northern Rockies, Sat-Mon, Mar 1=
9-
21.

Slight risk of high winds across much of the Rockies and Plains, Sun-Tue, M=
ar
20-22.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of southern Mainlan=
d
Alaska, Sat-Mon, Mar 19-21.



DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 14 - FRIDAY MARCH 18:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=

CL3ENaHzcXI$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 19 - FRIDAY MARCH 25: Today's GEFS, ECMWF, and European
ensembles are in relatively good agreement indicating surface low pressure
intensifying over the Central Plains before moving eastward during the firs=
t
half of week-2, followed by a transition to a more zonal pattern aloft acro=
ss
the CONUS toward the end of the period. The operational Canadian model and =
the
Canadian ensembles were somewhat different, and they have lacked run-to-run
consistency, so today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook leans more on the=
 GEFS and ECMWF ensembles.



Predicted surface low formation over the North Pacific is anticipated to br=
ing
enhanced moisture flow to the northwestern CONUS at the beginning of the
period, with a weaker wave moving through around the middle of week-2. The
GEFS
and ECMWF ensembles indicate increased integrated vapor transport (IVT) val=
ues
over parts of the Pacific Northwest and northern California from the beginn=
ing
to middle of the period, although the signal is slightly weaker compared to
yesterday. This pattern supports a slight risk of heavy precipitation acros=
s
portions of the Pacific Northwest and northwestern California, Mar 19 to 22=
,
with the threat restricted to the northern half of the region as the second
wave moves through. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools also continue to
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulated precipitation exceeding
the
85th percentile of the climatological distribution and 1 inch over the regi=
on.
The slight risks of heavy snow are maintained in today's outlook over parts=
 of
the higher elevations of the Cascades, Mar 19 to 20, where the experimental
GEFS snow water equivalent (SWE) reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chanc=
e
of
3-day SWE exceeding the 85th (67th) percentile across the northern (souther=
n)
Cascades.



Meanwhile, strong surface low pressure is predicted to develop over the
South-Central Plains toward the middle of the period, which is farther sout=
h
than expected yesterday. As this feature develops, enhanced moisture flow f=
rom
the Pacific is also expected, supporting a slight risk of heavy snow across
parts of the Northern Rockies, Mar 19 to 21. The experimental GEFS SWE
reforecast tool depicts a similar signal to that in the Pacific Northwest,
showing at least a 20% chance of SWE exceeding the 85th percentile and half=
 an
inch (one inch locally) across the highlighted risk area.



As surface low pressure slowly intensifies across the central CONUS during =
the
middle of week-2, high winds are possible, affecting much of the highlighte=
d
risk area as the low transitions to the Plains, the shrinking to be focused
more toward the Central and Southern Plains as the system intensifies
Therefore, a slight risk of high winds is posted for much of the Great Plai=
ns
and Eastern Rockies, Mar 20 to 22. The GEFS reforecast tool limits the high
wind signal to the Northern Plains at the beginning of the period, whereas =
the
ECMWF reforecast tool indicates a broader area extending through the middle=
 of
the period. The ECMWF reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of wind
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph across the Central and
Southern
Plains, at times extending westward into the Rockies in association with je=
t
streaks moving into the mid-level trough from the west.



For Alaska, strong northeasterly surface flow over much of the central and
southern Mainland associated with strong surface low pressure over the Gulf=
 of
Alaska and surface high pressure sinking southward into the Mainland from t=
he
north supports the potential for extreme cold across parts of the Mainland.=
 A
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is indicated Mar 19 to 21, wh=
ere
the GEFS reforecast tools indicate a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling
below the 15th percentile. The European ensemble reforecast tools are less
bullish on chances for much below normal temperatures than they were
yesterday,
but the threat is indicated today based on the GEFS reforecast solution, gi=
ven
the run-to-run consistency.

346 PM EST Fri Mar 11 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 14 2022 - 12Z Fri Mar 18 2022

...Overview...
Two systems in progressive flow are noted over the Lower 48 next
week. The first system shifts east from the southern Plains and
through Southeast Monday night through Wednesday before turning
northeast, pushing off the southern Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday.
Meanwhile, an ongoing atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest
shifts down to the northern California coast Monday night ahead of
the next wave that crosses the Pacific Northwest coast Tuesday.
Much above normal temperatures will shift east over the central
and eastern U.S. between these two waves mid to late week,
offering spring-like temperatures reaching 10-20 above normal.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
Excellent agreement among the latest deterministic guidance is
noted in the in the main surface and 500mb features and evolution
through Wednesday. North-south waffling between guidance on the
progression/amplitude of the closed mid-level low over the
Southeast Tues-Wed have diminished, particularly with the 12Z GFS
that is a bit deeper and slower with the mid-level low compared to
the 06Z GFS which is in excellent agreement with the 00Z
ECMWF/CMC. The 00Z CMC is still slower starting Wednesday night
with the low tracking over the Carolina Coast, so a fairly evenly
distributed blend among the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and 06Z GFS into
Day 5 favors the 00Z CMC less with the addition of ensemble means
for Days 6/7 to replace the UKMET (which we only get 5 days worth
of data). Furthermore, the GFS is more amplified with the next
wave out West Wednesday night/Thursday while the ECMWF is less
amplified, so they are now in better agreement with each other.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
Low pressure over the southern Great Plains Monday night shifts to
the Gulf coast shifts across the lower MS Valley into Tuesday and
over the Gulf Coast/Southeast mid-week. This system should draw up
ample Gulf moisture ahead of it and could combine with sufficient
instability to bring widespread thunderstorms capable of producing
heavy rainfall, especially along/near the Gulf Coast region. With
a bit of a slower solution to the low, there is now a marginal
threat for excessive rain over north Florida Tuesday/Tuesday night
which is an area currently receiving heavy rain and already had
above normal rainfall over the past week going into today. The
atmospheric river is fairly progressive Monday night into Tuesday
as it pushes across northern California, bringing beneficial
rainfall and heavy elevation snowfall.
A taste of spring-like temperatures is generally expected for much
of the central to eastern U.S. next week under the ridge between
the two systems. Daytime highs reach 10 to 20 degrees above normal
on Tuesday over the Northern Plains, slowly shifting across the
Great Lakes to the Northeast through Friday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1237 AM CST Sat Mar 12 2022

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A strong upper-level trough will exit the eastern coast early in the
day today. In the West, upper-level ridging will shift across the
Great Basin into the High Plains. Surface high pressure and cold air
will continue to filter southward into the Gulf basin. A shortwave
trough within northwesterly flow across the Divide will promote lee
troughing in parts of the High Plains.

A dry low-level airmass will be situated across the Southwest into
the southern Plains. Surface winds in the southern Plains will shift
back to southwesterly along the western flank of the surface high.
With modest lee troughing to the west, a few hours of around 15 mph
winds and 15-20% RH are possible. Due to recent precipitation and
cold temperatures, fire weather concerns are expected to remain low
as fine-fuel moisture will remain elevated.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 AM CST Sat Mar 12 2022

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will continue to move eastward through the
Plains on Sunday. Farther west, a shortwave trough will dig south
and eastward out of the Pacific Northwest. This trough will reach
the southern High Plains by the end of the period. At the surface,
the airmass across the southern Plains will continue to modify.
Moisture return is expected to occur during the day and may impact
the southern extent of fire weather concerns in the Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
The shortwave trough approaching from the west will promote lee
troughing in the southern and central High Plains. Surface winds
from eastern New Mexico into western portions of Texas and Oklahoma
will increase to 15-25 mph. The highest wind speeds are expected in
the Texas Panhandle into central Oklahoma. There is a consistent
signal for RH to fall to 10-20% in guidance. As mentioned, some
moisture return is expected to increase RH from south to north
during the day. Critical fire weather is expected in the Texas
Panhandle, western Oklahoma, and parts of western North Texas.

Elevated to near Critical conditions are possible from the I-35
corridor into eastern Oklahoma and southern Kansas. With recent
snowfall, however, there is remaining uncertainty as to how dry fine
fuels will be to being the day on Sunday. For this reason,
highlights have not been expanded into these areas.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 AM EST Sat Mar 12 2022

Valid 12Z Tue Mar 15 2022 - 12Z Sat Mar 19 2022

...Overview...
Several organized systems are noted over the Lower 48 next week in
split flow. A leading southern stream system will progress from
the lower MS Valley through the Southeast Tuesday/Wednesday before
lifting northeast and off the southern Mid-Atlantic coast Thursday
in a wet pattern. Another weather focusing upper trough will reach
the West Coast Tuesday with a northern component pushing eastward
along the U.S./Canadian border mid-later next week as a separate
southern stream system meanwhile progresses over the U.S. southern
tier that may lead to frontal wave genesis and an increasingly
moist pattern into the east-central U.S. heading into next
weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...
12 UTC model and ensemble solutions overall seem reasonably well
clustered Tuesday into Friday and a composite of the
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC NBM provides a good
forecast starting point in a pattern with below normal forecast
spread. The 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF provide a slightly less progressive
solution than the 18 UTC GEFS/GEFS , especially with the lead
southern stream system that seems to make sense given flow
separation and closed low nature. Latest 00 UTC model and ensemble
guidance trends seems supportive of this slightly less progressive
solution. Model run to run continuity degrades into days 6/7 and a
transition to a blend of best clustered guidance from 12 UTC
GFS/ECMWF with the 12 UTC GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means seems
reasonable.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...
Low pressure shifts to the lower MS Valley into Tuesday and over
the Gulf Coast/Southeast mid-week. This system should draw up
ample Gulf moisture ahead of it and could combine with sufficient
instability to bring widespread thunderstorms capable of producing
heavy rainfall, especially along/near the Gulf Coast region. With
a bit of a slower solution to the low, there is some threat for
excessive rain over north Florida Tuesday/Tuesday night which is
an area currently receiving heavy rain and already had above
normal rainfall over the past week going into today. The
atmospheric river is fairly progressive Monday night into Tuesday
as it pushes across northern California, bringing beneficial
rainfall and heavy elevation snowfall, with activity spread inland
across the West with system progression.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0949 AM CST Wed Feb 17 2021

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Recent surface observations from the
lower CO river valley and southern AZ show relative humidity values
already in the low 20s and teens for a few locations. Further RH
reductions are expected as drier air moves in this afternoon.
Additionally, 25-35 mph low to mid-level flow is noted in morning
soundings and analyses, which supports the wind forecast outlined in
the previous discussion below. However, recent fuel guidance
continues to show near seasonal ERC values across the region, which
will limit the fire weather threat.

..Moore.. 02/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1243 AM CST Wed Feb 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
The broad trough across the Continental Divide will slowly shift
eastward today. A strengthening mid-level jet is expected to impact
portions of the Desert Southwest. At the surface, a pressure trough
will deepen within southern Arizona and New Mexico ahead of an
advancing cold airmass in the Plains. Typical dry conditions in the
lower Colorado River Valley and vicinity are probable during the
afternoon with RH falling to around 15% in some locations. The
strong jet aloft and surface pressure gradient will increase surface
winds to 15-25 mph. Sparse and marginally dry fuels preclude
highlights. High pressure in the Great Basin will drive offshore
flow in southern California, though fuel conditions will limit any
concern. Elsewhere across the CONUS, fire weather concerns will be
minimal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1249 PM CST Wed Feb 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Despite low humidity over the lower
CO river valley, recent guidance continues to show low potential for
widespread and/or prolonged elevated conditions due to weak surface
winds (generally below 15 mph). Localized elevated wind/RH
conditions remain possible early Thursday for the higher terrain of
the southern CA coast, but as mentioned in the previous discussion
below, marginal fuel status will limit fire weather concerns.

..Moore.. 02/17/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1244 AM CST Wed Feb 17 2021/

...Synopsis...
High pressure from the northern Rockies into the Plains will be the
primary surface feature for Thursday's forecast. A prolonged period
of cold temperatures and precipitation will keep fire weather
concerns quite low across most of the country. For early Thursday
morning, the offshore pressure gradient in southern California will
be maximized. While winds will be moderate with humidities reduced
to around 20% in spots, marginally receptive fuels will limit a more
robust risk for fire ignitions and spread.

...Much below normal temperatures over the southern Plains and
east-central U.S. to moderate and shift eastward this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Progressive mean flow over most of the lower 48 will finally bring
an end to the record cold airmass that has plagued the Central
U.S. for several days. The pattern will also promote the
continuation of an active weather period for the Pacific Northwest
into next week with persistent onshore flow and a series of
shortwave troughs/impulses. Individual features will include a
leading upper trough that will depart from the eastern U.S. this
weekend, followed by the next trough which should enter the
Northwest by this weekend and amplify somewhat into the Central
U.S. before continuing through the East early next week (with
associated surface system). Then a strong jet reaching into the
Northwest U.S. and western Canada around the start of next week
will push a frontal system across the northern tier states. A
shortwave dropping through the Northeast Pacific should reach the
West around the middle of next week, possibly supporting some
waviness and eventually a renewed southward push of the trailing
part of the northern tier front.

Latest guidance is still in reasonable synoptic agreement through
the period. At some valid times GFS runs are a bit sharper and
slower than the majority of solutions with the upper trough
crossing the lower 48 from the weekend into early next week, and
likewise a bit slower for the associated Plains-Great Lakes
wave/trailing front. However by early Tuesday the clustering is
good for a compact coastal system to be just off New England, with
the 00Z ECMWF gravitating toward consensus by trending
weaker/eastward from its prior run. Some discrepancies persist for
the timing and/or amplitude of upper troughing reaching the West
after Monday, involving the strength of a leading shortwave
(GFS/GEFS weakest) and specifics of a trailing shortwave dropping
into the West from the northeastern Pacific. Small scale of the
leading feature and increasing model/ensemble divergence for flow
upstream from the second shortwave suggest fairly low
predictability as far as resolving which side of the envelope may
be more likely, favoring an intermediate solution for the time
being. Thus the operational model blend (00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and
06Z GFS) used for the first half of the period transitions to a
model/ensemble mean combination later in the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will see the heaviest
precipitation during the period as a couple of fronts and
persistent onshore flow contribute to multiple episodes of coastal
rain and heavy mountain snow. Expect the highest totals to be over
favored terrain in the Olympics and Washington Cascades (some
liquid equivalent totals of 5" or greater possible for the
five-day period) with some significant totals reaching into parts
of western Oregon. The Plains into Great Lakes/New England low
pressure and associated fronts should produce some moderate wintry
precipitation on the northern side of the moisture shield, most
likely from the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to
moderate rain are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will
be possible in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system.

Temperatures will still be up to 10-25F below normal from parts of
the southern Plains into the lower Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic
Saturday. Some anomalies exceeding 10F below normal will persist
over the East into Sunday while an upstream front will bring
moderately below normal readings from the West into the
east-central U.S. during the weekend into early next week. The
northern tier states should see temperatures rise the farthest
above normal during the first half of next week with some
locations up to 15-20F above normal. Also during Monday-Wednesday
the southwestern states could see highs up to 10-15F above normal.

...Much below normal temperatures over the southern Plains and
east-central U.S. to moderate and shift eastward this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Progressive mean flow over most of the lower 48 will finally bring
an end to the record cold airmass that has plagued the Central
U.S. for several days. The pattern will also promote the
continuation of an active weather period for the Pacific Northwest
into next week with persistent onshore flow and a series of
shortwave troughs/impulses. Individual features will include a
leading upper trough that will depart from the eastern U.S. this
weekend, followed by the next trough which should enter the
Northwest by this weekend and amplify somewhat into the Central
U.S. before continuing through the East early next week (with
associated surface system). Then a strong jet reaching into the
Northwest U.S. and western Canada around the start of next week
will push a frontal system across the northern tier states. A
shortwave dropping through the Northeast Pacific should reach the
West around the middle of next week, possibly supporting some
waviness and eventually a renewed southward push of the trailing
part of the northern tier front.

Latest guidance is still in reasonable synoptic agreement through
the period. At some valid times GFS runs are a bit sharper and
slower than the majority of solutions with the upper trough
crossing the lower 48 from the weekend into early next week, and
likewise a bit slower for the associated Plains-Great Lakes
wave/trailing front. However by early Tuesday the clustering is
good for a compact coastal system to be just off New England, with
the 00Z ECMWF gravitating toward consensus by trending
weaker/eastward from its prior run. Some discrepancies persist for
the timing and/or amplitude of upper troughing reaching the West
after Monday, involving the strength of a leading shortwave
(GFS/GEFS weakest) and specifics of a trailing shortwave dropping
into the West from the northeastern Pacific. Small scale of the
leading feature and increasing model/ensemble divergence for flow
upstream from the second shortwave suggest fairly low
predictability as far as resolving which side of the envelope may
be more likely, favoring an intermediate solution for the time
being. Thus the operational model blend (00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and
06Z GFS) used for the first half of the period transitions to a
model/ensemble mean combination later in the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will see the heaviest
precipitation during the period as a couple of fronts and
persistent onshore flow contribute to multiple episodes of coastal
rain and heavy mountain snow. Expect the highest totals to be over

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 17 2021

SYNOPSIS: Week-2 looks to be fairly quiet in terms of hazardous weather
potential. Mid-level high pressure is forecast to build across the Southeas=
t,
helping to push the prevailing storm track north and help limit any Gulf
moisture availability. Mid-level low pressure is forecast to slide east fro=
m
Alaska into western Canada early in the period. This shift across the highe=
r
latitudes could see a limited amount of cold air descend into interior
portions
of the West.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Great Bas=
in
and Northern and Central Rockies, Thu-Sun, Feb 25-28.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for portions of the Brooks Ra=
nge
and Yukon Valley of Alaska, Thu-Fri, Feb 25-26.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 20 - WEDNESDAY FEBRUARY 24:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!o7a3kWymxFRi3u12zxhETyohMv6XMrPD76yuN14rkCu2L4FZ2ZQHxThuTFWUJ=
mYt42OojDq2$

FOR THURSDAY FEBRUARY 25 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 03: Model guidance continues to
trend toward a more robust anomalous 500-hPa ridge building over the
southeastern CONUS during Week-2. While such a pattern is likely to limit c=
old
weather potential for much of the country, it also tends toward quieter
weather
by displacing the storm track northward and limiting Gulf moisture
availability
for any systems over the eastern half of the nation. This shift is reflecte=
d
in
forecasts of the Arctic Oscillation trending positive and negative 500-hPa
height anomalies forecast across much of Canada, although some anomalous
troughing is also anticipated over the Intermountain West.



A slight risk of much below-normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Central Rockies on Feb 25-28. This cold =
air
is tied to the aforementioned anomalous troughing lying west of the growing
subtropical ridge. Reforecast guidance shows a more expansive and colder
signal
in the GEFS compared to the ECMWF, with the highlighted dates and region
representing the most substantial overlap of chances for overnight lows to
fall
within the bottom 15% of climatology. Despite being the most bullish model =
on
cold potential, GEFS ensemble mean temperature anomalies only range from -5=
 to
-10 degrees F across the highlighted area, reinforcing the need for only a
slight risk.



The high-latitude troughing continues to be tied to potential for much
below-normal temperatures over mainland Alaska. Reforecast guidance signals
have continued to show the chance for temperatures below -40 decreasing,
resulting in the moderate risk for much below-normal temperatures featured =
in
recent outlooks timing off. Instead, only a slight risk for much below-norm=
al
temperatures is posted for the Brooks Range and immediately adjacent portio=
ns
of the Yukon Valley on the 25th and 26th. The GEFS and ECMWF continues to s=
how
a 20-30% chance of temperatures below -40 on these dates, before the bulk o=
f
the coldest air slides east into Canada. The waning cold air is tied to
low-level flow having an increasing component out of the south that helps t=
o
moderate temperatures and bring increased Pacific moisture to the southern
half
of the state. Despite this, no clear signals emerge for any heavy
precipitation
or high wind hazards.

...Much below normal temperatures over the southern Plains and
east-central U.S. to moderate and shift eastward this weekend...

...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Progressive mean flow over most of the lower 48 will finally bring
an end to the record cold airmass that has plagued the Central
U.S. for several days. The pattern will also promote the
continuation of an active weather period for the Pacific Northwest
into next week with persistent onshore flow and a series of
shortwave troughs/impulses. Individual features will include a
leading upper trough that will depart from the eastern U.S. this
weekend, followed by the next trough which should enter the
Northwest by this weekend and amplify somewhat into the Central
U.S. before continuing through the East early next week (with
associated surface system). Then a strong jet reaching into the
Northwest U.S. and western Canada around the start of next week
will push a frontal system across the northern tier states. A
shortwave dropping through the Northeast Pacific should reach the
West around the middle of next week, possibly supporting some
waviness and eventually a renewed southward push of the trailing
part of the northern tier front.

Latest guidance is still in reasonable synoptic agreement through
the period. At some valid times GFS runs are a bit sharper and
slower than the majority of solutions with the upper trough
crossing the lower 48 from the weekend into early next week, and
likewise a bit slower for the associated Plains-Great Lakes
wave/trailing front. However by early Tuesday the clustering is
good for a compact coastal system to be just off New England, with
the 00Z ECMWF gravitating toward consensus by trending
weaker/eastward from its prior run. Some discrepancies persist for
the timing and/or amplitude of upper troughing reaching the West
after Monday, involving the strength of a leading shortwave
(GFS/GEFS weakest) and specifics of a trailing shortwave dropping
into the West from the northeastern Pacific. Small scale of the
leading feature and increasing model/ensemble divergence for flow
upstream from the second shortwave suggest fairly low
predictability as far as resolving which side of the envelope may
be more likely, favoring an intermediate solution for the time
being. Thus the operational model blend (00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and
06Z GFS) used for the first half of the period transitions to a
model/ensemble mean combination later in the forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will see the heaviest
precipitation during the period as a couple of fronts and
persistent onshore flow contribute to multiple episodes of coastal
rain and heavy mountain snow. Expect the highest totals to be over
favored terrain in the Olympics and Washington Cascades (some
liquid equivalent totals of 5" or greater possible for the
five-day period) with some significant totals reaching into parts
of western Oregon. The Plains into Great Lakes/New England low
pressure and associated fronts should produce some moderate wintry
precipitation on the northern side of the moisture shield, most
likely from the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to
moderate rain are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will
be possible in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system.

Temperatures will still be up to 10-25F below normal from parts of
the southern Plains into the lower Great Lakes and Mid-Atlantic
Saturday. Some anomalies exceeding 10F below normal will persist
over the East into Sunday while an upstream front will bring
moderately below normal readings from the West into the
east-central U.S. during the weekend into early next week. The
northern tier states should see temperatures rise the farthest
above normal during the first half of next week with some
locations up to 15-20F above normal. Also during Monday-Wednesday
the southwestern states could see highs up to 10-15F above normal.

...Major winter storm to impact Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...

...Rain/freezing rain to develop over parts of the Southern Plains
into the Lower Mississippi Valley and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast...

...Much below-average temperatures continue to hold on over the
Central/Southern Plains into the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast tonight into Thursday morning and over the
Southeast into Friday morning...

Low pressure over the Northern Gulf of Mexico will move
northeastward over the Southeast by Thursday evening.
Simultaneously, a second low along the Southeast Coast will move
northward along the Southeast Coast until moving off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast on Thursday evening into Friday.  Moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico will overrun the boundary bringing moist air
over very cold surface temperatures over the Southern Plains to
the Southeast and Ohio/Tennessee Valleys.  A major winter storm
will track from the Lower Mississippi Valley this evening into the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Thursday night, containing
threats for significant ice (rain/freezing rain), sleet, and heavy
snow.  Total ice accumulations of 0.25" to 0.5" (locally higher)
are expected from Eastern Texas into Northern Louisiana and
Western Mississippi through late tonight before the storm tracks
northeastward.  There is increasing potential for 0.25" to 0.5"
(locally higher) ice accumulations across South-Central Virginia,
a region still recovering from a major ice storm that occurred
this past weekend.

A swath of snow will develop from parts of the Lower
Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys northeastward to the Mid-Atlantic
and the Northeast, with the heaviest snow expected over the
Mid-Atlantic and Central Appalachians.   There will be significant
travel disruption in both the snow and ice areas with concern for
further/extended power outages for areas already experiencing
power outages with the storm.

Meanwhile, rain and showers/thunderstorms will develop over parts
of the Central Gulf Coast moving into the Southeast on Thursday.
The SPC issued a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast from tonight into Thursday morning.  The
severe thunderstorms' main hazards will be frequent lightning,
damaging severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes
through Thursday morning.  The severe weather Risk will continue
over parts of the Southeast through Friday morning.  Furthermore,
light snow will develop over the Great Lakes on Thursday morning,
continuing through Friday.  Also, overnight Thursday, snow will
develop over parts of New England.

In the meantime, light snow will develop over parts of the
Northern Intermountain Region/Great Basin into the Rockies tonight
into Thursday afternoon before mainly ending.  Later on Thursday,
a front will move onshore over the Northwest, moving inland to the
Northern Rockies/Great Basin into California by Friday evening.
The system will produce rain and higher elevation snow over the
Pacific Northwest/Northern California on Thursday evening.  The
snow will expand into the Northern Rockies and Great Basin on
Friday.  The coastal rain and higher elevation snow will continue
through Friday evening.  The Arctic air will also continue over
the Plains and Mississippi Valley with temperatures of 25 to 40
degrees below average.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed February 17 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 23 - 27 2021

Today's model solutions are in fair agreement in regards to the 500-hPa
pattern
across much of North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. The AO index has recently risen above zero and is forecast to remai=
n
positive during this outlook period. The resulting mean 500-hPa pattern
reflects below normal heights across most of the higher latitudes of North
America, allowing heights to rise farther to the south across much of the
CONUS. Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa trough over the western CONUS.
Upstream of this trough, ridging is forecast over the Alaska Peninsula and
southwestern Mainland Alaska. The manual height blend depicts negative heig=
ht
anomalies for much of the northern tier of CONUS and northeastern Mainland
Alaska. Positive height anomalies are forecast across the southern tier of
CONUS, as well as southwestern Mainland Alaska to the eastern Aleutians.
Today's manual 500-hPa height blend favors the GEFS-based solutions, due
primarily to considerations of recent skill.

Probabilities of below-normal temperatures are enhanced across much of
Mainland
Alaska as  a lobe of the Polar Vortex and associated below normal heights
extends across much of the state. Above normal temperatures are favored for
the
Aleutians, due to  predicted ridging. As troughing and below normal heights
retreat northward to higher latitudes, a dramatic warmup from current level=
s
is
likely across much of the central and eastern CONUS as the flow pattern
becomes
more zonal. Farther to the south, above normal temperatures are favored for
parts of the Southern High Plains westward to parts of Southern California,
underneath predicted above normal heights.

An increased pressure gradient is expected to promote enhanced Pacific flow
across the northwestern CONUS, leading to elevated chances of above normal
precipitation. Farther to the south, surface high pressure and rising 500-h=
Pa
heights favor drier than normal conditions across the southwestern CONUS
extending eastward to the Southern and Central Plains. Conversely, above
normal
precipitation is likely across parts of the Great Lakes underneath predicte=
d
cyclonic flow. Ridging and associated surface high pressure are expected
farther to the south and east, favoring below normal precipitation for the
Southeast and the Middle Atlantic States. Strong ridging across the Aleutia=
ns
is forecast to push the storm track further north than normal, resulting in
elevated chances of above normal  precipitation across most of Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% =
of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fa=
ir
agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS, as well as the surfac=
e
pattern evolution across Alaska.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 25 - MAR 03, 2021

During the week-2 period, an amplified 500-hPa trough is forecast across th=
e
western CONUS with below normal heights. Downstream, ridging is forecast to
dominate the eastern CONUS with above normal heights.  Across Alaska, as
ridging builds northward from the Pacific and heights rise, above normal
heights are forecast over much of the Aleutians and suthwestern Mainland,
while
below normal heights are expected over the remainder of Alaska. The week-2
manual 500-hPa height blend favors the GEFS-based solutions, consistent wit=
h
the preceding 6-10 day period.

Forecast height rises lead to increased chances of near to above normal
temperatures across southern Alaska. Toughing favors below normal temperatu=
res
for the remainder of Alaska and across the western CONUS. Above normal
temperatures are likely for much of the remainder of the CONUS as a mean ri=
dge
gains strength over the Southeastern CONUS.

There are  elevated chances of above normal precipitation across Alaska ahe=
ad
of a mean trough predicted near the western Aleutians. Above normal
precipitation is also likely for much of the Great Lakes, Ohio and Tennesse=
e
Valleys, parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley, and the Northeast. This is
consistent with both dynamical model guidance as well as La Nina composites=
.
Drier than normal conditions are likely for much of the western CONUS, the
Northern and Central High Plains, and parts of the Southeast, as a combinat=
ion
of above normal heights and surface high pressure are forecast to influence
much of these regions.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20=
%
of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good tool agreement, offset by increasing uncertainty in regards to the
precipitation forecast over the CONUS


FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 18.

...Powerful Pacific storm to deliver heavy rain and gusty winds to
the Pacific Northwest, Slight Risks for Excessive Rainfall in
Northern California and far southwestern Oregon today...

...Severe thunderstorms possible in some eastern regions due to a
low pressure system tracking through the Great Lakes today;
scattered thunderstorms also possible in portions of the Southern
Plains today and Friday...

...Abnormally warm conditions in the Rockies and High Plains; warm
day along the East Coast today gives way to cooler temps by week's
end; cooler in the Midwest and along the West Coast...

A rapidly deepening cyclone in the northeast Pacific responsible
for the development of an atmospheric river aimed at the West
Coast and coastal British Columbia is set to produce unsettled
weather that will arrive in the Pacific Northwest later today. The
bouts of rain are a sight for sore eyes in the drought stricken
areas of the Northwest with beneficial rainfall totals ranging
between 2 to 5 inches in the higher elevations of Northern
California and southwestern Oregon. However, locally heavy
rainfall rates atop burn scarred areas could lead to flash
flooding, rapid runoff, and debris flows in these locations.
Slight Risks for Excessive Rainfall have been issued for a handful
of areas in Northern California and far southwestern Oregon along
with Flash Flood Watches in parts of the northern Sierra Nevada.
As the upper low associated with this Pacific storm moves ashore
Thursday night, snow levels will drop throughout the night and
into Friday as it also aids in pushing precipitation farther
inland. Despite the falling snow levels, snow totals will
generally be light with the lone exceptions being the highest
peaks of mountain ranges that include the northern Sierra Nevada,
the Shastas, and the Cascades. As the storm system pushes into the
northern Rockies and gradually weakens, the next Pacific low
pressure system is hot on its heels as it ushers in more unsettled
weather into the Pacific Northwest on Saturday.

Meanwhile, a vigorous upper level disturbance in the Midwest early
this morning will track east underneath a large upper low spinning
over northern Ontario. The surface low is forecast to strengthen
as it tracks through the Great Lakes and its associated cold front
sweeps across the Ohio Valley and Mid-South. Thunderstorms firing
out ahead of the cold front could be severe, prompting the Storm
Prediction Center to issue a Marginal risk for severe weather from
the eastern Great Lakes on south into the Tennessee Valley. Severe
storms are also possible in West Texas where a modestly unstable
air-mass will be in place. After spotty showers and thunderstorms
track through the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic Thursday night, the
cold front reaches the East Coast by Friday afternoon. Some severe
storms could occur in eastern North Carolina and South Florida
Friday afternoon. Farther west, a warm front pushing north through
the Southern Plains could trigger hit-or-miss showers and
thunderstorms Friday afternoon and into Friday night.

Temperatures will be warmest in the Intermountain West and Great
Plains as upper level ridging builds aloft downwind of the robust
upper trough in the northeast Pacific. Friday's high temps will be
quite warm from the Southern Plains to the plains of Montana. The
hottest temperatures are expected along the Rio Grande River where
highs could hit 90 degrees. The East Coast rebounds to more
September-like levels of heat today before the aforementioned cold
front sends a shot or more autumn-like conditions, currently
located in the Midwest, into the Great Lakes and Northeast for
Friday and into the upcoming weekend. Expect the Deep South to
remain on the abnormally warm side through the end of the
work-week. Lastly, the West Coast will contend with persistent
cloud cover thanks to the series of systems causing onshore flow.
Temperatures ranging between 5 to 15 degrees cooler than average
are expected with the coldest anomalies focused in Northern
California.

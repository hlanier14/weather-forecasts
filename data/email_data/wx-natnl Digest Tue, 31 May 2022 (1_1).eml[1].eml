Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1115 AM CDT Mon May 30 2022

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NEW MEXICO INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Minimal changes were made to the ongoing forecast. Strong wind gusts
(30-50 mph) are currently occurring in the lee of the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains and areas to the east. These strong gusts will
continue until at least the early afternoon until the mid-level jet
moves farther northeast. These areas are the most likely to
experience extremely critical meteorological conditions today. With
fuels have received some recent precipitation, fire weather concerns
will be mitigated to some extent.

..Wendt.. 05/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0117 AM CDT Mon May 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, a fast-moving upper trough will mature as it
ejects quickly northeastward across the Plains and upper Midwest. A
belt of stronger flow will move with the trough, overspreading much
of the Southwest, Southern Rockies and High Plains Monday. At the
surface, a lee low will rapidly deepen, pulling a cold front south
toward the Four Corners. The overlap of strong winds and low
humidity will support elevated and critical fire weather concerns
across New Mexico and the High Plains.

...New Mexico and the central and southern High Plains...
As the mid-level trough quickly ejects to the north and east, 60-80
kt mid-level flow will bolster low-level southwesterly flow across
much of NM onto the High Plains. Widespread 20-30 mph surface winds
should extended northeastward as far as western KS in the wake of
the fast moving lee low and trailing dryline. Downslope drying of
the warm continental airmass should result in widespread sub 15%
humidity, with a few pockets below 10% also possible. While fuels
have been somewhat moderated by recent precipitation farther to the
east, higher-end critical meteorological conditions suggest high
confidence in critical fire weather concerns through this evening.

...Northern California...
As the upper-level trough departs to the east, strong mid-level flow
will turn more northerly across much of the West Coast. Low-level
downvalley winds are forecast to increase in response to the flow
aloft across the northern Sacramento Valley and surrounding
foothills. Downslope drying and relatively warm conditions should
support RH below 20%, along with surface winds of 15-20 mph. The dry
nature of area fuels suggests elevated fire weather conditions are
likely.

...Weekend heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...
Recent model guidance is in reasonably good agreement for the
overall synoptic pattern, with the exception of the 06z GFS being
a little farther south with a deep layer cyclone in south-central
Canada.  There is better agreement with the upper low/trough
edging into the West from the Pacific.  Notable differences
continue to be seen near FL this weekend with the system at least
partially due to northeast Pacific Hurricane Agatha's remnants.
Models continue to show the potential for low pressure in the Bay
of Campeche/Yucatan/northwestern Caribbean to deepen as it
approaches FL with a general northeast track.  GFS and Canadian
model runs continue to be on the fast side of the envelope, with
the ECMWF on the slower side.  When this typical distribution is
seen with any recurving low, a compromise is preferred, though did
lean somewhat towards the 00z ECMWF as a precaution late in the
period as it starts to interact with a frontal zone.  See NHC
tropical weather outlooks for more on this system's potential for
development.  Used a compromise of the deterministic guidance for
placement of features/pressures/preferred 500 hPa height
pattern/winds early, before using increasing amounts of ensemble
mean with time to take into account uncertainty.  The remainder of
the grids are a more even blend of guidance similar to the 13z
National Blend of Models.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...
Rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest during the
latter half of the week given the trough axis near the West Coast
and onshore flow. The Southwest should remain dry and hot, with
Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high temperatures
this weekend into early next week.

There is increasing forecast agreement for Hurricane Agatha over
the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across southeast Mexico
over the next 2-3 days while weakening. Showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida Friday and Saturday ahead of the remnant
disturbance, first with the moisture streaming northeast ahead of
the system and then with the surface low.  Moisture aloft from the
far eastern Pacific and lower level moisture from the Caribbean
should lead to heavy rainfall, even if the system's timing is in
question.  Even in the cyclone's wake, its convergent tail appears
to be stuck in the vicinity of South FL & the Keys, keeping the
threat of moderate to heavy rainfall in play into early next week.
 The experimental Day 5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook has a Slight
Risk for the Keys and South FL (June 3 12z-June 4 12z), after
favorable coordination with the KEY/Key West FL and MFL/Miami FL
forecast offices.

A cold front moves across the East late this week, with rain and
thunderstorms expected in its vicinity.  Areas of the eastern
Mid-Atlantic could see locally heavy rainfall and an isolated
flash flood threat Thursday, with a similar threat across portions
of the Carolinas on Friday.  Rain and thunderstorms are expected
in the vicinity of a front dropping south through the Southeast
and Gulf coast before returning northward into TX.  These fronts
will continue to spark additional rounds of enhanced rainfall
across the central U.S. this weekend near its tail with the usual
uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Thursday into Friday
with rain cooled air, but should switch to above normal in Texas
by about 10F by early next week. Periodic troughing in the
northern tier should lead to slightly below average temperatures
by 5-10F. The western U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F
late in the workweek but cooler temperatures are forecast by the
weekend under the troughing influence/as a cold front moves
through the area. Warm temperatures across the Southeast Thursday
will moderate closer to normal late week behind a cold frontal
passage.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
116 PM EDT Mon May 30 2022

Valid 12Z Thu Jun 02 2022 - 12Z Mon Jun 06 2022

...Weekend heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...
Recent model guidance is in reasonably good agreement for the
overall synoptic pattern, with the exception of the 06z GFS being
a little farther south with a deep layer cyclone in south-central
Canada.  There is better agreement with the upper low/trough
edging into the West from the Pacific.  Notable differences
continue to be seen near FL this weekend with the system at least
partially due to northeast Pacific Hurricane Agatha's remnants.
Models continue to show the potential for low pressure in the Bay
of Campeche/Yucatan/northwestern Caribbean to deepen as it
approaches FL with a general northeast track.  GFS and Canadian
model runs continue to be on the fast side of the envelope, with
the ECMWF on the slower side.  When this typical distribution is
seen with any recurving low, a compromise is preferred, though did
lean somewhat towards the 00z ECMWF as a precaution late in the
period as it starts to interact with a frontal zone.  See NHC
tropical weather outlooks for more on this system's potential for
development.  Used a compromise of the deterministic guidance for
placement of features/pressures/preferred 500 hPa height
pattern/winds early, before using increasing amounts of ensemble
mean with time to take into account uncertainty.  The remainder of
the grids are a more even blend of guidance similar to the 13z
National Blend of Models.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...
Rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest during the
latter half of the week given the trough axis near the West Coast
and onshore flow. The Southwest should remain dry and hot, with
Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high temperatures
this weekend into early next week.

There is increasing forecast agreement for Hurricane Agatha over
the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across southeast Mexico
over the next 2-3 days while weakening. Showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida Friday and Saturday ahead of the remnant
disturbance, first with the moisture streaming northeast ahead of
the system and then with the surface low.  Moisture aloft from the
far eastern Pacific and lower level moisture from the Caribbean
should lead to heavy rainfall, even if the system's timing is in
question.  Even in the cyclone's wake, its convergent tail appears
to be stuck in the vicinity of South FL & the Keys, keeping the
threat of moderate to heavy rainfall in play into early next week.
 The experimental Day 5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook has a Slight
Risk for the Keys and South FL (June 3 12z-June 4 12z), after
favorable coordination with the KEY/Key West FL and MFL/Miami FL
forecast offices.

A cold front moves across the East late this week, with rain and
thunderstorms expected in its vicinity.  Areas of the eastern
Mid-Atlantic could see locally heavy rainfall and an isolated
flash flood threat Thursday, with a similar threat across portions
of the Carolinas on Friday.  Rain and thunderstorms are expected
in the vicinity of a front dropping south through the Southeast
and Gulf coast before returning northward into TX.  These fronts
will continue to spark additional rounds of enhanced rainfall
across the central U.S. this weekend near its tail with the usual
uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Thursday into Friday
with rain cooled air, but should switch to above normal in Texas
by about 10F by early next week. Periodic troughing in the
northern tier should lead to slightly below average temperatures
by 5-10F. The western U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F
late in the workweek but cooler temperatures are forecast by the
weekend under the troughing influence/as a cold front moves
through the area. Warm temperatures across the Southeast Thursday
will moderate closer to normal late week behind a cold frontal
passage.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1234 PM CDT Mon May 30 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

Very minimal changes to the ongoing forecast. See the previous
discussion for more details.

..Wendt.. 05/30/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0119 AM CDT Mon May 30 2022/

...Synopsis...
In the wake of the departing mid-level trough, stronger flow aloft
should gradually weaken through the day, Tuesday, across the
southern Rockies and High Plains. At the same time, a surface cold
front will begin to move south, reaching southern CO and northern NM
by evening. Gusty winds will remain possible along and south of the
front supporting a few hours of elevated fire weather potential
Tuesday afternoon.

...Southern Rockies...
Residual flow aloft along the base of the departing trough should
linger over portions of the southern Rockies Tuesday. Beneath the
enhanced mid-level flow, a few hours of stronger surface winds along
and south of a slow moving surface cold front are possible. Dry
surface conditions will remain in place prior to the cold frontal
passage, with mean boundary-layer RH likely below 15%. Gusty surface
winds to 15-20 mph within the dry fuels may support a few hours of
elevated fire weather concerns. The fire weather threat will quickly
diminish with the passage of the cold front in the evening as
surface winds weaken and RH recovers.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 30 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 05 - 09 2022

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. An amplified longwave trough and associated below normal
500-hPa heights are predicted over the North Pacific. Weak positive 500-hPa
height anomalies are forecast over the western CONUS. Troughing with below
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted over the central and eastern CONUS.
Ridging associated above normal 500-hPa heights are also forecast over
Mainland
Alaska and Alaska Panhandle, while below normal 500-Hpa heights are forecas=
t
over the Aleutians.

Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of below
normal temperatures over parts of the Northern and Central Rockies, Norther=
n
and Central Plains, Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Upper Great Lakes,
and
Ohio Valley. Probabilities for above normal temperatures are elevated for t=
he
southern tier of the CONUS due to predicted above normal 500-hPa heights an=
d
low-level southerly flow over the region, consistent with the consolidation
temperatures forecast tool. Above normal temperatures are favored over Alas=
ka
under ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights.

Enhanced onshore flow and predicted trough over the eastern CONUS lead to
increased chances of near to above normal precipitation over most of the
northern tier of the CONUS, excerpt for northern Minnesota where slightly
below
normal precipitation is favored. Below normal precipitation is likely for
parts
of the Southern Rockies, Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley,
consistent with the consolidation precipitation forecast tool. Near to abov=
e
normal precipitation is slightly favored for Alaska, consistent with dynami=
cal
model precipitation tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 34% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 33% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 07 - 13 2022

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on th=
e
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
A 500-hPa trough and below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast over the Nort=
h
Pacific. A ridge with above normal 500-hPa height is predicted over the
western
CONUS, while a trough associated with below normal mid-level heights are
forecast over most of the Central and eastern CONUS. Above normal 500-hPa
heights are predicted over much of the Mainland Alaska and Alaska Panhandle=
,
while below normal 500-Hpa heights are forecast over the Aleutians.

Troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights lead to increased odds of below
normal temperatures over parts of the Northern and Central Plains, Upper an=
d
Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes region, Ohio Valley, Tennessee Valle=
y,
and portions of the Northeast. Probabilities for near to above normal
temperatures are elevated for the western and southern tier of the CONUS du=
e
to
predicted above normal 500-hPa heights and low-level southerly flow over th=
e
region, consistent with the consolidation temperatures forecast tool. Above
normal temperatures are favored over Alaska under ridging and above normal
500-hPa heights.

A ridge and above normal 500-hPa heights increase the likelihood of near to
below normal precipitation over parts of the Southern Plains and most of th=
e
western CONUS, except for Washington where slightly below normal precipitat=
ion
is favored. Predicted troughing over the eastern CONUS lead to increased
chances of near to above normal precipitation over parts of the Northern an=
d
Central Plains, and the eastern CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
precipitation forecast tool. Near to above normal precipitation is slightly
favored for Alaska, consistent with dynamical model precipitation tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 33% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 33% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 34% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above Average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern and in
the
forecast temperature and precipitation tools.


FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

SYNOPSIS: Week-2 will begin with a heat wave entrenched over the south-cent=
ral
Plains which will remain in place through at least the middle of the period=
.
After day 1 (Tue Jun 7), much above normal temperatures will expand into mu=
ch
of the western quarter of the Lower 48, raising the potential for excessive
heat in the lower elevations from the California Valleys southeastward thro=
ugh
southern Nevada and adjacent areas. Both heat threats should wane toward th=
e
end of week-2. Farther east, a southerly low-level flow of warm, moist air
from
the Gulf of Mexico will interact with a developing frontal system in the
central Plains, creating a slight risk of heavy precipitation from parts of
the
central Great Plains eastward into the middle Mississippi Valley. This haza=
rd
should also wane late in the period. And along the Atlantic Seaboard, there=
 is
a chance for a tropical or subtropical system to be near the Outer Banks ea=
rly
week-2, creating a threat for high winds.



HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across the central Great Plains and midd=
le
Mississippi Valley Tue-Thu, Jun 7-9..

Slight risk of high winds across the Outer Banks of North Carolina Tue-Thu,
Jun
7-9.

Slight risk of excessive heat across the Southern Great Plains, Tue-Fri, Ju=
n
7-10.

Slight risk of excessive heat across the central California Valleys, southe=
rn
Nevada, and adjacent lower elevations Wed-Sun, Jun 8-12.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North, northern
Minnesota, and much of the James River.





DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY JUNE 02 - MONDAY JUNE 06:

FOR TUESDAY JUNE 07 - MONDAY JUNE 13: All models and reforecast tools agree=
 in
principle that week-2 will begin with hot weather entrenched in the
south-central Great Plains. The GEFS tools and the operational GFS are more
bullish with the heat than the ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools as well as t=
he
operational ECMWF and GEPS. The excessive heat tool based on the GEFS bring=
s
significant chances that heat index values could approach 110=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BDF in parts of
interior eastern Texas during the peak of the hot spell. Even the more
reserved
European Model reforecast tools show heat index values approaching 105=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF.
This
heat wave should wane toward the end of week-2 as a more zonal mid-level fl=
ow
develops, moderating surface temperatures.



As week-2 gets underway, excessive heat also becomes a possibility in lower
elevations from the central California Valleys southeastward through southe=
rn
Nevada and adjacent Utah and Arizona. This heat builds as a mid-level ridge
pushes into the western CONUS, bringing well above normal temperatures to a
large area; however, in terms of hazards, they are restricted to the lower
elevations where temperatures will be the highest. This thread continues
through the middle of the period, but slowly decreases toward the end of
week-2
as the mid-level flow pattern changes. Models are in good agreement on this
general scenario, although there are some differences in magnitude and timi=
ng
between tools based on the GEFS and those derived from the ECMWF and
ensembles.



Farther east, most models show a southerly flow of warm, humid air pushing
toward a frontal system sitting over the central Plains and adjacent
Mississippi Valley. Models are not in good agreement on specifics, but all
raise at least the possibility of heavy precipitation. The GEFS is wetter t=
han
the ECMWF ensembles or GEPS, but those two also show a set-up that enhances
the
chance for heavy precipitation in the area, though they are not as wet with
their precipitation output.



There is an increased chance for tropical cyclone (TC) development near the
Yucatan Peninsula prior to week-2. This potential TC would most likely trac=
k
northeastward and be near or offshore the coastal Southeast by early next
week.
Models are not in good agreement on how this system will evolve. The Canadi=
an
pushes it well out to sea by the end of this week. The European cranks out =
a
strong system, but it remains away from the immediate coast. Meanwhile, the
GFS
brings a strong system into the Outer Banks. Despite significant disagreeme=
nt
among the models, all show a storm system of some time over or near the
Atlantic Seaboard, raising the slight chance for strong winds across the Ou=
ter
Banks. All models move the storm away from the country by the middle of
week-2.



River flooding is expected to continue along the Red River of the North and
adjacent bodies of water, and flooding is expected to expand southward alon=
g
the James River by the start of week-2.

...An outbreak of severe thunderstorms, tornadoes and heavy rain
will likely continue into tonight across parts of the northern
Plains and the upper Midwest ahead of an intensifying low pressure
system...

...Severe weather and heavy rain concerns will shift farther south
from Oklahoma to the lower Missouri Valley on Tuesday...

...Colder temperatures and unsettled weather will continue across
parts of the Intermountain West with locally heavy mountain snow
into tonight for the northern Rockies...

...Critical fire weather concerns will remain in place today
across the Southern Rockies and Southern High Plains...

A low pressure system currently intensifying and moving out of the
central Plains will be the main focus for additional outbreak of
severe weather and bursts of heavy rain through tonight.  The
heavy rain and severe thunderstorms are expected to expand
northward across the eastern portions of the Dakotas and into
Minnesota as the low pressure system interacts and derives more
energy from an active frontal boundary.  Given the very moist and
unstable air surging north ahead of a cold front, numerous severe
thunderstorms are expected to accompany with large to giant hail,
damaging winds and tornadoes, including the potential for a couple
of intense and long-track tornadoes, where the Storm Prediction
Center has highlighted a Moderate Risk of severe weather through
tonight.

In addition to the severe weather, the showers and thunderstorms
will produce heavy rainfall and there will be concerns for areas
of flash flooding across the central and northern Plains and
especially the Red River Valley area where the Weather Prediction
Center has indicated a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall.
Additional heavy rain is expected across parts of central and
eastern North Dakota and possibly reaching into parts of northwest
Minnesota as this low center approaches and crosses the region
through tonight.  By Tuesday, a rather deep and intense low
pressure system for late May is forecast to head into southern
Canada.  Strong gusty winds behind the system will push much
colder air south toward the central Plains.  Near and ahead of the
cold front, the threat for severe weather and locally heavy
rainfall is forecast to rapidly develop from Oklahoma
northeastward through the lower Missouri Valley later on Tuesday.
The front is forecast to become slow-moving on Wednesday when it
reaches into the southern Plains.  This will keep a good chance of
showers and thunderstorms in place from Oklahoma northeastward
into the evening.  Rounds of heavy rain and severe thunderstorms
are possible in the same general area into Wednesday evening.

Meanwhile, a broad upper trough is forecast to remain in place
across much of the Intermountain West through Tuesday, and this
will maintain a large area of much below normal temperatures and
unsettled weather.  In fact, heavy snowfall will continue into
tonight the higher terrain of the northern Rockies.  Storm total
snowfall amounts going through Tuesday of 1 to 3 feet are expected
for parts of the Absoroka and Big Horn mountains where the
heaviest precipitation is expected.  The snow is expected to
linger across the northern Rockies on Tuesday before slowly
spreading into the Colorado Rockies Tuesday night and early
Wednesday.

Some of the cooler temperatures across the West over the next
couple of days will be spilling down through the southern High
Plains and the southern Rockies which will be welcome news as
there remains at least one more day of critical fire weather
concerns given hot and very dry conditions along with gusty winds.
 As a cold front crosses the region, lowering temperatures will
help to reduce the fire danger heading toward the middle of the
week.

Elsewhere, aside from some scattered showers and thunderstorms
across the Florida Peninsula, and the Gulf Coast, generally dry
and tranquil weather will remain in place across the East for a
couple more days.  However, the heat and humidity will be on the
increase as high pressure offshore of the East Coast drives
southerly flow up from the Gulf of Mexico.  This will yield
widespread above normal temperatures with many areas seeing
temperatures ranging from the upper 80s to the mid 90s.  The front
upstream across the Plains and Midwest that will be driving severe
weather concerns over the next couple of days will encroach on the
East by midweek, and this will eventually increase the threat of
showers and thunderstorms.  While many areas of the East will be
briefly rather hot, cooler temperatures will be noted over New
England as a backdoor cold front slowly sinks south from southeast
Canada.

...Weekend heavy rain threat increasing over southern Florida
ahead of a tropical system...

...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...
Recent model guidance is in reasonably good agreement for the
overall synoptic pattern, with the exception of the 06z GFS being
a little farther south with a deep layer cyclone in south-central
Canada.  There is better agreement with the upper low/trough
edging into the West from the Pacific.  Notable differences
continue to be seen near FL this weekend with the system at least
partially due to northeast Pacific Hurricane Agatha's remnants.
Models continue to show the potential for low pressure in the Bay
of Campeche/Yucatan/northwestern Caribbean to deepen as it
approaches FL with a general northeast track.  GFS and Canadian
model runs continue to be on the fast side of the envelope, with
the ECMWF on the slower side.  When this typical distribution is
seen with any recurving low, a compromise is preferred, though did
lean somewhat towards the 00z ECMWF as a precaution late in the
period as it starts to interact with a frontal zone.  See NHC
tropical weather outlooks for more on this system's potential for
development.  Used a compromise of the deterministic guidance for
placement of features/pressures/preferred 500 hPa height
pattern/winds early, before using increasing amounts of ensemble
mean with time to take into account uncertainty.  The remainder of
the grids are a more even blend of guidance similar to the 13z
National Blend of Models.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...
Rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest during the
latter half of the week given the trough axis near the West Coast
and onshore flow. The Southwest should remain dry and hot, with
Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high temperatures
this weekend into early next week.

There is increasing forecast agreement for Hurricane Agatha over
the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across southeast Mexico
over the next 2-3 days while weakening. Showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida Friday and Saturday ahead of the remnant
disturbance, first with the moisture streaming northeast ahead of
the system and then with the surface low.  Moisture aloft from the
far eastern Pacific and lower level moisture from the Caribbean
should lead to heavy rainfall, even if the system's timing is in
question.  Even in the cyclone's wake, its convergent tail appears
to be stuck in the vicinity of South FL & the Keys, keeping the
threat of moderate to heavy rainfall in play into early next week.
 The experimental Day 5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook has a Slight
Risk for the Keys and South FL (June 3 12z-June 4 12z), after
favorable coordination with the KEY/Key West FL and MFL/Miami FL
forecast offices.

A cold front moves across the East late this week, with rain and
thunderstorms expected in its vicinity.  Areas of the eastern
Mid-Atlantic could see locally heavy rainfall and an isolated
flash flood threat Thursday, with a similar threat across portions
of the Carolinas on Friday.  Rain and thunderstorms are expected
in the vicinity of a front dropping south through the Southeast
and Gulf coast before returning northward into TX.  These fronts
will continue to spark additional rounds of enhanced rainfall
across the central U.S. this weekend near its tail with the usual
uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Thursday into Friday
with rain cooled air, but should switch to above normal in Texas
by about 10F by early next week. Periodic troughing in the
northern tier should lead to slightly below average temperatures
by 5-10F. The western U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F
late in the workweek but cooler temperatures are forecast by the
weekend under the troughing influence/as a cold front moves
through the area. Warm temperatures across the Southeast Thursday
will moderate closer to normal late week behind a cold frontal
passage.

Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high temperatures
this weekend into early next week.

There is increasing forecast agreement for Hurricane Agatha over
the eastern Pacific to move northeastward across southeast Mexico
over the next 2-3 days while weakening. Showers and thunderstorms
are expected to become more frequent and widespread across
southern Florida Friday and Saturday ahead of the remnant
disturbance, first with the moisture streaming northeast ahead of
the system and then with the surface low.  Moisture aloft from the
far eastern Pacific and lower level moisture from the Caribbean
should lead to heavy rainfall, even if the system's timing is in
question.  Even in the cyclone's wake, its convergent tail appears
to be stuck in the vicinity of South FL & the Keys, keeping the
threat of moderate to heavy rainfall in play into early next week.
 The experimental Day 5 Excessive Rainfall Outlook has a Slight
Risk for the Keys and South FL (June 3 12z-June 4 12z), after
favorable coordination with the KEY/Key West FL and MFL/Miami FL
forecast offices.

A cold front moves across the East late this week, with rain and
thunderstorms expected in its vicinity.  Areas of the eastern
Mid-Atlantic could see locally heavy rainfall and an isolated
flash flood threat Thursday, with a similar threat across portions
of the Carolinas on Friday.  Rain and thunderstorms are expected
in the vicinity of a front dropping south through the Southeast
and Gulf coast before returning northward into TX.  These fronts
will continue to spark additional rounds of enhanced rainfall
across the central U.S. this weekend near its tail with the usual
uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Thursday into Friday
with rain cooled air, but should switch to above normal in Texas
by about 10F by early next week. Periodic troughing in the
northern tier should lead to slightly below average temperatures
by 5-10F. The western U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F
late in the workweek but cooler temperatures are forecast by the
weekend under the troughing influence/as a cold front moves
through the area. Warm temperatures across the Southeast Thursday
will moderate closer to normal late week behind a cold frontal
passage.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0155 AM CDT Tue May 31 2022

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Within broad western US troughing, the main shortwave is forecast to
continues across the upper Midwest and into southern Canada
weakening overall troughing across the western CONUS. A second and
weaker wave embedded within the residual southwesterly flow will
pass over the central Rockies through the afternoon while a cold
front approaches. While flow aloft is forecast to gradually weaken
through the day, a few hours of gusty winds will likely remain
across NM and the southern High Pains supporting brief elevated fire
weather concerns.

...Northern New Mexico and southern Colorado...
Lingering mid-level flow behind the departing trough should support
gusty low-level winds near and south of a slow moving cold front
across the Four Corners and southern High Plains. Ahead of the
front, area soundings show a warm and well-mixed boundary layer with
RH of 10-20%. With surface winds expected to peak near 15-20 mph
elevated fire weather conditions appear possible through the
afternoon. Fire weather concerns will quickly subside later in the
evening with weakening winds and recovering humidity after the
frontal passage.

0157 AM CDT Tue May 31 2022

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
As mid-level western US troughing weakens ahead of shortwave ridging
developing along the West Coast, flow aloft over the Southwestern US
is forecast to slacken. At the surface, a cool upslope post-frontal
airmass should support large humidity recoveries and light winds
unsupportive of widespread fire weather concerns. The increase in
moisture may support isolated thunderstorm potential in the
afternoon along the eastern edge of the higher terrain. While a few
lightning strikes will be possible, relatively high PWATS and
limited storm coverage will be largely unsupportive of dry thunder
potential.

...Heavy rain threat increasing over Florida due to tropical
moisture inflow and a possibly forming tropical system...


...Overview...

While the overall pattern across much of the lower 48 will remain
fairly stagnant late week into early next week, with West Coast
troughing and a south-central Canada upper low sending some low
amplitude troughing across the central to eastern U.S. But the
main notable feature to watch during the medium range period will
be the possibility for a tropical cyclone to develop over the
northwestern Caribbean Sea/southeastern Gulf of Mexico partially
from energy from what is currently Tropical Storm Agatha over
Mexico. At this time, a low track northeastward near or over the
Florida Peninsula is possible, but with fairly low confidence in
the track, timing, and strength of a tropical system. Regardless,
heavy rain is possible late week into the weekend with moisture
streaming ahead of this potential system and then near its
possible eventual track.


...Model Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Recent model guidance is in reasonably good agreement for the
overall synoptic pattern late this week. An upper low spinning
offshore of British Columbia shows good consensus with its
position and a slow drift northward through the weekend, with
general troughing for the U.S. West Coast shown by all the
guidance. There are some differences arising by Monday of next
week though--GFS runs have been persistent in indicating shortwave
troughing tracking into the north-central U.S. whereas the
ECMWF/CMC runs hold the energy back across the Northwest, yielding
ridging in the Rockies to High Plains. Preferred the latter at
this time given the GFS can have a bias for faster systems
sometimes, but there is quite a bit of spread from the ensemble
members, lowering confidence. Meanwhile the south-central Canada
upper low is forecast to persist but be slowly weakening and
possibly elongating at times. While on the large scale this seems
in good agreement, shortwave troughing stemming from that feature
could push a series of fronts across central and eastern parts of
the U.S. and provide foci for rain/convection, and these details
are more variable among guidance. But with the reasonable large
scale agreement, the WPC forecast utilized a blend of the 18Z GFS
and the 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC for the early part of the
forecast period, incorporating some GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period and reducing the deterministic GFS component.

Notable model differences continue to be seen with the potential
for a tropical system to develop in the southeastern
Gulf/northwestern Caribbean. The general trend over the past day
or so has been for a faster track of a tropical low ejecting
northeastward out of the large, complex area of low pressure over
the Bay of Campeche/Yucatan/northwestern Caribbean. The
deterministic GFS and CMC runs have always been faster than the
ECMWF runs, with considerable timing spread in ensemble members.
But each ECMWF run through the most recent 00Z run has shown a
faster trend, and model guidance indicates a system could reach
Florida by Saturday if it develops, then track into the western
Atlantic. Timing and track differences are also related to the
strength of the possible system. The ECMWF shows a stronger low
with more consolidated energy than the CMC and GFS, with a track
farther north across central Florida rather than southern Florida
or the Florida Straits like other guidance including the GFS/CMC
and many GEFS ensemble members. Overall there is ample uncertainty
with the possible development of a tropical cyclone and its
strength, track, and timing. See NHC tropical weather outlooks for
more on this system's potential for development and stay up to
date with the latest forecasts.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Tropical Storm Agatha has currently moved into Mexico and will
weaken quickly over unfavorable terrain there. But its associated
deep tropical moisture will stream into southern Florida Friday,
increasing the likelihood of rain and thunderstorms becoming more
frequent and widespread, first ahead of the remnant disturbance
and then with the potential for a tropical low to develop
(possibly partially from Agatha's remnants) and track over or near
the state. Moisture aloft from the far eastern Pacific and lower
level moisture from the Caribbean should lead to heavy rainfall,
even if the system's timing is in question. Even in the cyclone's
wake, its convergent tail appears to be stuck in the vicinity of
South Florida and the Keys, keeping the threat of moderate to
heavy rainfall in play into early next week. Slight Risks are in
place in WPC's experimental Days 4 and 5 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest
late week into the weekend given the trough axis near the West
Coast and onshore flow. However, the Southwest should remain dry
and hot, with Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high
temperatures this weekend into early next week. Farther east,
fronts are expected to spark rounds of showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern U.S., with the Carolinas an area of
focus on Friday and parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
seeing convection Friday into the weekend and early next week as
fronts meander there, with the usual uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Friday with rain cooled
air, but should switch to above normal in Texas by 10-15F by early
next week. Periodic troughing in the northern tier should lead to
slightly below average temperatures by around 10F. The western
U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F late in the workweek but
cooler temperatures are forecast by the weekend under the
troughing influence and as a cold front moves through the area.

faster trend, and model guidance indicates a system could reach
Florida by Saturday if it develops, then track into the western
Atlantic. Timing and track differences are also related to the
strength of the possible system. The ECMWF shows a stronger low
with more consolidated energy than the CMC and GFS, with a track
farther north across central Florida rather than southern Florida
or the Florida Straits like other guidance including the GFS/CMC
and many GEFS ensemble members. Overall there is ample uncertainty
with the possible development of a tropical cyclone and its
strength, track, and timing. See NHC tropical weather outlooks for
more on this system's potential for development and stay up to
date with the latest forecasts.


...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Tropical Storm Agatha has currently moved into Mexico and will
weaken quickly over unfavorable terrain there. But its associated
deep tropical moisture will stream into southern Florida Friday,
increasing the likelihood of rain and thunderstorms becoming more
frequent and widespread, first ahead of the remnant disturbance
and then with the potential for a tropical low to develop
(possibly partially from Agatha's remnants) and track over or near
the state. Moisture aloft from the far eastern Pacific and lower
level moisture from the Caribbean should lead to heavy rainfall,
even if the system's timing is in question. Even in the cyclone's
wake, its convergent tail appears to be stuck in the vicinity of
South Florida and the Keys, keeping the threat of moderate to
heavy rainfall in play into early next week. Slight Risks are in
place in WPC's experimental Days 4 and 5 Excessive Rainfall
Outlook.

Elsewhere, rain chances are expected to increase in the Northwest
late week into the weekend given the trough axis near the West
Coast and onshore flow. However, the Southwest should remain dry
and hot, with Death Valley expected to meet or exceed 110F high
temperatures this weekend into early next week. Farther east,
fronts are expected to spark rounds of showers and thunderstorms
across the central and eastern U.S., with the Carolinas an area of
focus on Friday and parts of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
seeing convection Friday into the weekend and early next week as
fronts meander there, with the usual uncertainties in placement.

A relatively flat pattern aloft compared to the more amplified
short range period should produce lesser temperature anomalies
late this week into early next week. Cooler than average spots
will be across the central/southern Plains Friday with rain cooled
air, but should switch to above normal in Texas by 10-15F by early
next week. Periodic troughing in the northern tier should lead to
slightly below average temperatures by around 10F. The western
U.S. could be warmer than normal by 5-10F late in the workweek but
cooler temperatures are forecast by the weekend under the
troughing influence and as a cold front moves through the area.

...A threat of severe weather exists today from the Great Lakes
down through the southern High Plains...

...Areas of heavy rainfall will impact portions of the central and
southern Plains, and the middle Mississippi Valley which may
result in localized areas of flash flooding...

...Much cooler temperatures to arrive across the Plains and
Midwest through the middle of the week...

...Heat and humidity across many areas of the East today will give
way to cooler temperatures and a threat of showers and
thunderstorms by later this week...

A strong area of low pressure will be exiting the Red River Valley
this morning and will lift through western Ontario by this
evening. This will allow the heavy rainfall and severe weather
threat to come to an end across the Upper Midwest with drier and
cooler temperatures arriving in its wake. An associated cold front
will be settling southeastward across the Great Lakes region by
this evening and will stretch southwestward back down into the
southern High Plains. Once again this front is expected to
interact with a very moist and unstable airmass along and ahead of
it which will set the stage for numerous areas of heavy showers
and thunderstorms. Some of the thunderstorms are expected to be
severe later today and tonight, and the Storm Prediction Center
has depicted an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms from the
Texas Panhandle northeastward across northwest Oklahoma and into
southeast Kansas. Large hail, damaging winds, and perhaps a couple
of tornadoes will be possible across these areas. Some
thunderstorms with large hail and damaging winds may also impact
the middle Mississippi Valley through the Great Lakes.

In addition to the severe weather, the showers and thunderstorms
will produce areas of heavy rainfall and there will be concerns
for areas of flash flooding across parts of the central and
southern Plains, and the middle Mississippi Valley. The Weather
Prediction Center has indicated a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall across portions of this region where the front will be
slowing down and allowing for the shower and thunderstorm activity
to persist and locally train over the same area for an extended
period of time. Locally a few inches of rain will be possible,
with the heaviest amounts likely focusing from northwest Oklahoma
through southeast Kansas and into western and central Missouri.

The front by Wednesday will be slowly drifting southward down
through the southern Plains and may occasionally stall out as it
approaches the Red River Valley of the South. Additional areas of
showers and thunderstorms are expected across the southern Plains
on Wednesday with locally heavy rainfall totals across parts of
southern Oklahoma and northern Texas. A few severe thunderstorms
with large hail and damaging winds will also be possible.

Aside from a threat of showers and thunderstorms across the Gulf
Coast, and especially down across areas of southeast Florida, much
of the East will see a dry, hot, and humid day ahead as high
pressure offshore of the East Coast maintains southerly flow up
from the Gulf of Mexico. This will yield widespread above normal
temperatures with many areas seeing temperatures ranging from the
upper 80s to the mid 90s. However, much cooler temperatures by
comparison will be noted over New England over the next couple of
days as a backdoor cold front sinks south from southeast Canada.
Some scattered showers will be possible along this front as well.
However, the front upstream across the Plains and Midwest will
arrive across the East on Wednesday and Thursday which will break
down the heat more regionally and also bring a more widespread
threat of showers and thunderstorms.

Elsewhere, the very cool temperatures that are currently situated
over the Intermountain West will settle south and east down
through the central and southern Plains, and also the southern
Rockies in behind the aforementioned front. Temperatures will be
locally well below normal over the next couple of days, but this
will be welcome news as this will help to lower the fire danger
across the region, and mitigate the spread of any ongoing fires.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1045 AM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

The previous forecast remains on track with no changes required.
Morning surface observations show elevated to locally critical
conditions ongoing with RH values in the teens and wind gusts
between 20-35 mph. Weak surface pressure falls are noted across
northern CA and southern OR, indicative of the influence of the
approach upper wave that will result in a cessation of the offshore
wind regime later this afternoon/tonight. Until then, elevated
conditions remain likely and will be most prevalent across northern
Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Forecast concerns regarding
north-central MT outlined in the previous discussion below remain
valid.

..Moore.. 10/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1245 AM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will continue to move eastward through the West
and into the Plains today. By the end of the period, cyclonic flow
aloft will return to the West Coast. At the surface, a broad
anticyclone will be situated within the Great Basin into the
southern Plains. The strength of the surface high will peak early in
the period.

...Southern California...
Elevated to briefly critical fire weather conditions are again
expected across much of the Transverse and Peninsular Ranges. A
similar offshore gradient, though most likely weaker, to Friday
morning can be expected this morning. The pressure gradient will
relax by the afternoon. Current surface observations in the region
continue to show widespread RH below 20% and most locations will not
significantly recover by morning. Winds of 15-20 mph will be most
prevalent with the typical wind-prone locations seeing higher
speeds. Those terrain-favored areas are also where critical
conditions may occur briefly during the early to mid morning.

...North-Central Montana...
Locally elevated conditions may occur in the lee of the Lewis Range
as a weak surface trough develops along with modest flow enhancement
aloft. Confidence in winds reaching 15-20 mph is relatively high,
but RH may remain above critical thresholds. A small area of
remaining dry fuels exists and could support fire growth should RH
fall to 20-25%.

The previous forecast remains on track. Sustained winds between
15-25 mph appear likely Sunday afternoon from central southern CA
northward into western and northwestern portions of the Great Basin.
Outside of a few locations in south-central CA, fuels remain too
unreceptive for a robust fire weather threat per recent analyses.
Forecast concerns regarding north-central Montana and the southern
High Plains remain valid as outlined in the previous discussion
below.

..Moore.. 10/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1246 AM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will shift into the central U.S. on Sunday. An
upper-level trough will move into the Pacific Northwest and northern
California by the end of the period. At the surface, flow across the
southern Plains will return to southerly along the western flank of
surface high. A cyclone will develop within the lee of the Canadian
Rockies and increase winds ahead of it and its attendant cold front
extending into the western Great Basin.

Dry and windy conditions are probable within western/central Nevada
and perhaps into southeastern Oregon. Fuels are not currently
critically dry across those areas. Some potential for locally
elevated conditions will again exist in north-central Montana. RH is
expected to be lower than on Saturday, but the surface pressure
gradient will also be weaker. Finally, dry southerly winds from a
continental airmass may support a marginal increase in fire danger
in parts of the southern High Plains. With confidence in winds above
15 mph remaining low as well as much of the area receiving recent
rainfall, highlights will be withheld here also.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
249 PM EDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021 - 12Z Sat Oct 23 2021

...Overview...

Fairly progressive upper-level flow is expected for the initial
part of the medium range period, with a closed upper low initially
over the Rockies/High Plains that will eject eastward over the
northern Plains and Upper Midwest by the middle of the week, while
pushing a cold front ahead that should reach the East Coast by the
end of the week. Meanwhile, mean troughing over the eastern
Pacific is likely to have several shortwaves rotating around it,
which should lead to a couple of cold frontal passages and rounds
of precipitation along the West Coast, while an amplifying upper
ridge over the Intermountain West will tend to limit the eastward
progression of these weather systems.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance remains in good agreement with the overall synoptic
scale pattern through Wednesday with the aforementioned closed low
tracking across the central U.S., as well as troughing across the
eastern Pacific and a closed low centered over the Canadian
Maritimes. However from Wednesday onward, complex northern stream
flow across Canada has shown several differences between models
and from run to run. While guidance is now more agreeable in the
00Z/06Z cycle for a closed low over east-central Canada by
Thursday, its positioning shows differences--the UKMET and EC are
southwest of the GFS runs and south of the CMC. These
discrepancies remain on Friday, as the CMC retrogrades while GFS
runs lift the core of the upper low northeastward. This feature
affects the track of the closed low as it shrinks and its timing
of joining up with the northern stream flow (GFS runs are slower
with the southern shortwave/low and maintain separation longer,
but the new 12Z GFS may be trending a bit more towards consensus
of the other guidance). These discrepancies lead to lower forecast
confidence across the Northeast U.S. by later in the forecast
period.

Across the eastern Pacific into the western U.S., the large-scale
trough pattern is shown by all deterministic and ensemble
guidance, though with typical differences in shortwave timing and
magnitude. However, timing of a shortwave entering the Pacific
Northwest early Wednesday is becoming more agreeable. By the
latter part of the week, the 00Z CMC remains somewhat of a weaker
amplitude outlier compared to the GFS runs, with the 00Z ECMWF
sort of a middle ground solution. Details with this are quite
uncertain especially since this troughing/energy tracks from
data-poor regions of the Arctic/Russia/northern Pacific.

For today's WPC mass fields, a multi-model deterministic blend of
the 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET, and CMC was utilized for the
beginning of the medium range period. Then for the latter part of
the period, transitioned toward using a higher proportion of
ensemble means, particularly the EC mean given it gave better
definition to the Canadian upper low that deterministic guidance
has been trending towards. Overall this maintained good continuity
with the previous forecast.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The developing storm system over the Plains and Midwest is
expected to produce snow across higher elevations of the
north-central Rockies and into the Black Hills, with some
possibility of light snow over the northern High Plains as well,
or a chilly rain. Rain should then spread across the Midwest and
Great Lakes along the track of the surface low, while light rain
showers are also expected along the cold front as it moves
eastward from the Plains to the Eastern Seaboard. Across the West
Coast region, multiple rounds of showers are expected from
northern California to western Washington, and some of these will
likely be moderate to heavy at times with moist onshore flow ahead
of multiple Pacific storm systems. Some locations may get on the
order of 2 to 4 inches of rain over the entire forecast period,
particularly across windward terrain.

In terms of temperatures, it will likely feel more like early-mid
November across much of the Intermountain West and the
central/northern Rockies in the wake of the departing storm system
on Tuesday, with high temperatures running about 10 to 20 degrees
below average. There should be a gradual moderation in
temperatures going through the middle to end of the week as an
upper-level ridge begins to build in, and then readings up to 10
degrees above average for some of these same areas by next
Saturday. Generally cooler than normal temperatures are forecast
for the West Coast, influenced by the upper trough. Ahead of the
cold front, it will likely feel more like late September across
the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley with highs on the order of 5-15
degrees above average for the middle of the week, although not to
the levels observed over this past week and not as humid.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat October 16 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
334 PM EDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 00Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Severe weather in the Northeast tonight...

...Seasonal temperatures return to eastern third of the country;
cooldown in the West while northern/central U.S. warms-up through
Monday...

...Elevated fire weather conditions continue in Southern
California; snow returns to the Sierra...

A cold front, which has been the focus for precipitation east of
the Mississippi Valley over the past couple of days, will continue
to produce rainfall for much of the Northeast this evening before
moving offshore tomorrow. Flooding concerns are expected to be
marginal across the Northeast, a shift to northwesterly winds in
the wake of the cold front will lead to an extended period of
rainfall, ending Sunday evening, downwind of the Lower Great Lakes
region due to lake effect enhancement. Scattered to isolated
thunderstorms are also possible for this area. Isolated severe
thunderstorms are possible for parts of the Northeast this evening
as indicated by a Slight Risk area issued by the Storm Prediction
Center. A return to Fall-like temperatures is in store for the
East coast over the next few days after a brief warm spell.

Meanwhile, upper-level ridging across the central U.S. will spread
eastward over the next few days and eventually settle over the
Southeast by Monday leading to sunny and seasonal conditions for
the region. An amplified upper-level trough will eject a surface
low pressure system over the Pacific Northwest tonight. This
system will go on to produce lower elevation rainfall along the
Northwest coast as well as inland areas while generating snowfall
across much of the Sierra and parts of the intermountain West
through Monday. Temperatures will rise across the Northern/Central
Plains and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley out ahead of this
system. High temperatures may reach 10-20 degrees above average in
some places. High pressure is expected to build across the Pacific
Northwest on Monday which will lead to a cool-down for much of the
Western U.S. over the following days. An Elevated Fire risk area
is in effect for Southern California tonight as dry and windy
conditions continue to pose a the threat to the region.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 PM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will move into the Plains today. Across the
West, an upper-level trough will pivot into the Pacific Northwest
and northern California. At the surface, southerly winds will return
the southern High Plains on the western flank of a surface high
pressure system. A cold front will progress into northern California
and western/central parts of the Great Basin by the end of the
period.

Strong winds along with areas of lowered RH are possible ahead of
the front in the Great Basin. Fuels are too moist for fire weather
concerns. Across parts of north-central Montana, surface winds will
increase ahead of the cold front as well. Guidance continues to vary
on the degree of drying that will occur. Even with areas of 20-25%
RH, winds generally will stay below 15 mph except within areas of
terrain enhancement. Locally elevated conditions are most probable
in the lee of the Lewis Range where some fuels remain dry. Lastly,
modestly dry and windy conditions are expected in the southern High
Plains. Winds continue to appear relatively light (below 15 mph)
along with fuels not being particularly dry.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1151 PM CDT Sat Oct 16 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough in the West will continue eastward and begin
become less of an open wave with time. As this feature approaches
the Four Corners, lee cyclogenesis is expected to occur late in the
period across eastern Colorado. Southerly flow will increase across
a broad area of the Plains.

...Southern/central High Plains...
The greatest fire weather concerns will be focused within this
region on Monday. Southerly return flow will be ongoing from late
Sunday onward. With some moisture advecting northward, along with
mid/upper-level clouds possible in some areas, it is unclear how
long elevated to near-critical fire weather conditions will overlap.
Consequently, most guidance suggests only brief periods of concern
with the exception of the typically drier HRRR solutions. The
longest duration of 15-20% RH and 15-20 mph winds will most likely
occur in northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado and parts of
western Kansas. Aside from concerns about duration, fuels remain
marginally dry. While some grasses could potentially carry fire by
Monday, concerns remain too localized for highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Sun Oct 17 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Oct 20 2021 - 12Z Sun Oct 24 2021

...Overview...

A fairly typical late October weather pattern is expected to be in
place across the majority of the nation during the medium range
forecast period.  A surface low and trailing cold front will track
from the Midwest to the Northeast, with the front exiting the East
Coast by the end of the week.  A rather active pattern will be in
place across the eastern Pacific with a persistent upper level
trough off the West Coast that will support several shortwaves
rotating around it along with a couple of cold frontal passages
and rounds of precipitation.  Meanwhile, a ridge axis is expected
to briefly build over the Intermountain West and then be
positioned over the Plains by next weekend.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in good agreement with the
overall synoptic scale pattern through about Thursday, and the
operational guidance agrees that the upper low tracking across the
Plains and Midwest will likely become absorbed by northern stream
flow over the Great Lakes region.  Model differences remain across
Ontario and Quebec with a closed low dropping south, with the 00Z
CMC appearing to be a slower and slightly weaker solution, and the
past few runs of the GFS remaining more progressive.  Out West,
the models remain in decent agreement on the overall large scale
trough, with the typical differences in shortwave timing and
magnitude, with the GFS more amplified with the shortwave reaching
California Friday night.  The WPC fronts and pressures were
primarily derived from a multi-deterministic blend through
Thursday, and then increasing contributions from the ensemble
means by next weekend owing to increasing model spread and less
weighting to the GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Across the West Coast region, multiple rounds of showers are
expected from northern California to western Washington, and some
of these will likely be moderate to heavy at times with moist
onshore flow ahead of multiple Pacific storm systems. Some
locations may get on the order of 2 to 5 inches of rain over the
entire forecast period, particularly across windward terrain.
Snow is possible for the highest mountains of the Cascades and
Sierra Nevada, mainly above pass level.  There is some signal in
the model guidance for an atmospheric river event next weekend
ahead of an energetic Pacific storm system across the coastal
ranges of northern California and southwest Oregon, with rainfall
reaching as far south as the greater San Francisco metro area.
Strong winds are also possible near the coast. Across the eastern
U.S., a broken swath of showers and perhaps some thunderstorms can
be expected ahead of the advancing cold front, but the relative
dearth of deep moisture ahead of it will serve to limit the heavy
rainfall potential.

In terms of temperatures, it will likely feel more like mid
November across much of the Northern Plains in the wake of the
departing storm system on Wednesday, with high temperatures
running about 10 to 15 degrees below average.  There should be a
gradual moderation in temperatures going through the end of the
week and into the weekend as an upper-level ridge begins to build
in, and then readings up to 10 degrees above average for the
western High Plains by next Sunday.  Generally cooler than normal
temperatures are forecast for the West Coast, influenced by the
upper trough and mainly overcast skies.  Ahead of the cold front,
it will likely feel more like late September from the Great Lakes
and Ohio Valley to the East Coast with highs on the order of 5-10
degrees above average for the middle of the week, although
humidity levels should remain in check.

Valid 12Z Sun Oct 17 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Seasonally cool temperatures along the Coasts and the Deep
South; warming up from the Northern Rockies to the Midwest...

...Upper trough to cause accumulating mountain snowfall and lower
elevation rainfall from the Pacific Northwest to the Intermountain
West; lake effect showers in the eastern Great Lakes; showers and
storms possible in South Florida...

After a remarkably warm first half of October along and east of
the Mississippi River, autumn has finally made its long awaited
appearance across the South and along the East Coast. Temperature
departures both today and Monday look to range anywhere from 5 to
15 degrees below normal along the East Coast and as far south as
South Texas. Meanwhile, after a chilly few days in the central
High Plains and Midwest, temperatures rebound to abnormally warm
levels in these regions. Daytime highs in these areas will soar
into the 70s with some 80s sprinkled in over the central and
southern High Plains. Farther west, the West Coast joins the East
Coast in witnessing much cooler temperatures than their neighbors
in the Heartland. As an upper trough tracks into the Intermountain
West on Monday, daily max temperature departures are forecast to
range between 10 and 20 degrees below normal from the central
Great Basin to the California coast.

Precipitation-wise, while much of the country will be dry thanks
to an expansive area of high pressure, there are still a few areas
likely to contend with wet and even snowy weather. An amplifying
upper trough taking aim at the West Coast will direct Pacific
moisture at the Pacific Northwest today. This will lead to valley
and coastal showers from northern California to western
Washington. Meanwhile, precipitation will fall in the form of snow
in the higher elevations of the northern Sierra Nevada and Oregon
Cascades. Most totals will only range between 2-6 inches, but the
tallest peaks could pick up as much as a foot of snow. As the
upper trough becomes a closed upper low on Monday, the threat for
snow moves east into the Intermountain West with the Tetons, Wind
River, and Absaroka Ranges having the best chances of picking up
6-12 inches of snowfall. Elsewhere, lake effect rain showers are
set to develop down wind of the Lakes Ontario and Erie. As the
pressure gradient weakens throughout the Great Lakes, bands of
lake effect showers will dissipate sometime Monday. Lastly, the
cold front that ushered in much cooler conditions into the East
will potentially trigger spotty showers and thunderstorms in South
Florida later today.

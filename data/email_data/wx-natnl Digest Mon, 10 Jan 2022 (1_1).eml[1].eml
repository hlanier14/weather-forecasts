Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1008 AM CST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track, with no changes or additions
made. Please see the previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 01/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sun Jan 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
A mid/upper-level ridge will amplify over the Intermountain West,
with cool surface high pressure overspreading much of the western
and central United States.

...Southern Plains...
A modest pressure gradient along the southern periphery of the
surface high will support 15-25 mph northerly surface winds across
the southern Plains. However, relatively cool temperatures should
limit substantial RH reductions across the region. The best overlap
of breezy northerly winds and modestly low RH (20-25 percent) should
develop over parts of the southern TX Panhandle into the TX South
Plains, where a few hours of locally elevated fire-weather
conditions will be possible during the afternoon.

...Southern California...
Breezy/gusty offshore flow will develop across portions of southern
California in response to the building high pressure over the
Intermountain West. With that said, RH should generally remain above
25 percent. Upon collaboration with the local forecast offices,
fuels are expected to remain unsupportive of wildfire spread owing
to the substantial rainfall and cool temperatures through much of
December.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 12 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 16 2022

...Overview...

General ridging over the western U.S. is expected to continue into
the medium-range period as shortwaves dive across the central
Canada into the northern tier while a lingering low/trough off
Baja California is forecast to eventually track into the southern
Plains.  This split flow pattern could potentially phase near the
East Coast where cyclogenesis would be possible by next weekend.
Model ensemble means favor this phasing scenario in contrast with
the deterministic solutions which continue to indicate a split
decision in this regard.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, the ensemble means have maintained relatively good
run-to-run consistency in predicting the pattern evolution across
the U.S. through the medium-range period.  The largest discrepancy
was noted with regard to how the upper low/trough off Baja
California is handled.  The ECMWF switched to a much slower
solution in the 00Z run in the short-range, thus keeping this
feature well off the coast into the medium-range.  The GFS trended
toward this slow solution as well starting with the 06Z run.  This
sudden slow down of the upper low has resulted in a marked
lowering of rain chances over the southern Plains midweek.  The
ensemble means indicate that this upper low/trough will eventually
lift toward the Southwest late next week as the next shortwave
dives across the Canadian prairies toward the northern Plains.
Models then begin to diverge as to whether these two features will
eventually phase or remain split as they reach the vicinity of the
East Coast by next weekend.  It appears that the ensemble means
support the phasing scenario in contrast with the deterministic
solutions which continue to indicate a split decision in this
regard.  The ECMWF and CMC have been in favor of phasing and
cyclogenesis near the East Coast whereas the GFS supports a more
separation between the two streams with its typically faster
solution.

Prior to the weekend, models and ensembles are in good agreement
for a deep trough to exit the East Coast Thu-Fri with a strong
signal for cyclogenesis off the East Coast.  It appears that the
heavy rain would stay off shore with what appears to be a deep
cyclone in the making.

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to heavy precipitation could continue on Wednesday in the
favored higher elevations of the Olympics and northern Cascades,
though the heaviest precipitation is forecast over Vancouver
Island as a weak atmospheric river takes aim at the region.
Meanwhile, the southern stream Pacific upper low influencing the
Southwest will spread precipitation to the Four Corners states and
then into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by
Thursday and Friday as it tracks inland and a low pressure/frontal
system develops. Shortwaves moving through the northern stream
could spread light lake effect/enhanced snow to the Great Lakes
around midweek, but chances for wintry weather could ramp up by
the latter part of the week for the Midwest/Great Lakes underneath
the stronger shortwave energy dropping through the region. As the
split flow appears to phase by next weekend, precipitation should
spread to the Eastern Seaboard, with rain in the South and the
possibility for snow in the Northeast, but with uncertainty in the
details at this time.

After a chilly day in the Eastern Seaboard on Wednesday,
especially in the Northeast where lows will be 10-20F below
average, temperatures should moderate closer to normal or a bit
above there by the latter part of the week. The central U.S. will
see considerably warmer than normal conditions, with a widespread
area in the Plains/Mississippi Valley seeing highs 10-20F above
average, even warmer in localized areas. Meanwhile, lows will be
15-25F above normal in the Northern Plains. Then by next weekend,
as cooler high pressure systems build in behind cold fronts, highs
should be right around average for this time of year in most
places, with pockets that are a few degrees cooler than normal for
highs, while lows should be a few degrees milder than normal in
the East.

Valid 12Z Wed Jan 12 2022 - 12Z Sun Jan 16 2022

...Overview...

General ridging over the western U.S. is expected to continue into
the medium-range period as shortwaves dive across the central
Canada into the northern tier while a lingering low/trough off
Baja California is forecast to eventually track into the southern
Plains.  This split flow pattern could potentially phase near the
East Coast where cyclogenesis would be possible by next weekend.
Model ensemble means favor this phasing scenario in contrast with
the deterministic solutions which continue to indicate a split
decision in this regard.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Overall, the ensemble means have maintained relatively good
run-to-run consistency in predicting the pattern evolution across
the U.S. through the medium-range period.  The largest discrepancy
was noted with regard to how the upper low/trough off Baja
California is handled.  The ECMWF switched to a much slower
solution in the 00Z run in the short-range, thus keeping this
feature well off the coast into the medium-range.  The GFS trended
toward this slow solution as well starting with the 06Z run.  This
sudden slow down of the upper low has resulted in a marked
lowering of rain chances over the southern Plains midweek.  The
ensemble means indicate that this upper low/trough will eventually
lift toward the Southwest late next week as the next shortwave
dives across the Canadian prairies toward the northern Plains.
Models then begin to diverge as to whether these two features will
eventually phase or remain split as they reach the vicinity of the
East Coast by next weekend.  It appears that the ensemble means
support the phasing scenario in contrast with the deterministic
solutions which continue to indicate a split decision in this
regard.  The ECMWF and CMC have been in favor of phasing and
cyclogenesis near the East Coast whereas the GFS supports a more
separation between the two streams with its typically faster
solution.

Prior to the weekend, models and ensembles are in good agreement
for a deep trough to exit the East Coast Thu-Fri with a strong
signal for cyclogenesis off the East Coast.  It appears that the
heavy rain would stay off shore with what appears to be a deep
cyclone in the making.

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to heavy precipitation could continue on Wednesday in the
favored higher elevations of the Olympics and northern Cascades,
though the heaviest precipitation is forecast over Vancouver
Island as a weak atmospheric river takes aim at the region.
Meanwhile, the southern stream Pacific upper low influencing the
Southwest will spread precipitation to the Four Corners states and
then into the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by
Thursday and Friday as it tracks inland and a low pressure/frontal
system develops. Shortwaves moving through the northern stream
could spread light lake effect/enhanced snow to the Great Lakes
around midweek, but chances for wintry weather could ramp up by
the latter part of the week for the Midwest/Great Lakes underneath
the stronger shortwave energy dropping through the region. As the
split flow appears to phase by next weekend, precipitation should
spread to the Eastern Seaboard, with rain in the South and the
possibility for snow in the Northeast, but with uncertainty in the
details at this time.

After a chilly day in the Eastern Seaboard on Wednesday,
especially in the Northeast where lows will be 10-20F below
average, temperatures should moderate closer to normal or a bit
above there by the latter part of the week. The central U.S. will
see considerably warmer than normal conditions, with a widespread
area in the Plains/Mississippi Valley seeing highs 10-20F above
average, even warmer in localized areas. Meanwhile, lows will be
15-25F above normal in the Northern Plains. Then by next weekend,
as cooler high pressure systems build in behind cold fronts, highs
should be right around average for this time of year in most
places, with pockets that are a few degrees cooler than normal for
highs, while lows should be a few degrees milder than normal in
the East.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 PM CST Sun Jan 09 2022

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Dry conditions (i.e. Elevated-criteria surface RH) are expected to
develop across portions of the southern High Plains by afternoon
peak heating tomorrow, though the lack of stronger surface winds
will limit significant wildfire-spread potential. In all, the
previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Squitieri.. 01/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sun Jan 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will persist across the Intermountain
West, with surface high pressure encompassing much of the western
and central CONUS. Along the northern portion of the upper-ridge, a
belt of enhanced northwesterly midlevel flow will favor surface
troughing in the lee of the northern and central Rockies.

...Northern and Central High Plains...
In response to the surface lee troughing, breezy west-southwesterly
surface winds will be possible across parts of the northern and
central High Plains. Presently, RH appears to remain above critical
thresholds and fuels look unreceptive to wildfire spread.

...Southern California...
Breezy/gusty offshore flow will continue across parts of southern
California, though RH should generally remain above 25 percent. In
addition, fuels are expected to remain unsupportive of a substantial
fire-weather threat.

...Please see

with cyclogenesis off the East Coast together with a tendency to

A multi-model/ensemble blend was used to compose this morning's
WPC medium-range forecasts.  The 06Z GFS was taken out of the
blend beyond Day 5 as it appears to build too much high pressure
across the Great Lakes, thereby making the northern stream low too
weak.  The 00Z GFS was not used as a substitute either because it
tracks the low too fast to the east.  The rest of the blend
consists of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, the 06Z GEFS, and the 00Z
CMC/CMC mean through Day 7.

...Weather Highlights...

Moderate to heavy precipitation continuing into Wednesday across
the Olympic Peninsula and northern Cascades should begin to wind
down as the associated low pressure system is forecast to weaken.
Meanwhile, the southern stream Pacific upper low is forecast to
spread precipitation into the Four Corners states into late this
week but the chance of rain across the southern Plains and lower
Mississippi Valley has decreased considerably on Wed-Thu.  Gulf
moisture is expected to return along the western Gulf Coast region
by Friday and into the weekend.  Meanwhile, as the northern stream
shortwave and surface low track across the northern tier late
week, a swath of wintry precipitation can be expected to spread
from west to east from the upper Midwest through the Great Lakes
and eventually into New England.  Thereafter, we will need to
monitor how much the split flow pattern will phase near the East
Coast this weekend to determine the extent and types of weather
impacts the system may bring to the Eastern Seaboard.

Temperature-wise, after a cold start to the day along the East
Coast on Wednesday, temperatures will rebound closer to near or
above normal by Thursday.  The central U.S. will see very mild and
dry conditions through midweek, with a widespread high
temperatures reaching 10-20F above average. Meanwhile, lows will
be 15-25F above normal in the Northern Plains.  Cooler air will
then overspread the Plains as the split flow pattern migrates
toward the East Coast where the potential for cyclogenesis exists
by next weekend.

...Heavy lake effect snow for areas downwind from Lake Ontario
into Tuesday...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Lower Mississippi Valley, Central Gulf Coast, and parts of the
Southeast through Monday morning...

...There is a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Southern
Appalachians, and Southern Ohio Valley through Monday morning...

...Rain/freezing rain for parts of the Pacific Northwest east of
the Cascades through Tuesday evening...

A front extending from the Northeast to the Central Gulf Coast
will move off the East Coast and the Gulf Coast by Monday morning.
Showers and thunderstorms will develop along and ahead of the
front over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley, Central Gulf
Coast, and the Southeast through early Monday morning. The
dynamics of these thunderstorms have led the SPC to issue a Slight
Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Lower Mississippi
Valley, Central Gulf Coast, and parts of the Southeast through
Monday morning. The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes.

In addition, areas of heavy rain will also accompany these
thunderstorms. Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley,
Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, and Southern Ohio Valley
through Monday morning. The associated heavy rain will create
localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience
rapid runoff with heavy rain.

Meanwhile, areas of light snow will develop over parts of the
Northeast, and along the rain/snow line, areas of rain/freezing
rain will develop over parts of the Northeast through Sunday
evening. Residents in the regions mentioned above are urged to
double-check road conditions and the current forecast before
traveling, as ice-covered roads require longer stopping distances.
Most of the rain and snow will end over the Northeast on Monday.
However, cold air will move over the Upper Midwest, Great Lakes,
and the Northeast in the wake of the cold front. The cold air
moving over Lakes Superior and Huron then over Lake Ontario will
produce heavy lake effect snow for areas downwind from Lake
Ontario from Monday into Tuesday afternoon. Showers and
thunderstorms will continue over Florida through Tuesday afternoon.

In the meantime, upper-level ridging will develop over parts of
the Northwest. In addition, a warm front will move onshore over
the Northwest on Monday. As a result, rain will develop over parts
of the Pacific Northwest Coast. As the moisture moves farther
inland, some snow will develop over the highest elevations of the
Northern Cascades. East of the Cascades, cold air will be trapped
in the valleys allowing rain/freezing rain to develop over the
region through Tuesday evening. Residents in the area are urged to
double-check road conditions and the current forecast before
traveling, as ice-covered roads require longer stopping distances.

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Overview...

A complex split flow pattern will occur during the medium range
period, with progressive shortwaves diving through the
north-central and eastern U.S. while southern stream energy
initially lingers well offshore Baja California before additional
Pacific energy drops into the West and disrupts mean ridging
there. At the surface, a Miller-A type cyclone could develop this
weekend and move from the Southeast into the western Atlantic, but
with quite a bit of uncertainty with its track and thus the
impacts along the Eastern Seaboard.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Given the complexity of the pattern, confidence is somewhat low
for the details of the medium range forecast. However, there are
some general commonalities among recent models. The initial
southern stream energy/troughing well west of Baja California on
Thursday continues to trend toward mainly weakening off the coast
before tracking over the Southwest more slowly as it joins up with
additional energy dropping south through the West, as opposed to a
faster closed low moving eastward that most guidance showed about
a day ago. The UKMET was first to show this type of solution that
guidance has now trended toward. There are still some
uncertainties with the magnitude of the upstream energy dropping
southward from the Pacific and the interaction with the initial
southern stream energy and the existing mean ridge across the West
on Friday, but the large variations in ensemble member 500mb
heights for example make it difficult to determine outliers at
this time.

Meanwhile in the East, a trough axis has good agreement early in
the period Thursday but differences in shortwave energy tracking
through the mean trough lead the 00Z GFS to close off a mid-upper
low by Friday in the western Atlantic, which is not favored by
other guidance. Regardless, the trough could dig somewhat, and
guidance shows an associated surface low deepening considerably in
the western Atlantic on Friday into Saturday, but mainly far
enough offshore of the U.S. not to cause much precipitation over
the Eastern Seaboard--though, winds could be a concern with a
tightening pressure gradient near the New England coast.

Then by the weekend, energy diving southeastward into the
north-central U.S. will deepen a possibly positively-tilted (at
least on Saturday) trough that tracks into the eastern U.S. on
Sunday. This trough also may be supported by the western energy,
but there remains some disagreement with their interaction, and
most guidance seems to leave energy behind in the Southwest and
form and maintain a closed low there over the weekend, with the
12Z ECMWF the main exception as a second northern stream shortwave
crossing into the north-central U.S. could dominate and phase with
the southern stream energy. With phasing and shortwave intensity
differences, predictability remains low and this affects the
surface pattern as well. Deterministic guidance for the
12/18Z/incoming 00Z cycle varied quite a bit with their low tracks
over the central/eastern U.S. and western Atlantic.

For the WPC medium range fronts/pressures forecast, a blend of the
18Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, CMC, and UKMET worked for the beginning of
the period, with fairly even weighting given the uncertainty in
any particular outliers, and transitioned toward utilizing more of
the ensemble means as the period progressed.

...Weather Highlights...

Some light precipitation is likely for parts of the Southwest and
into the Four Corners states for the latter part of the week given
the upper low's influence, while precipitation chances continue to
decrease across the south-central U.S. given model trends. Then as
the northern stream shortwave and surface low track across the
northern tier late week, a swath of wintry precipitation is
currently expected to spread from west to east from the upper
Midwest through the Great Lakes and eventually into New England.
Areas farther south such as the Ohio Valley, much of the
Appalachians, and the Mid-Atlantic could also see winter weather,
but dependent on the low track and the potential for the split
flow pattern to phase in the upper levels, which are quite
uncertain at this point. Meanwhile, the south-central and
southeastern U.S. should see light to moderate rain along the
southern extent of the cold front on Saturday.

Temperature-wise, the central U.S. will see very mild and dry
conditions on Thursday and into Friday, with widespread high
temperatures reaching 10-25F above average. Meanwhile, lows will
be 15-25F above normal in the Northern Plains. Temperatures should
moderate somewhat by the weekend there, while colder than average
temperatures are forecast for the Northeast on Friday into the
weekend.

...Dangerous cold located from the Upper Midwest to the Northeast,
with heavy lake effect snow likely downwind of the Great Lakes...

...Heavy rain to return to portions of western Washington over the
next few days...

Behind a potent cold front that has exited into the eastern
Atlantic Ocean, arctic air is expected to continue rushing into
the Northeast this morning. This pocket of cold air extends
westward and throughout much of the northern tier, where
dangerously cold wind chills will remain across the Upper Midwest
and Great Lakes today before more bearable temperatures enter on
Tuesday. With wind chills expected to drop well below zero (as low
as minus 40 in spots), Wind Chill Warnings and Wind Chill
Advisories currently span twelve states throughout the northern
tier from far northeast Montana to northern Maine. Temperatures
this cold can lead to frostbite on exposed skin in as little as
ten minutes. For much of the Northeast and New England, these
frigid temperatures will remain locked over the region into
Wednesday morning as a strong high pressure system slowly swings
over the eastern United States. Meanwhile, in association with
cold west-northwesterly winds, lake effect snow is likely downwind
of the Great Lakes over the next few days. Snow could be
particularly heavy at times under very narrow snowbands throughout
the eastern U.P. of Michigan, the Tug Hill Plateau of New York
State, as well as far western New York and northwest Pennsylvania.
The heaviest snow is expected across the Tug Hill, where over a
foot of snow is possible. Winter Storm Warnings, Lake Effect Snow
Warnings, and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect.

For the Pacific Northwest, active weather is forecast to return to
parts of Washington after a brief lull in precipitation this past
weekend. Shower activity is expected to swing into western
Washington today ahead of an approaching frontal system located
over the eastern Pacific. Periods of heavier rain will then enter
the region on Tuesday, which could spawn flooding concerns. A
Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall has been issued for Tuesday
across the Olympic Peninsula, where several inches of rain falling
on saturated terrain could produce rapid runoff, river flooding,
and a risk of landslides. East of the Cascades, pockets of
freezing rain are possible on Tuesday throughout the Columbia
Basin.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms may impact
portions of the Florida Peninsula today as a cold front pushes
southward. With strong northeast winds found behind the front on
Tuesday, onshore flow could lead to additional showers across
southeast sections of the Sunshine State on Tuesday. For the
central U.S., dry weather will be easy to find as much of the
Lower 48 remains under the influence of high pressure. A warming
trend will also commence this week as highs soar above average
across the Great Plains on Tuesday and Wednesday.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A highly amplified midlevel ridge will persist over the
Intermountain West, with surface high pressure encompassing most of
the western and central United States. While RH will likely fall
into the 15-20 percent range across parts of the southern Great
Plains during the afternoon, generally light surface winds should
mitigate most fire-weather concerns.

0144 AM CST Mon Jan 10 2022

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Zonal midlevel flow will become established across the western and
central CONUS, with multiple shortwave impulses tracking through the
broad west-northwesterly flow. This pattern will favor lee troughing
over the Great Plains, with a corresponding increase in
southwesterly surface winds over the southern High Plains. While
locally elevated conditions may become possible over parts of the
TX/OK Panhandles into far western OK, confidence in a sufficient
spatial overlap of breezy surface winds and critically low RH
precludes highlights at this time.

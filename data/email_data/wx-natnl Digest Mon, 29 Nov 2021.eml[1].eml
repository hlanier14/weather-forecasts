Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1050 AM CST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 11/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0133 AM CST Sun Nov 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level ridge over the western United States is forecast
to gradually flatten through today as a mid-level shortwave
perturbation approaches the Pacific Northwest coast. Meanwhile, an
area of persistent surface high pressure will remain entrenched
across the Great Basin.

...Southern California...
A very dry air mass is forecast to remain over inland areas of
Southern California through today with poor overnight recoveries
(this morning and again tonight) and daytime minimum RH values under
5%. Periods of elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions
will be possible, especially in terrain-favored areas, as sustained
surface winds of 15-20 mph overlap critically-receptive fuels.

Locally critical fire weather conditions are most likely across
portions of the Ventura Valley into the San Gabriel Mountains and
across the Peninsular Range, where topographic enhancements to the
low-level flow is greatest.

...Eastern Wyoming/Montana and vicinity...
Strong westerly downslope flow is forecast to develop from midday
today through late this afternoon with sustained surface winds near
25-35 mph (much stronger gusts). While the presence of at least
modestly receptive fuels may promote a few hours of locally elevated
fire weather conditions, large-scale fire weather concerns are not
currently anticipated with forecast minimum RH values generally
exceeding of 30%.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 05 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada. This will include an organized
low pressure system tracking across southern Canada through Friday
with a trailing front followed by a weaker low this weekend,
leading to rounds of light to moderate precipitation across the
north-central and northeastern U.S. By the weekend, moist inflow
is expected to return to the south-central U.S., bringing
increased rain chances as the moisture focuses along a frontal
boundary.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00/06Z model cycle begins the medium range period Wednesday
with fairly good agreement with the large scale pattern: ridging
through western parts of the U.S. while shortwaves (with varying
intensities depending on the model) pass through mild troughing in
central/eastern parts of the country. A particularly strong
shortwave will push a surface low through southern Canada
Wednesday-Thursday with reasonably good agreement in position. GFS
runs were the strongest with a shortwave tracking quickly through
the Southeast late Wednesday into Thursday, which was not
particularly favored. Magnitude and positioning of shortwaves
continue to be the biggest forecast challenge Friday into the
weekend as well, causing some uncertainties to arise even within
the broader flow by the weekend. In general the flow by the
weekend has trended less amplified compared to model guidance,
with the exception of a southern stream upper low trending a
little stronger across northern Mexico by Sunday, and at this
point it does not appear there are clear outliers with the overall
pattern. Thus the WPC forecast was based initially on a blend of
deterministic guidance of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET,
and CMC, phasing toward a blend of the models and GEFS and EC
ensemble means by the end of the period, along with some
continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected. Generally moderate precipitation lingering in
the Pacific Northwest, particularly the Olympic Peninsula and
Northern Cascades, should abate for the latter part of the week as
a surface high builds over the Pacific Northwest and British
Columbia, before precipitation chances increase again for the
weekend. Rounds of relatively light precipitation are forecast for
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast with a progressive storm
track over the area. Amounts should be most substantial in favored
lake effect and possibly upslope areas, particularly downwind of
Lake Ontario into the Adirondacks. Then moisture is set to
increase across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
late Friday and into the weekend, which could lead to rain
becoming more widespread there and northeastward depending on
possible low pressure and frontal system development.

Temperatures are expected to be well above normal for this time of
year across the western U.S. and the Plains through the end of the
week owing to the ridge aloft, and closer to normal for the East
Coast on Wednesday followed by a warming trend for Thursday and
Friday. Both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
200 PM EST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021 - 12Z Sun Dec 05 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada. This will include an organized
low pressure system tracking across southern Canada through Friday
with a trailing front followed by a weaker low this weekend,
leading to rounds of light to moderate precipitation across the
north-central and northeastern U.S. By the weekend, moist inflow
is expected to return to the south-central U.S., bringing
increased rain chances as the moisture focuses along a frontal
boundary.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00/06Z model cycle begins the medium range period Wednesday
with fairly good agreement with the large scale pattern: ridging
through western parts of the U.S. while shortwaves (with varying
intensities depending on the model) pass through mild troughing in
central/eastern parts of the country. A particularly strong
shortwave will push a surface low through southern Canada
Wednesday-Thursday with reasonably good agreement in position. GFS
runs were the strongest with a shortwave tracking quickly through
the Southeast late Wednesday into Thursday, which was not
particularly favored. Magnitude and positioning of shortwaves
continue to be the biggest forecast challenge Friday into the
weekend as well, causing some uncertainties to arise even within
the broader flow by the weekend. In general the flow by the
weekend has trended less amplified compared to model guidance,
with the exception of a southern stream upper low trending a
little stronger across northern Mexico by Sunday, and at this
point it does not appear there are clear outliers with the overall
pattern. Thus the WPC forecast was based initially on a blend of
deterministic guidance of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, UKMET,
and CMC, phasing toward a blend of the models and GEFS and EC
ensemble means by the end of the period, along with some
continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected. Generally moderate precipitation lingering in
the Pacific Northwest, particularly the Olympic Peninsula and
Northern Cascades, should abate for the latter part of the week as
a surface high builds over the Pacific Northwest and British
Columbia, before precipitation chances increase again for the
weekend. Rounds of relatively light precipitation are forecast for
the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast with a progressive storm
track over the area. Amounts should be most substantial in favored
lake effect and possibly upslope areas, particularly downwind of
Lake Ontario into the Adirondacks. Then moisture is set to
increase across the Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley
late Friday and into the weekend, which could lead to rain
becoming more widespread there and northeastward depending on
possible low pressure and frontal system development.

Temperatures are expected to be well above normal for this time of
year across the western U.S. and the Plains through the end of the
week owing to the ridge aloft, and closer to normal for the East
Coast on Wednesday followed by a warming trend for Thursday and
Friday. Both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees
above average for northern and central portions of the High Plains
and expanding into the Midwest for Wednesday and Thursday. A few
locations may approach daily maximum and minimum temperature
records with these mild temperatures. By the weekend, temperatures
are currently forecast to moderate somewhat, but this is subject
to change given forecast uncertainties.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0131 PM CST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

In addition to the ongoing concerns for elevated fire-weather
conditions across parts of Southern California, locally elevated
fire-weather conditions may occur during the afternoon hours across
portions of the southern High Plains with dry/breezy southwesterly
surface winds amid a residual dry airmass and receptive fuels.
However, winds should remain well below critical thresholds,
limiting any large-scale fire-weather concerns at this time.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. See the
discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 11/28/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0134 AM CST Sun Nov 28 2021/

...Synopsis...
A western United States mid-level ridge is forecast to become
suppressed farther southwestward Day 2/Monday as a fast-moving
mid-level shortwave perturbation moves onshore across the Pacific
Northwest and into the central Plains through the end of the period.
Meanwhile, an area of persistent surface high pressure over the
Great Basin is forecast to weaken during the afternoon before
becoming reestablished later Day 2/Monday.

...Southern California...
While some modest moistening of the low-level air mass across inland
portions of Southern California will occur Day 2/Monday, minimum RH
values should still fall to near 10-15%. Elevated to locally
critical fire weather conditions are possible from morning through
at least midday, especially across terrain favored areas, before
surface winds weaken as the pressure gradient relaxes. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may return late Day 2/Monday into
Day 3/Tuesday due to poor overnight RH recoveries and lingering
breeziness. Overall, this fire weather forecast remains on the more
aggressive side of the forecast envelope since most guidance has
tended to underforecast the strength of the pressure gradient
throughout this offshore wind event.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
255 PM EST Sun Nov 28 2021

Valid 00Z Mon Nov 29 2021 - 00Z Wed Dec 01 2021

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Pacific Northwest through Monday morning...

...Heavy lake enhanced snow downwind from the Great Lakes will
start to wind down, and light snow continues for parts of New
England and The Central Appalachians...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 30 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern Rockies and Plains...

A plume of moisture will stream into the Pacific Northwest will
slowly weaken overnight Sunday into Monday. However, the moisture
will produce heavy rain at times over parts of the Northwest
through to Tuesday.  Therefore, the WPC has issued a Marginal Risk
of excessive rainfall over parts of the Pacific Northwest through
Monday morning. The associated areas of heavy rain will create
localized areas of flash flooding, affecting areas that experience
rapid runoff with heavy rain.  The rain will continue on Tuesday
over the Northwest, with less intensity.

Meanwhile, low pressure over the Great Lakes will aid in producing
snow over the Great Lakes into the Northeast/Central Appalachians.
 The snow will taper off early on Monday morning but will return
overnight Monday as a second area of low pressure moves across the
region. In addition, upper-level energy will produce a narrow area
of rain over parts of the Northern/Central Plains overnight Monday
and over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley by Tuesday
evening. Furthermore, upper-level ridging over the western quarter
of the country will allow temperatures to be 15 to 30 degrees
above average over parts of the Northern Rockies and Plains.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sun November 28 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 AM EST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 2 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 6 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada.  This will include an
organized low pressure system tracking across southeastern Canada
through Friday with a trailing front followed by a weaker low this
weekend, leading to rounds of mainly light precipitation across
the Great Lakes and northeastern U.S.  By the weekend, showers and
some storms are likely to develop ahead of a developing storm
system from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
through Friday with an upper ridge over the southwestern U.S. and
a broad trough over the Northeast U.S.  As the flow pattern
becomes more quasi-zonal by Friday night and into the weekend,
model spread increases with respect to the next shortwave trough
entering the northwestern U.S., as well as a weak southern stream
upper low developing over northern Mexico, and overall forecast
confidence is below average for this time period owing to
significant run-to-run model variations.  Some of the greatest
model differences are with the past few runs of the CMC that have
been out of phase along the West Coast for the end of the forecast
period and qualify as outlier solutions compared to ensemble
spaghetti plots for days 6 and 7.  Therefore, the WPC forecast was
primarily based on a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend through Friday, and
then mainly ensemble means with some operational GFS/ECMWF and
some previous WPC continuity.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected through Saturday.  Rounds of relatively light
precipitation are forecast for the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast with a progressive storm track over the area.  Amounts
should be most substantial in favored lake effect and possibly
upslope areas, particularly downwind of Lake Ontario into the
Adirondacks.  Then moisture is set to increase across the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley late Friday and into the
weekend, which could lead to showers and thunderstorms becoming
more widespread there and then extending northeastward as the
surface low over the Great Lakes becomes better organized.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for this time of year
across most of the nation through next weekend, with the greatest
positive anomalies expected for the central and northern Plains
where both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees
above average for late in the week.  A few locations may approach
daily maximum and minimum temperature records with these mild
temperatures.  By the weekend, temperatures are currently forecast
to moderate somewhat, but this is subject to change given forecast
uncertainties.  No arctic airmass intrusions are expected during
this forecast period.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 AM EST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 2 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 6 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada.  This will include an
organized low pressure system tracking across southeastern Canada
through Friday with a trailing front followed by a weaker low this
weekend, leading to rounds of mainly light precipitation across
the Great Lakes and northeastern U.S.  By the weekend, showers and
some storms are likely to develop ahead of a developing storm
system from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z guidance suite is in decent synoptic scale agreement
through Friday with an upper ridge over the southwestern U.S. and
a broad trough over the Northeast U.S.  As the flow pattern
becomes more quasi-zonal by Friday night and into the weekend,
model spread increases with respect to the next shortwave trough
entering the northwestern U.S., as well as a weak southern stream
upper low developing over northern Mexico, and overall forecast
confidence is below average for this time period owing to
significant run-to-run model variations.  Some of the greatest
model differences are with the past few runs of the CMC that have
been out of phase along the West Coast for the end of the forecast
period and qualify as outlier solutions compared to ensemble
spaghetti plots for days 6 and 7.  Therefore, the WPC forecast was
primarily based on a GFS/ECMWF/UKMET blend through Friday, and
then mainly ensemble means with some operational GFS/ECMWF and
some previous WPC continuity.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0129 AM CST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the western United States is forecast
to become suppressed southwestward today as a mid-level shortwave
perturbation quickly moves from the Pacific Northwest into the
central Plains. At the surface, high pressure over the eastern Great
Basin and Rockies is forecast to weaken through this afternoon
before becoming reestablished across the northern Great Basin
tonight.

...Southern California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are anticipated
through at least midday today across inland areas of southern
California with sustained surface winds near 15-20 mph overlapping
widespread critical minimum RH values and receptive fuels. As has
been the case the past several days, locally critical conditions are
most likely in terrain-favored areas of Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, where enhanced surface winds are expected. Surface winds
are forecast to diminish rather rapidly during the afternoon as the
pressure gradient relaxes, which should temporarily temper
large-scale fire weather concerns. Though, elevated to locally
critical conditions may return during the overnight as the pressure
gradient strengthens amidst poor overnight RH recoveries.

...Georgia/South Carolina/North Carolina...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected
this afternoon across the Southeast as north/northwesterly sustained
surface winds near 10-15 mph occur in conjunction with minimum RH
values of 25-35% and increasingly receptive fuels.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0130 AM CST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging is forecast to gradually rebuild across the
western United States Day 2/Tuesday as an area of surface high
pressure over the northern Great Basin strengthens while building
southward.

...Southern California...
At least locally elevated fire weather conditions are likely to
continue into Day 2/Tuesday morning as poor overnight RH recoveries
occur in conjunction with strengthening surface winds. Thereafter,
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are anticipated
throughout the day as critical RH values develop amidst sustained
surface winds of 15-20 mph. Near critical fire weather conditions
are possible overnight Day 2/Tuesday into Day 3/Wednesday as the
pressure gradient strengthens and RH recoveries remain poor.
Locations most likely to experience critical conditions include the
wind-prone areas of Ventura and Los Angeles counties where
strong/gusty winds are expected by late in the period. At this time,
confidence in critical criteria being met prior to Day 3/Wednesday
is too low for a Critical upgrade.

...Southeast...
The combination of a dry airmass (e.g., near critical minimum RH
values), modestly breezy afternoon surface winds (e.g., 10-15 mph),
and receptive fuels will likely promote several hours of at least
locally elevated fire weather conditions from late morning through
the afternoon.

...Light to moderate rain showers to continue over portions of the
Pacific Northwest...

...Lake effect snow showers continue across Great Lakes region
over the next couple of days...

...Warmer temperatures ahead for much of the country; Elevated
Fire Weather Risk for southern California...

A quieter and warmer pattern is ahead for much of the country as
upper-level energy remains either over Canada or stationary off
the Baja coast. A deepening low pressure system off the Northeast
coast will cause gusty winds across New England this afternoon
through tonight. A weak clipper system will bring another round of
snow showers to the Great Lakes region over the next two days.
Snowfall totals will remain marginal, but areas downwind of the
Great Lakes may receive higher amounts due to lake effect
enhancement. A weak atmospheric river will impact much of British
Columbia, Canada and parts of the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday.
Rainfall amounts in the U.S. will be highest over areas that
border British Columbia such as the northern Cascades and Olympic
mountains due to orographic enhancement. Only a few inches of rain
are expected to accumulate over the area once the AR event ends on
Tuesday night.

Persistent upper-level ridging and a cutoff low over Baja
California will contribute to warm air spreading across the CONUS
over the next several days. Temperatures are expected to be above
average for much of the country by midweek

A quieter and warmer pattern is in store for much of the country
as upper-level energy remains either over Canada or stationary off

coast will cause gusty winds across New England this afternoon
through tonight. A weak clipper system will bring yet another

areas downwind of the Great Lakes may receive higher amounts due
to lake effect enhancement. A weak atmospheric river will arrive
over much of British Columbia, Canada and parts of the Pacific
Northwest on Tuesday. Rainfall amounts in the U.S. will be highest
over areas that border British Columbia such as the northern
Cascades and Olympic mountains due to orographic enhancement. Only
a few inches of rain are expected to accumulate by the time that
the AR event ends on Tuesday night.

Persistent upper-level ridging in the West longwave troughing in
the East and a cutoff low over Baja California will contribute to
the spread of warm air across the much of the CONUS over the next
several days. Temperatures are expected to be between 25-30
degrees above average over much of the Northern/Central Plains
today, while the east experiences a cooldown in the wake of a
deepening area of low pressure system and its associated cold
front moving into the North Atlantic. Temperatures will moderate a
bit on Tuesday before another substantial warm-up returns to the
Northern Plains on Wednesday and spreads east through the end of
the week. The Rockies will experience this warm spell too, which
should be disappointing to snow lovers, particularly in the
Central Rockies area, as much of the region continues to
experience a dryer than normal snow season. Elevated Fire Weather
Risk is in effect for parts of southern California through Tuesday
due to marginally dry and windy conditions.

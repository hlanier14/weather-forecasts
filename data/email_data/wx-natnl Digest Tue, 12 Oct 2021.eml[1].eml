Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1152 AM CDT Mon Oct 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF
CALIFORNIA...

Expanded the elevated area closer to the coast in central California
based on current observations and morning forecast guidance. Winds
are already above 20 mph across most of the Central Valley with
relative humidity in the 30s. The forecast remains on track for
critical conditions for most of this afternoon into the early
evening.

..Bentley.. 10/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0216 AM CDT Mon Oct 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-/upper-level low will lift northeast from the southern
Plains toward the Great Lakes today, while at the same time, a
powerful mid-/upper-level jet dives south over California. The
western jet will strengthen to over 100 knots on Monday as it carves
out a 500-millibar trough across the western United States.

At the surface, a low will slowly fill between Monday and Tuesday
mornings as it moves from southwest Missouri into northern
Wisconsin. A second low will deepen across southern Nevada on Monday
due to the strengthening mid-/upper-level jet across California.
This low will move through northern Arizona overnight Monday on its
way to southern Utah by Tuesday morning.

... Central Valley of California ...

As the Nevada surface low deepens, the surface-pressure gradient
across California will correspondingly increase, yielding strong,
northerly surface winds across much of California. At the same time,
strong diurnal heating will allow for downward momentum transport of
the increasing mid-level jet, supporting stronger, gustier winds
than the surface-pressure gradient alone supports.

Winds will range from 15-25 mph near coastal areas of northern
California to in excess of 60 mph atop favored peaks, with
widespread winds around 30 mph across much of the critical area.
Relative humidity should fall into the teens across most areas on
Monday, with overnight recoveries ranging from 25% in some areas to
more than 50%, especially in favored/sheltered valleys. With fuels
across the area receptive to rapid fire spread owing to the
long-term drought, widespread elevated and critical fire conditions
are likely on Monday into Monday night.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT October 11 2021

SYNOPSIS: An area of strong mid-level low pressure forecast over western No=
rth
America is likely to promote onshore flow and above-normal precipitation fo=
r
the West Coast of the contiguous U.S. There are elevated chances for heavy,
and
possibly record-breaking precipitation amounts over portions of central and
northern California during week-2. Early in the period, surface high pressu=
re
behind an advancing cold front may lead to frost and near freezing nighttim=
e
temperatures to affect susceptible vegetation over portions of the eastern =
and
central CONUS. Below normal temperatures are favored over southern Mainland
Alaska, however minimum nighttime temperatures are not expected to reach
hazard
thresholds.

HAZARDS

High risk of heavy precipitation for northern California, Wed-Fri, Oct 20-2=
2.

Moderate risk of heavy precipitation for California and adjacent Oregon,
Tue-Sat, Oct 19-23.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for much of the West Coast states, Tue-M=
on,
Oct 19-25.

Slight risk of high winds for much of the western U.S., Tue-Mon, Oct 19-25.

Slight risk of much below-normal temperatures for parts of the Mississippi,
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, Appalachians, Southeast, and the Mid-Atlantic,
Tue,
Oct 19.

weather concerns across the western CONUS during week-2. By the outset of
week-2, there is fair agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles featur=
ing
much of the anomalous troughing remaining offshore in the northeastern
Pacific,
with downstream ridging and positive height departures overspreading much o=
f
the north-central U.S. By days 9 and 10, models bring this troughing onshor=
e
across the western CONUS, with the mean trough axis extending into southern
California and settling here by the middle of the period. The predicted
mid-level pattern favors enhanced onshore flow, increasing the potential fo=
r
heavy precipitation over the Pacific Northwest and many parts of California=
.



Over the past few days, there has been good run-to-run continuity in both t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools highlighting this heavy precipitation
potential
during early to mid next week with at least a 20% chance of 3-day
precipitation
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch over the northern ha=
lf
of California and the Pacific Northwest. This supports the continuation of =
a
slight risk of heavy precipitation over the central West Coast region for t=
he
entirety of week-2, where hazard thresholds are lower than farther north in
the
Pacific Northwest. Higher probabilities (>40%) exist in the reforecast
guidance
over central and northern California where the ECMWF continues to be quite
robust with this hazard potential, depicting probabilities in excess of 60%
(40%) of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th (98th) percentile a=
nd
2
inches through the middle of the period, suggestive of possible near record
breaking precipitation. Thus, a high risk of heavy precipitation is posted =
in
the outlook from approximately the San Francisco Bay area to Redding,
California for Oct 20 to 22, and a broader moderate risk area is issued
extending into the southern Central Valley for Oct 19 to 23.



While the elevated risk for heavy precipitation may trigger localized flood=
ing
over burn scarred areas of the State, the increase in moisture is anticipat=
ed
to quell ongoing wildfire activity, help improve drought conditions, curren=
tly
ranging from D0 to D4 across Oregon and California, and replenish water
resources throughout the West Coast. According to the California Data Excha=
nge
Center (CDEC), many reservoir levels across the central and northern portio=
n
of
the State remain less than 50% of the historical average. High elevation he=
avy
snow is possible in the Sierra Nevada's and Cascades during the period, tho=
ugh
temperatures are not expected to be markedly colder than normal, precluding
the
addition of any snow related hazards. Additionally, reforecast tools also
depict increased chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile
tied
to the enhanced onshore flow and possible atmospheric river activity. Thus,=
 a
slight risk of high winds is issued for the entirety of week-2.



During late week-1, a broad area of high surface pressure behind a large co=
ld
front extending from the Gulf of Mexico through the Northeast is forecast t=
o
bring anomalous cold temperatures for much of the southeastern CONUS. As th=
is
surface high and the accompanying cold temperatures shift eastward early in
week-2, reforecast tools depict increased chances for nighttime minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below 40 degrees F. Whil=
e
freezing and near freezing temperatures are not especially atypical during
this
time of the year across the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the potential for
frost
may adversely affect vulnerable vegetation, and a slight risk of much below
normal temperatures is posted for Oct 19 to 20. Temperatures are expected t=
o
moderate later in the period, with some model solutions beginning to favor
shortwave troughing and additional surface low development over southern
Canada
to help bring another round of anomalously cold air across the north-centra=
l
CONUS. However, given differences between the ensembles in regards to this
transient mid-level feature, as well as a lack of support in the reforecast
tools, no hazard related areas are posted.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is monitoring a pai=
r
of
tropical waves in the Caribbean and the western main development region bot=
h
with a low chance of formation over the next five days. Both the GEFS and C=
FS
are showing signs of Kelvin wave activity over the Americas early next week
which may help to incite tropical cyclone (TC) activity, however the
large-scale environment is expected to remain unfavorable for development, =
as
reflected in the latest ensemble and probabilistic guidance. These two
disturbances will continue to be monitored and addressed in subsequent
outlooks
this week should they show signs of any organization and track towards the
CONUS.



Over Alaska, the aforementioned mid-level troughing is expected to bring
below-normal temperatures across the southwestern Mainland and the Aleutian=
s,
with above-normal precipitation favored across the Southeast and Panhandle.
The
ECMWF reforecast tool appears bullish with at least a 40% chance of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile mainly across the western
Mainland whereas the GEFS keeps these higher probabilities mostly offshore.
Given these disparities in the reforecast guidance, and where negative
temperature anomalies do not approach hazard thresholds in the raw ensemble
means, no temperature related hazards are posted for the state.

...A very active weather pattern on tap across large portions of
the Western and Central U.S....

...Early Season Heavy Snows likely across the Northern to Central
Rockies into portions of the Northern High Plains and eastern
Great Basin...

...Widespread Heavy Rains, localized Flash Flooding and Severe
weather possible across much of the Plains...

...Big temperature contrast across the country as a battle of the
seasons commences...

The next several days will see a very active weather pattern
across large portions of the Western and Central U.S., producing
potentially high impact to life threatening weather events.  A
deepening mid to upper level low across the Great Basin and
Southwest will support an expanding area of heavy snows Monday,
Tuesday into early Wednesday across the Northern to Central
Rockies, eastern portions of the Great Basin and into the Northern
High Plains.  Winter Storm Watches and Warnings are currently in
effect across much of these areas where snow fall totals of 1 to 2
feet are possible.  This same system will also support increasing
thunderstorm activity Tuesday night into Wednesday across large
portions of the Plains ahead of a strong cold front pushing
eastward across these areas.    Heavy rains, isolated flash
flooding and the risk of severe weather will accompany these
storms, with the greatest risk of severe weather and flash
flooding across portions of the Central to Southern Plains.

Additional heavy rains and the risk of Flash Flooding will push
back into portions of the Southern Plains Wednesday night into
Thursday as moisture associated with currently Hurricane Pamela
off the west coast of Mexico is transported northeastward into the
above mentioned frontal zone which is forecast to become
stationary over the Southern Plains at this time.  While Pamela
will likely weaken rapidly when it moves inland into western
Mexico Wednesday, its associated moisture will have a longer lived
impact as it is transported northeast into the frontal zone across
the Southern Plains Wednesday night into Thursday, supporting the
heavy rain and flash flooding potential.

This active pattern, producing weather from both winter and
summer, will also result in large temperature contrast across the
nation over the next few days.  Much below average temperatures
are likely from the Northern High Plains, westward through the
Rockies and Great Basin, while much above average temperatures
will persist across nearly all of the Central to Eastern U.S.

Valid 12Z Thu Oct 14 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021

18Z Update:  Overall confidence in the synoptic scale pattern
across the continental U.S. is above average for the medium range
period with good agreement among the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means.  There is also less model spread with
tropical cyclone Pamela compared to yesterday once it crosses
Mexico Wednesday night and into Thursday.  Today's 12Z CMC is much
more aligned with the model consensus and ensemble means across
the western U.S. for the weekend, whereas the prior 00Z run was
definitely considered an outlier solution and teleconnections did
not favor it.  The 12Z UKMET is also in better alignment by having
a more amlified solution for the trough reaching the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday compared to its flatter 00Z run.  For the cold
front reaching the East Coast this upcoming weekend, the GFS and
UKMET favor a faster passage, whereas the ECMWF/CMC are suggesting
a wave on the front that could delay its arrival by roughly 12
hours or so.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a 00Z
ECMWF/ECENS/UKMET/6Z GFS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF/ECENS with some previous WPC continuity for
Saturday-Monday.  The previous WPC discussion follows below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Expect an amplified western trough/eastern ridge upper pattern at
the start of the period on Thursday, supporting unseasonably
chilly temperatures over the West and very warm conditions over
the East.  A front extending from low pressure tracking into
Canada will separate the two air masses, with moisture from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (forecast to pass just to
the southeast of the southern tip of Baja California as a major
hurricane around Tuesday night/early Wednesday) likely enhancing
rainfall along the front.  Highest totals are likely over the
southern Plains but some heavy rain is possible farther northeast.
 Then during the weekend into early next week the mean flow will
become less amplified and more progressive.  This will support a
drying trend over the central/eastern U.S. and a moderation of
temperatures closer to normal over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The combination of exact timing of the western upper trough as it
emerges into the central U.S. along with timing of Pamela continue
to present forecast challenges for resolving the details of one or
more frontal waves that should track northeastward from the
southern Plains.  Recent GFS runs have tended to be faster than
the ECMWF with the western trough and slower with Pamela.  CMC
runs have been slowest with the western trough and fastest with
Pamela.  A steady faster trend for Pamela in the GFS over the past
12 hours is narrowing that spread though.  After early Friday
UKMET runs have been straying a lot flatter than consensus over
western North America where consensus has been building a
ridge--leading to questionably fast progression of the trough
heading into the East.

By the latter half of the period some Pacific/western North
America details have changed over the past day or so.  Latest
trends are for a more pronounced upper trough to develop south of
Alaska around early next week, ultimately leading to greater
inland progression of the shortwave currently forecast to be
nearing the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia by very early
Sunday.  On the positive side, by day 7 Monday the 12Z/18Z models
and their ensemble means were quite agreeable for the system
tracking across southern Canada and bringing a frontal system into
the northern Plains.  After early Sunday the new 00Z CMC goes
wildly astray from its continuity or other guidance, digging a
deep trough into the West by Monday.  Teleconnections relative to
the upstream Pacific trough greatly favor the other models and
ensemble means.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z operational
models from Thursday into early Friday but then removed the UKMET
and minimized CMC influence since those models were on opposite
extremes of the envelope over the central/eastern U.S. and the
UKMET compared increasingly poorly to consensus over the West.
The blend eventually went to a model/mean mix consisting mostly of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means.  While the forecast
employed a general blend, some surface details from the southern
Plains northeastward still ended up having somewhat more of an
ECMWF flavor--and are generally maintained in the new 00Z run.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Southern Plains heavy rainfall that should already be in progress
may continue into Thursday, followed by some of the enhanced
rainfall continuing northeastward into portions of the Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast during Friday-Saturday.
Guidance has been providing a consistent signal for an upper
trough emerging from the West and moisture from Pamela interacting
with a wavy front to produce the heavy rainfall over the southern
Plains.  However frontal wave details continue to vary
significantly enough in the guidance to keep confidence low for
resolving the most likely axis of potentially heavy rain farther
northeast.  Continue to monitor forecasts as details hopefully
gain more clarity soon.  By Sunday much of the eastern U.S. should
be dry aside from lingering moisture over the eastern Great
Lakes/New England and parts of Florida.

The upper trough initially over the West will produce a brief
period of rain and higher elevation snow over the central Rockies
on Thursday.  Models have been trending steadily higher with
precipitation totals over the past couple days.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest late this week
may become heavier over the Olympics and northern Cascades around
Saturday with the approach of a Pacific shortwave.  Expect a
lighter trend heading into early next week.

On Thursday the West will see significant coverage of highs 15-30F
below normal with a few record cold highs possible.  Such
anomalies will shrink a little on Friday and more so by Saturday,
with more scattered areas still seeing highs 10F or more below
normal.  Highs should be within a few degrees of normal over the
West by the start of next week while system progression may bring
moderately above normal readings into parts of the Plains by
Sunday-Monday.  In the East, highs will be 10-15F above normal
over at least the northern two-thirds of the region Thursday into
Saturday while anomalies for morning lows will be even higher,
possibly exceeding plus 20F from the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes
into the central Appalachians.  A broad area of record warm lows
will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward.
Progression of the Plains cold front into the East will erode the
warmth from the west late week into the weekend, ultimately
bringing near to slightly below normal highs to the East by
Sunday-Monday.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 17 - 21 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. A trough with below normal 500-hPa heights is forecast ove=

Alaska extending southward into the northeastern Pacific and into the west
coast of the CONUS. Strong mean ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomali=

Predicted troughing over the northeastern Pacific increases the chances of

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR OCT 19 - 25 2021

During week-2, the 500-hPa flow pattern is similar to the 6-10 day mean

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

352 PM EDT Mon Oct 11 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Oct 14 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021

18Z Update:  Overall confidence in the synoptic scale pattern
across the continental U.S. is above average for the medium range
period with good agreement among the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means.  There is also less model spread with
tropical cyclone Pamela compared to yesterday once it crosses
Mexico Wednesday night and into Thursday.  Today's 12Z CMC is much
more aligned with the model consensus and ensemble means across
the western U.S. for the weekend, whereas the prior 00Z run was
definitely considered an outlier solution and teleconnections did
not favor it.  The 12Z UKMET is also in better alignment by having
a more amlified solution for the trough reaching the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday compared to its flatter 00Z run.  For the cold
front reaching the East Coast this upcoming weekend, the GFS and
UKMET favor a faster passage, whereas the ECMWF/CMC are suggesting
a wave on the front that could delay its arrival by roughly 12
hours or so.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a 00Z
ECMWF/ECENS/UKMET/6Z GFS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF/ECENS with some previous WPC continuity for
Saturday-Monday.  The previous WPC discussion follows below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Expect an amplified western trough/eastern ridge upper pattern at
the start of the period on Thursday, supporting unseasonably
chilly temperatures over the West and very warm conditions over
the East.  A front extending from low pressure tracking into
Canada will separate the two air masses, with moisture from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (forecast to pass just to
the southeast of the southern tip of Baja California as a major
hurricane around Tuesday night/early Wednesday) likely enhancing
rainfall along the front.  Highest totals are likely over the
southern Plains but some heavy rain is possible farther northeast.
 Then during the weekend into early next week the mean flow will
become less amplified and more progressive.  This will support a
drying trend over the central/eastern U.S. and a moderation of
temperatures closer to normal over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The combination of exact timing of the western upper trough as it
emerges into the central U.S. along with timing of Pamela continue
to present forecast challenges for resolving the details of one or
more frontal waves that should track northeastward from the
southern Plains.  Recent GFS runs have tended to be faster than
the ECMWF with the western trough and slower with Pamela.  CMC
runs have been slowest with the western trough and fastest with
Pamela.  A steady faster trend for Pamela in the GFS over the past
12 hours is narrowing that spread though.  After early Friday
UKMET runs have been straying a lot flatter than consensus over
western North America where consensus has been building a
ridge--leading to questionably fast progression of the trough
heading into the East.

By the latter half of the period some Pacific/western North
America details have changed over the past day or so.  Latest
trends are for a more pronounced upper trough to develop south of
Alaska around early next week, ultimately leading to greater
inland progression of the shortwave currently forecast to be
nearing the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia by very early
Sunday.  On the positive side, by day 7 Monday the 12Z/18Z models
and their ensemble means were quite agreeable for the system
tracking across southern Canada and bringing a frontal system into
the northern Plains.  After early Sunday the new 00Z CMC goes
wildly astray from its continuity or other guidance, digging a
deep trough into the West by Monday.  Teleconnections relative to
the upstream Pacific trough greatly favor the other models and
ensemble means.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z operational
models from Thursday into early Friday but then removed the UKMET
and minimized CMC influence since those models were on opposite
extremes of the envelope over the central/eastern U.S. and the
UKMET compared increasingly poorly to consensus over the West.
The blend eventually went to a model/mean mix consisting mostly of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means.  While the forecast
employed a general blend, some surface details from the southern
Plains northeastward still ended up having somewhat more of an
ECMWF flavor--and are generally maintained in the new 00Z run.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Southern Plains heavy rainfall that should already be in progress
may continue into Thursday, followed by some of the enhanced
rainfall continuing northeastward into portions of the Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast during Friday-Saturday.
Guidance has been providing a consistent signal for an upper
trough emerging from the West and moisture from Pamela interacting
with a wavy front to produce the heavy rainfall over the southern
Plains.  However frontal wave details continue to vary
significantly enough in the guidance to keep confidence low for
resolving the most likely axis of potentially heavy rain farther
northeast.  Continue to monitor forecasts as details hopefully
gain more clarity soon.  By Sunday much of the eastern U.S. should
be dry aside from lingering moisture over the eastern Great
Lakes/New England and parts of Florida.

The upper trough initially over the West will produce a brief
period of rain and higher elevation snow over the central Rockies
on Thursday.  Models have been trending steadily higher with
precipitation totals over the past couple days.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest late this week
may become heavier over the Olympics and northern Cascades around
Saturday with the approach of a Pacific shortwave.  Expect a
lighter trend heading into early next week.

On Thursday the West will see significant coverage of highs 15-30F
below normal with a few record cold highs possible.  Such
anomalies will shrink a little on Friday and more so by Saturday,
with more scattered areas still seeing highs 10F or more below
normal.  Highs should be within a few degrees of normal over the
West by the start of next week while system progression may bring
moderately above normal readings into parts of the Plains by
Sunday-Monday.  In the East, highs will be 10-15F above normal
over at least the northern two-thirds of the region Thursday into
Saturday while anomalies for morning lows will be even higher,
possibly exceeding plus 20F from the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes
into the central Appalachians.  A broad area of record warm lows
will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward.
Progression of the Plains cold front into the East will erode the
warmth from the west late week into the weekend, ultimately
bringing near to slightly below normal highs to the East by
Sunday-Monday.

352 PM EDT Mon Oct 11 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Oct 14 2021 - 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021

18Z Update:  Overall confidence in the synoptic scale pattern
across the continental U.S. is above average for the medium range
period with good agreement among the GFS/ECMWF and their
respective ensemble means.  There is also less model spread with
tropical cyclone Pamela compared to yesterday once it crosses
Mexico Wednesday night and into Thursday.  Today's 12Z CMC is much
more aligned with the model consensus and ensemble means across
the western U.S. for the weekend, whereas the prior 00Z run was
definitely considered an outlier solution and teleconnections did
not favor it.  The 12Z UKMET is also in better alignment by having
a more amlified solution for the trough reaching the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday compared to its flatter 00Z run.  For the cold
front reaching the East Coast this upcoming weekend, the GFS and
UKMET favor a faster passage, whereas the ECMWF/CMC are suggesting
a wave on the front that could delay its arrival by roughly 12
hours or so.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a 00Z
ECMWF/ECENS/UKMET/6Z GFS blend through Friday, and then mainly
GFS/ECMWF/ECENS with some previous WPC continuity for
Saturday-Monday.  The previous WPC discussion follows below for
reference. /Hamrick

...Overview...

Expect an amplified western trough/eastern ridge upper pattern at
the start of the period on Thursday, supporting unseasonably
chilly temperatures over the West and very warm conditions over
the East.  A front extending from low pressure tracking into
Canada will separate the two air masses, with moisture from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (forecast to pass just to
the southeast of the southern tip of Baja California as a major
hurricane around Tuesday night/early Wednesday) likely enhancing
rainfall along the front.  Highest totals are likely over the
southern Plains but some heavy rain is possible farther northeast.
 Then during the weekend into early next week the mean flow will
become less amplified and more progressive.  This will support a
drying trend over the central/eastern U.S. and a moderation of
temperatures closer to normal over much of the lower 48.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The combination of exact timing of the western upper trough as it
emerges into the central U.S. along with timing of Pamela continue
to present forecast challenges for resolving the details of one or
more frontal waves that should track northeastward from the
southern Plains.  Recent GFS runs have tended to be faster than
the ECMWF with the western trough and slower with Pamela.  CMC
runs have been slowest with the western trough and fastest with
Pamela.  A steady faster trend for Pamela in the GFS over the past
12 hours is narrowing that spread though.  After early Friday
UKMET runs have been straying a lot flatter than consensus over
western North America where consensus has been building a
ridge--leading to questionably fast progression of the trough
heading into the East.

By the latter half of the period some Pacific/western North
America details have changed over the past day or so.  Latest
trends are for a more pronounced upper trough to develop south of
Alaska around early next week, ultimately leading to greater
inland progression of the shortwave currently forecast to be
nearing the Pacific Northwest/British Columbia by very early
Sunday.  On the positive side, by day 7 Monday the 12Z/18Z models
and their ensemble means were quite agreeable for the system
tracking across southern Canada and bringing a frontal system into
the northern Plains.  After early Sunday the new 00Z CMC goes
wildly astray from its continuity or other guidance, digging a
deep trough into the West by Monday.  Teleconnections relative to
the upstream Pacific trough greatly favor the other models and
ensemble means.

The updated forecast started with a blend of 12Z/18Z operational
models from Thursday into early Friday but then removed the UKMET
and minimized CMC influence since those models were on opposite
extremes of the envelope over the central/eastern U.S. and the
UKMET compared increasingly poorly to consensus over the West.
The blend eventually went to a model/mean mix consisting mostly of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means.  While the forecast
employed a general blend, some surface details from the southern
Plains northeastward still ended up having somewhat more of an
ECMWF flavor--and are generally maintained in the new 00Z run.


...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Southern Plains heavy rainfall that should already be in progress
may continue into Thursday, followed by some of the enhanced
rainfall continuing northeastward into portions of the Ohio
Valley, Great Lakes, and Northeast during Friday-Saturday.
Guidance has been providing a consistent signal for an upper
trough emerging from the West and moisture from Pamela interacting
with a wavy front to produce the heavy rainfall over the southern
Plains.  However frontal wave details continue to vary
significantly enough in the guidance to keep confidence low for
resolving the most likely axis of potentially heavy rain farther
northeast.  Continue to monitor forecasts as details hopefully
gain more clarity soon.  By Sunday much of the eastern U.S. should
be dry aside from lingering moisture over the eastern Great
Lakes/New England and parts of Florida.

The upper trough initially over the West will produce a brief
period of rain and higher elevation snow over the central Rockies
on Thursday.  Models have been trending steadily higher with
precipitation totals over the past couple days.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest late this week
may become heavier over the Olympics and northern Cascades around
Saturday with the approach of a Pacific shortwave.  Expect a
lighter trend heading into early next week.

On Thursday the West will see significant coverage of highs 15-30F
below normal with a few record cold highs possible.  Such
anomalies will shrink a little on Friday and more so by Saturday,
with more scattered areas still seeing highs 10F or more below
normal.  Highs should be within a few degrees of normal over the
West by the start of next week while system progression may bring
moderately above normal readings into parts of the Plains by
Sunday-Monday.  In the East, highs will be 10-15F above normal
over at least the northern two-thirds of the region Thursday into
Saturday while anomalies for morning lows will be even higher,
possibly exceeding plus 20F from the Ohio Valley/Lower Great Lakes
into the central Appalachians.  A broad area of record warm lows
will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley northeastward.
Progression of the Plains cold front into the East will erode the
warmth from the west late week into the weekend, ultimately
bringing near to slightly below normal highs to the East by
Sunday-Monday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0257 PM CDT Mon Oct 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

Sunday evening/overnight precipitation occurred as expected for
portions of the TX/OK Panhandles with around 0.25 to 0.5 inches of
precipitation in most areas. Therefore, despite elevated
meteorological conditions, the elevated delineations will remain
north and south of this region due to increased fuel moisture from
this rainfall. No changes have been made to the previous forecast.
See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 10/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0216 AM CDT Mon Oct 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level low, found in the basal region of the western
United States large-scale trough, will move from northern Arizona
into western Nebraska during the forecast period. As this occurs,
the strong mid-/upper-level jet will weaken across California as it
strengthens across New Mexico and Colorado.

At the surface, the low across Utah early Tuesday morning will
redevelop farther east, across the plains of Colorado by midday
Tuesday. This low will deepen throughout the afternoon as it lifts
north toward the Nebraska Panhandle due to the strengthening
mid-level jet overhead. Farther west, the strong surface-pressure
gradient across California from Monday will relax as the
aforementioned Utah low redevelops farther east.

... Southern and Central High Plains ...

As the surface low deepens and lifts north from Colorado into
Nebraska, southwest winds locally more than 25 mph will develop
across the Colorado plains. The westerly component of the low-level
wind field will result in downsloping and increased adiabatic
warming/drying. Adiabatic warming/drying, in turn, results in
increased vertical mixing, which typically further reduces the
relative humidity. However, in this case, an elevated moist plume
drawn north from the Pacific by the strong mid-level trough is
present. Thus, increased vertical mixing will limit the overall
reduction in relative humidity and therefore mitigate the overall
fire risk. However, given the strength of the low-level wind field
and fuel ERC values expected to be greater than the 90th percentile,
at least elevated fire conditions are expected. If the elevated
moist plume is weaker/drier than currently anticipated, critical
fire weather conditions will be likely. The evolution of this
elevated moist plume will be monitored for future forecasts.

Farther south, across the Texas Panhandle, meteorological conditions
will be similar to the Colorado plains. However, widespread wetting
rains occurred on Sunday, tempering the fire threat for Tuesday.
Future forecasts will reassess fuel trends for potential expansion
of the elevated fire area into the Texas Panhandle.

Even farther south, across West Texas and southeast New Mexico,
surface winds will not be as strong as on Sunday, given the farther
north position of the main mid-level low. However, even a modest
response in the surface winds will result in winds near 20 mph, with
stronger gusts likely. With afternoon relative humidity in the
teens, elevated fire weather conditions will result.

... Central Valley of California and Coastal Areas of Southern
California ...

Strong northerly surface winds will be ongoing at the start of the
forecast period Tuesday in response to a strong surface-pressure
gradient across the region. Please see the current Day 1 Fire
Outlook for more details about the evolution of this surface
pattern. For many areas, the peak surface-pressure gradient winds
will occur during the peak in overnight relative-humidity recovery.
As diurnal heating results in decreasing relative humidity, the
surface-pressure gradient will already be weakening in response to
the filling Utah surface low. As such, the strongest winds and
minimum relative humidity should be offset just enough to preclude
critical fire weather conditions, however, another day of widespread
elevated fire concerns is in store.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0156 AM CDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
A strong mid/upper-level low is forecast to move from the Southwest
this morning into portions of the central/northern High Plains by
late tonight, as a surface cyclone initially near the Four Corners
region redevelops across portions of the central High Plains this
afternoon/evening.

...Central and southern High Plains...
Elevated to potentially critical meteorological conditions are
expected this afternoon across parts of the central/southern High
Plains, behind the dryline that will extend southward from the
aforementioned surface cyclone. The greatest relative fire-weather
risk is expected over portions of east-central and southeast CO,
where sustained winds of greater than 25 mph (with higher gusts) and
minimum RH values of 15-20% are expected. Confidence in a sufficient
coverage and duration of critically low RH precludes an upgrade at
this time. Very isolated dry thunderstorms cannot be ruled out
across this region as well.

Elevated wind/RH conditions are also expected southward into
portions of eastern NM and west TX. Fuels are generally less
receptive in this area compared to areas further north, but the
separate elevated area has been maintained from southeast NM into
far west TX, where fuels are likely somewhat drier compared to areas
of the TX Panhandle and South Plains, where somewhat greater
antecedent rainfall has been observed.

...California...
Somewhat lighter winds are expected today across much of CA compared
to Monday, as the surface low near the Four Corners redevelops
eastward, resulting in a weaker surface pressure gradient. However,
several hours of elevated to near critical conditions are still
expected across parts of northern/central CA into coastal regions of
southern CA, as sustained winds remain in the 15-20 mph range (with
higher gusts) and RH values drop below 15%.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep-layer cyclone is forecast to move from the central High
Plains Wednesday morning toward southern Manitoba by late Wednesday
night. As this occurs, a shortwave mid/upper-level trough will move
from the Pacific Northwest into portions of the Great Basin,
reinforcing the deep longwave trough over the western CONUS.

...Northern CA...
Some increase in northerly low-level flow is possible across parts
of northern CA late Wednesday afternoon into Wednesday night, in the
wake of the reinforcing mid/upper-level shortwave trough moving into
the Great Basin. This scenario would support the potential for
elevated fire-weather conditions. However, at this time, guidance is
not overly strong with northerly flow through the end of the Day 2
period, and any ramp up in winds late Wednesday may occur after some
nocturnal RH recovery, with a greater potential threat into
D3/Thursday. With these factors in mind, no elevated delineation has
been made at this time.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated meteorological conditions are again expected from portions
of eastern NM into the TX Panhandle/South Plains, as low-level
westerly flow remains somewhat enhanced into the afternoon. However,
due to recent rainfall, fuel receptiveness may remain relatively
limited, so no elevated delineation has been made at this time.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
259 AM EDT Tue Oct 12 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Oct 15 2021 - 12Z Tue Oct 19 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that the amplified western
trough/eastern ridge upper pattern in the short range will become
flatter and more progressive heading into the weekend and the
start of next week.  This will support moderating and in some
cases more variable temperatures over much of the lower 48 along
with a drier trend over the central/eastern U.S.  The two main
precipitation areas will be over the East with a wavy front late
this week and over the Pacific Northwest with a system supported
by a vigorous shortwave trough arriving into western North America
by Sunday.  An upper trough amplifying over the eastern Pacific
early next week should start to build a ridge over the western
U.S. by next Tuesday, possibly leading to a gradual deceleration
of that West Coast trough (eventually with a possible embedded
low) as it reaches the northern Plains/Upper Midwest into southern
Canada at that time.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Moderate differences that develop for the timing and shape of the
upper trough reaching the Plains as of Friday continue to cause
difficulties for the forecast of a strengthening frontal wave
likely to track northeast from the southern Plains or Midwest.
Through the 12Z/18Z cycles guidance was arranged similarly to
previous days--with the faster GFS/UKMET shortwave leading to a
farther north developing surface wave relative to the ECMWF and
slowest CMC.  The new 00Z GFS/UKMET maintain their position while
the CMC has finally caught up to the 12Z ECMWF.  Finer details of
the new CMC aloft actually lead to a surface wave faster/north
versus the 12Z ECMWF.  Persistence of these clusters led to
favoring a blend among these ideas to maintain flexibility
depending on future trends, which are now leaning farther away
from the slow side given the faster adjustment in the 00Z ECMWF.

Farther upstream, CMC runs are now oscillating between 12Z runs
that fit the model/mean consensus for the upper trough entering
western North America by Sunday and continuing eastward thereafter
versus 00Z runs that drop a trough/low into the West early next
week.  Teleconnections relative to the negative height anomaly
corresponding to the East Pacific trough late in the period favor
the model/mean majority that has a ridge, not the 00Z CMC
trough/low.  There may be a weak southern stream feature that
tracks into the Southwest though.  Otherwise, for day 7 Tuesday
recent runs of the GFS/ECMWF have both trended noticeably farther
south with the upper low contained within the trough reaching
southern Canada and the Upper Midwest/northern Plains.  For now a
reasonable starting point seems to be a model/mean blend that
yields more of a closed low than the open wave seen in the means
but with a closed low track a little north of the 18Z/00Z GFS or
12Z ECMWF (00Z ECMWF adjusted north).  Also of note, recent GEFS
means have been a little east of other means with the East Pacific
trough and a bit weaker with the downstream ridge/trough.  Thus
the ensemble mean part of the blend tilted somewhat more toward
the ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The southern Plains/Midwest frontal wave expected to strengthen as
it tracks northeastward into Canada from early Friday onward
should produce an axis of moderate to heavy rainfall from near the
Lower Ohio Valley into parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast.  To
some degree the rain may be enhanced by moisture originating from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (expected to become a
hurricane soon per National Hurricane Center Forecast). The latest
00Z model runs still vary some for the details of the frontal wave
but at least are getting closer together than they were
previously.  Expect lighter rainfall to extend southward along the
trailing cold front.  Most of the East will be dry after Saturday
aside from lingering rain over the eastern Great Lakes/northern
New England and the Florida Peninsula.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest on Friday should
become heavier and extend southward by Saturday as an upper trough
and developing surface system approach. Precipitation will become
lighter late in the weekend and possibly trend toward dry
conditions early next week as an upper ridge builds over the West.

Temperatures over the West will begin to moderate slightly on
Friday with highs 10-25F below normal primarily centered over and
near the Rockies.  Less extreme anomalies will extend into the
Plains.  Western temperatures will continue the warming trend
during the weekend.  The north-central Rockies may stay moderately
below normal into early next week while the Northwest through
northern Plains will see temperatures vary with system
progression.  Warmth over the East will continue Friday-Saturday
with many areas seeing highs 10-15F or so above normal and morning
lows 10-20F/locally 20-25F above normal.  A broad area of record
warm lows will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley
northeastward and there may also be a few record highs over the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.  The front crossing the region will
erode the warmth from west to east and its passage will bring near
to slightly below normal highs for Sunday-Tuesday.

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to suggest that the amplified western
trough/eastern ridge upper pattern in the short range will become
flatter and more progressive heading into the weekend and the
start of next week.  This will support moderating and in some
cases more variable temperatures over much of the lower 48 along
with a drier trend over the central/eastern U.S.  The two main
precipitation areas will be over the East with a wavy front late
this week and over the Pacific Northwest with a system supported
by a vigorous shortwave trough arriving into western North America
by Sunday.  An upper trough amplifying over the eastern Pacific
early next week should start to build a ridge over the western
U.S. by next Tuesday, possibly leading to a gradual deceleration
of that West Coast trough (eventually with a possible embedded
low) as it reaches the northern Plains/Upper Midwest into southern
Canada at that time.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Moderate differences that develop for the timing and shape of the
upper trough reaching the Plains as of Friday continue to cause
difficulties for the forecast of a strengthening frontal wave
likely to track northeast from the southern Plains or Midwest.
Through the 12Z/18Z cycles guidance was arranged similarly to
previous days--with the faster GFS/UKMET shortwave leading to a
farther north developing surface wave relative to the ECMWF and
slowest CMC.  The new 00Z GFS/UKMET maintain their position while
the CMC has finally caught up to the 12Z ECMWF.  Finer details of
the new CMC aloft actually lead to a surface wave faster/north
versus the 12Z ECMWF.  Persistence of these clusters led to
favoring a blend among these ideas to maintain flexibility
depending on future trends, which are now leaning farther away
from the slow side given the faster adjustment in the 00Z ECMWF.

Farther upstream, CMC runs are now oscillating between 12Z runs
that fit the model/mean consensus for the upper trough entering
western North America by Sunday and continuing eastward thereafter
versus 00Z runs that drop a trough/low into the West early next
week.  Teleconnections relative to the negative height anomaly
corresponding to the East Pacific trough late in the period favor
the model/mean majority that has a ridge, not the 00Z CMC
trough/low.  There may be a weak southern stream feature that
tracks into the Southwest though.  Otherwise, for day 7 Tuesday
recent runs of the GFS/ECMWF have both trended noticeably farther
south with the upper low contained within the trough reaching
southern Canada and the Upper Midwest/northern Plains.  For now a
reasonable starting point seems to be a model/mean blend that
yields more of a closed low than the open wave seen in the means
but with a closed low track a little north of the 18Z/00Z GFS or
12Z ECMWF (00Z ECMWF adjusted north).  Also of note, recent GEFS
means have been a little east of other means with the East Pacific
trough and a bit weaker with the downstream ridge/trough.  Thus
the ensemble mean part of the blend tilted somewhat more toward
the ECMWF mean.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The southern Plains/Midwest frontal wave expected to strengthen as
it tracks northeastward into Canada from early Friday onward
should produce an axis of moderate to heavy rainfall from near the
Lower Ohio Valley into parts of the Great Lakes/Northeast.  To
some degree the rain may be enhanced by moisture originating from
eastern Pacific Tropical Storm Pamela (expected to become a
hurricane soon per National Hurricane Center Forecast). The latest
00Z model runs still vary some for the details of the frontal wave
but at least are getting closer together than they were
previously.  Expect lighter rainfall to extend southward along the
trailing cold front.  Most of the East will be dry after Saturday
aside from lingering rain over the eastern Great Lakes/northern
New England and the Florida Peninsula.  Light to moderate
precipitation over the northern Pacific Northwest on Friday should
become heavier and extend southward by Saturday as an upper trough
and developing surface system approach. Precipitation will become
lighter late in the weekend and possibly trend toward dry
conditions early next week as an upper ridge builds over the West.

Temperatures over the West will begin to moderate slightly on
Friday with highs 10-25F below normal primarily centered over and
near the Rockies.  Less extreme anomalies will extend into the
Plains.  Western temperatures will continue the warming trend
during the weekend.  The north-central Rockies may stay moderately
below normal into early next week while the Northwest through
northern Plains will see temperatures vary with system
progression.  Warmth over the East will continue Friday-Saturday
with many areas seeing highs 10-15F or so above normal and morning
lows 10-20F/locally 20-25F above normal.  A broad area of record
warm lows will be possible from the Lower Mississippi Valley
northeastward and there may also be a few record highs over the
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.  The front crossing the region will
erode the warmth from west to east and its passage will bring near
to slightly below normal highs for Sunday-Tuesday.

...An early-season heavy snow event in the northern/central
Rockies will spread into the northern High Plains tonight and into
Wednesday...

...Widespread heavy rains, localized flash flooding and severe
weather across much of the Plains for the next couple of days...

...Big temperature contrast across the country as a battle of the
seasons commences...

An early-season heavy snow event is in progress across the
northern and central Rockies this morning as a large area of low
pressure continues to develop just to the south.  Snow is
expanding in coverage across these areas and is expected to become
heavier as the day progresses.  The low pressure system is
forecast to intensify further through tonight as it tracks
northeastward across central High Plains towards the northern
Plains.  The snow is expected to be quite heavy to the west of the
storm track over the northern High Plains tonight.   Winter Storm
Watches and Warnings are currently in effect where snowfall totals
of 1 to 2 feet are possible.  In addition, the heavy snow will be
accompanied with very strong and gusty north to northwesterly
winds during the height of the storm.  This will likely result in
blowing and drifting of the snow as the storm continues to
intensify.     By Wednesday, the heavy snow and high winds will
likely spread further north into the western Dakotas and eastern
Montana.  This same system will also support increasing
thunderstorm activity tonight into Wednesday across large portions
of the Plains ahead of a strong cold front pushing eastward across
these areas.  Heavy rains, isolated flash flooding and the risk of
severe weather will accompany these storms, with the greatest risk
of severe weather and flash flooding across portions of the
Central to Southern Plains.

Additional heavy rains and the risk of Flash Flooding will push
back into portions of the Southern Plains Wednesday night into
Thursday as moisture associated with currently Hurricane Pamela
off the west coast of Mexico is transported northeastward into the
above-mentioned frontal zone which is forecast to become
stationary over the Southern Plains at this time.  While Pamela
will likely weaken rapidly when it moves inland into western
Mexico Wednesday, its associated moisture will have a longer lived
impact as it is transported northeast into the frontal zone across
the Southern Plains Wednesday night into Thursday, supporting the
heavy rain and flash flooding potential.

This active pattern, producing weather conditions of both winter
and summer, will also result in large temperature contrast across
the nation over the next few days.  Much below average
temperatures are likely from the Northern High Plains, westward
through the Rockies and Great Basin, while much above average
temperatures will persist across nearly all of the Central to
Eastern U.S.

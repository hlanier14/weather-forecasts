Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
359 AM EDT Tue Jun 15 2021

Valid 12Z Tue Jun 15 2021 - 12Z Thu Jun 17 2021

...Heat will continue across portions of the West and Plains, with
record-breaking temperatures and fire danger in some areas...

...Rain and thunderstorms are forecast across Florida over the
next couple of days with some isolated flash flooding possible...

A strong upper-level ridge centered across the Four Corners region
will help sustain a heat wave for the majority of the western U.S.
over the next several days, with the north-central U.S. also
seeing periods of hot weather. Temperatures well into the 110s to
lower 120s are forecast for the Desert Southwest. Meanwhile over
Montana, high temperatures well into the 100s will be as much as
30 degrees above average today. Dozens (possibly hundreds) of
daily record high maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to
be set over the next few days in California, the Intermountain
West, Desert Southwest, Rockies, and High Plains. High
temperatures across the lower elevations of the Central Rockies
region could even challenge all-time records today and Wednesday
at some locations. Given the heat, dry conditions, and gusty
winds, fire danger is a concern throughout much of the West, and
Critical Risks of fire weather are in place today across portions
of Nevada, Utah, and Montana.

However, the exception to the Western heat will be the Northwest,
which can expect cooler than average temperatures as well as rain
chances today behind a cold front. Rain chances should decrease in
the Northwest on Wednesday, but winds are likely to strengthen as
a low pressure system intensifies in western Canada. The cold
front should push temperatures closer to normal in Montana on
Wednesday, and also help trigger some thunderstorms in the Dakotas
toward the Midwest on Wednesday into Thursday. Isolated storms
could be strong to severe there.

Scattered thunderstorms are likely across the Gulf Coast region
over the next couple of days, and there is a Marginal Risk for
severe weather (with gusty winds and hail the main threats) across
the central/eastern Gulf Coast and the coastal Carolinas today
into tonight. The Florida Peninsula in particular should see good
coverage of thunderstorms, and heavy downpours could cause
isolated flash flooding there. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Bill will
continue moving northeastward over the Atlantic and will not cause
any direct impacts to the U.S. However, some showers and
thunderstorms are possible in the Northeast today as a couple of
fronts move through the region, which will also cause below normal
temperatures.

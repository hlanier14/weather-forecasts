Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1024 AM CST Fri Jan 28 2022

Valid 281700Z - 291200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The overall forecast remains on track with no changes. Localized
elevated fire weather conditions may be possible across portions of
the High Plains with locally gusty downslope winds and warming
temperatures. However, recent snow cover may temper fuels somewhat
suggesting any threat will likely remain localized and isolated. See
the previous discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 01/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CST Fri Jan 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
50+ kt north-northwesterly flow at 500 mb will overspread the
central Plains states today as a mid-level trough impinges on the
Atlantic Coastline. Surface high pressure across the Plains will
allow for modest downslope westerly surface flow from southwest
South Dakota into the Texas Panhandle through the afternoon hours.
While surface temperatures are expected to be on the cool side (i.e.
struggling to exceed 50F) across the central and southern High
Plains, RH is expected to drop into the 15-25% range by afternoon
peak heating. The latest guidance consensus suggests that patchy
areas of 15+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are possible
from the Nebraska to Texas Panhandles this afternoon. However,
overall cooler temperatures and the fragmented nature of the
stronger surface winds preclude Elevated highlights this outlook.

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

A weak shortwave moving through the southern Plains on Monday
should generate enhanced rainfall along/north of the Texas Gulf
Coast, before shearing out pretty quickly on Tuesday due to a
building ridge over the western Atlantic. After this, troughing
will dig into the West Tuesday-Wednesday and shift/expand eastward
into the central U.S. Thursday. By Friday, broad longwave
troughing should cover much of the CONUS as strong ridging builds
over the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic. This evolution is
expected to bring widespread precipitation along a leading frontal
boundary into much of the eastern half of the country mid-late
next week, with potential for notable wintry weather on the
backside of the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance remains in generally good agreement for the
overall large scale pattern, but with continuing uncertainty in
the smaller scale details. Models are pretty consistent with the
track of the initial compact southern stream upper low over Texas
Monday and into the Gulf early Tuesday before shearing out with
somewhat variable timing. A multi-model deterministic blend worked
well for this feature. In the northern stream, a couple of
shortwaves moving across the Great Lakes region toward the western
Atlantic early in the workweek showed good agreement in the 00Z
and 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, with some slightly different solutions
in the 00Z CMC and UKMET.

Then there is good consensus with energy diving south through the
Intermountain West for the first half of the workweek, serving to
deepen the trough in the west-central U.S., but with lingering
uncertainty on the exact magnitude--the 00Z UKMET was deeper than
other guidance/most ensemble members by early Wednesday. The trend
toward less separation of streams within the trough has remained
for the past couple of cycles, so there is a building consensus
with that. Then by Thursday into Friday, there are some additional
differences with shortwave features within the broader trough.
Energy moving through the base of the trough Thursday exhibits
some differences that also affect frontal and surface low position
by Friday in the Northeast, while model guidance also varies with
strength of energy possibly dipping through the western side of
the trough. In general the GFS runs have been stronger with this
feature (with the exception of the 06Z GFS) compared to ECMWF
runs, but the 12Z ECMWF came in with a stronger shortwave than its
past runs. So the run-to-run inconsistencies as well as notable
differences in individual ensemble members show this aspect is
still uncertain.

The WPC forecast used a multi-model deterministic blend favoring
the GFS and ECMWF early in the period, gradually phasing in some
proportion of the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble means to about 40
percent by the end of the period to maintain some definition of
systems but smooth individual model differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper shortwave/low into the Southern Plains by Monday will
bring a threat for locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern
Texas across parts of the Gulf Coast region during the first half
of next week. The best potential still appears to be over eastern
Texas, with some potential for heavy rainfall farther east along
the Gulf Coast depending on the exact track of the mid-upper
energy. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Monday-Tuesday will spread light to moderate amounts of lower
elevation rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest
eastward and southeastward into much of the Rockies. In general,
the forecast remains on track for a significant increase of
coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central U.S.
the second half of the week as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best chance for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. Wintry weather will be possible on the
northwest side of the moisture shield, with at least some
potential for meaningful snow from central parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley northeastward through the Great Lakes and into
the interior Northeast. While confidence in a heavy rain area
appears better than average, details with the wintry precipitation
in the colder air may be more dependent on lower-confidence
details of ejecting shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures initially over the Plains on Monday
should spread eastward Tuesday-Thursday as upper ridging builds
in. Behind this, arctic high pressure dives into the Central U.S.
behind the cold front midweek, bringing chilly and much below
normal temperatures all the way from the northern Rockies/High
Plains southward into Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and
slightly less extreme overnight lows) as much as 10-20 degrees
below average are possible. Locally higher values as much as 25F
below normal are possible across the north-central U.S. The below
normal temps may moderate slightly as they shift east into the
Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next Friday. Much of the West Coast
states should be near normal through much of next week owing to
amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

159 PM EST Fri Jan 28 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 31 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 04 2022

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

A weak shortwave moving through the southern Plains on Monday
should generate enhanced rainfall along/north of the Texas Gulf
Coast, before shearing out pretty quickly on Tuesday due to a
building ridge over the western Atlantic. After this, troughing
will dig into the West Tuesday-Wednesday and shift/expand eastward
into the central U.S. Thursday. By Friday, broad longwave
troughing should cover much of the CONUS as strong ridging builds
over the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic. This evolution is
expected to bring widespread precipitation along a leading frontal
boundary into much of the eastern half of the country mid-late
next week, with potential for notable wintry weather on the
backside of the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance remains in generally good agreement for the
overall large scale pattern, but with continuing uncertainty in
the smaller scale details. Models are pretty consistent with the
track of the initial compact southern stream upper low over Texas
Monday and into the Gulf early Tuesday before shearing out with
somewhat variable timing. A multi-model deterministic blend worked
well for this feature. In the northern stream, a couple of
shortwaves moving across the Great Lakes region toward the western
Atlantic early in the workweek showed good agreement in the 00Z
and 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, with some slightly different solutions
in the 00Z CMC and UKMET.

Then there is good consensus with energy diving south through the
Intermountain West for the first half of the workweek, serving to
deepen the trough in the west-central U.S., but with lingering
uncertainty on the exact magnitude--the 00Z UKMET was deeper than
other guidance/most ensemble members by early Wednesday. The trend
toward less separation of streams within the trough has remained
for the past couple of cycles, so there is a building consensus
with that. Then by Thursday into Friday, there are some additional
differences with shortwave features within the broader trough.
Energy moving through the base of the trough Thursday exhibits
some differences that also affect frontal and surface low position
by Friday in the Northeast, while model guidance also varies with
strength of energy possibly dipping through the western side of
the trough. In general the GFS runs have been stronger with this
feature (with the exception of the 06Z GFS) compared to ECMWF
runs, but the 12Z ECMWF came in with a stronger shortwave than its
past runs. So the run-to-run inconsistencies as well as notable
differences in individual ensemble members show this aspect is
still uncertain.

The WPC forecast used a multi-model deterministic blend favoring
the GFS and ECMWF early in the period, gradually phasing in some
proportion of the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble means to about 40
percent by the end of the period to maintain some definition of
systems but smooth individual model differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper shortwave/low into the Southern Plains by Monday will
bring a threat for locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern
Texas across parts of the Gulf Coast region during the first half
of next week. The best potential still appears to be over eastern
Texas, with some potential for heavy rainfall farther east along
the Gulf Coast depending on the exact track of the mid-upper
energy. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Monday-Tuesday will spread light to moderate amounts of lower
elevation rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest
eastward and southeastward into much of the Rockies. In general,
the forecast remains on track for a significant increase of
coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central U.S.
the second half of the week as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best chance for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. Wintry weather will be possible on the
northwest side of the moisture shield, with at least some
potential for meaningful snow from central parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley northeastward through the Great Lakes and into
the interior Northeast. While confidence in a heavy rain area
appears better than average, details with the wintry precipitation
in the colder air may be more dependent on lower-confidence
details of ejecting shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures initially over the Plains on Monday
should spread eastward Tuesday-Thursday as upper ridging builds
in. Behind this, arctic high pressure dives into the Central U.S.
behind the cold front midweek, bringing chilly and much below
normal temperatures all the way from the northern Rockies/High
Plains southward into Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and
slightly less extreme overnight lows) as much as 10-20 degrees
below average are possible. Locally higher values as much as 25F
below normal are possible across the north-central U.S. The below
normal temps may moderate slightly as they shift east into the
Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next Friday. Much of the West Coast
states should be near normal through much of next week owing to
amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST January 28 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating mid-level low pressure dominating the eastern
two-thirds of the contiguous U.S. from the beginning to middle of week-2,
gradually weakening and shifting eastward with time. These models indicate =
a
transition to mid-level low pressure centered across the central lower 48,
with
mid-level high pressure across the western and eastern thirds of the
contiguous
U.S. However, there is increasing uncertainty by the end of the period
regarding the details of the mid-level pattern. A series of surface lows ar=
e
anticipated to form over the Aleutians during week-2, which could promote
enhanced precipitation and high elevation snowfall over parts of southeaste=
rn
Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle at the beginning of the period, as
well as episodes of high winds across portions of southern Mainland Alaska =
and
the Alaska Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the eastern
half
of the CONUS and Southern Plains, Sat, Feb 5.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across much of the eastern ha=
lf
of the CONUS, Southern Plains, and New Mexico, Sat-Tue, Feb 5-8.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Northern and Central Plains,
Sat-Sun, Feb 5-6.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across coastal portions of southern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Sat-Wed, Feb 5-9.

Slight risk of episodes of heavy precipitation across parts of southeastern
Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Sat-Wed, Feb 5-9.

Slight risk of episodes of heavy snow across high elevation areas of the
Chugach and Kenai mountains and the Alaska Panhandle, Sat-Wed, Feb 5-9.

FOR MONDAY JANUARY 31 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 04:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!vO8PedkxEZPuVT-OYMluDOHP9DbZi9PB887h9mUsXicnwboZEs09A4zbAUoQ4=
5NyqrkzmiUI$

FOR SATURDAY FEBRUARY 05 - FRIDAY FEBRUARY 11: There is good multi-model
agreement indicating mid-level troughing across the eastern two thirds of t=
he
CONUS from the beginning to middle of week-2, continuing the anomalously co=
ld
pattern across much of the eastern half of the country including portions o=
f
the South-Central CONUS. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is
highlighted across much of the eastern half of the CONUS, Southern Plains, =
and
New Mexico, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools are in good agreement
indicating at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the low=
est
15th percentile and falling below 0 Deg F across the Midwest and Northeast,
and
below freezing across the southern tier. The GEFS reforecast tool extends
reaching this criteria until day 12 (Feb 9), but the ECMWF reforecast tool =
is
significantly weaker. Models generally indicate a transition to near to abo=
ve
normal mid-level heights toward the end of the period, which would translat=
e
to
milder temperatures across the East. The highlighted moderate risk area is
expanded and shifted eastward compared to yesterday's outlook, but is only =
for
day 8 (Feb 5), where both reforecast tools show at least a 40% chance of
minimum temperatures reaching hazards criteria.



Multiple model ensemble means continue to indicate possible surface low
formation over the Northern Plains while surface high pressure develops ove=
r
the Northern and Central Rockies, which could support episodes of high wind=
s
across the Northern and Central Plains. Recent deterministic GFS and ECMWF
model runs also support this feature. A slight risk of high winds is
maintained
for the Northern and Central Plains, Feb 5 to 6, where the reforecast tools
are
in good agreement indicating wind speeds having a 20% chance or greater of
exceeding the 85th percentile and 20 mph.



The 0Z deterministic GFS indicates surface low formation off the coast of t=
he
Southeast tracking across coastal portions of the Mid-Atlantic coast. Howev=
er,
more recent GFS runs (6Z and 12Z) and the 0Z deterministic ECMWF keep any
surface low formation well offshore. Due to high uncertainty regarding this
feature, no related hazards are designated at this time.



There is better agreement among model ensemble means compared to yesterday
regarding the mid-level pattern over Alaska during week-2. Mid-level trough=
ing
is anticipated across portions of northern and western Alaska at the start =
of
the period, with ridging across the rest of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. This mid-level ridge is predicted to overspread much of the stat=
e
throughout the period, excluding the western Aleutians as this feature
retrogrades during week-2.



There continues to be good multi-model depiction of a series of surface low=
s
forming over the Aleutians during the period, increasing the likelihood for
related hazards over southern portions of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle. There are noticeable differences regarding the details of the
orientation and evolution of these storms, leading to ensemble model means
favoring different days that would have the greatest impacts. Therefore, a
broad region and time period is highlighted for possible related hazards. A
slight risk of rounds of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of
southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, Feb 5 to 9, with heavy snow
anticipated for higher elevation areas of the Chugach and Kenai mountains a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle. The reforecast tools show at least 20% chance of 3-da=
y
liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches, locall=
y,
for the highlighted risk areas. A slight risk of episodes of high winds is
also
posted for coastal portions of southern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle, =
Feb
5 to 9, associated with these potential systems. The reforecast tools indic=
ate
at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 40 m=
ph
in the designated risk area.

the latest guidance. See below for additional information.

..Lyons.. 01/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CST Fri Jan 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly mid-level flow will prevail across the Plains
states as an upper ridge across the Interior West slowly approaches
the Rockies tomorrow/Saturday. An embedded mid-level impulse will
traverse the Central Plains tomorrow, with surface lee-troughing
across the Plains states ushering in dry surface air from the High
Plains. By afternoon peak heating, widespread 15-20 percent RH is
expected to overspread much of the central and southern Plains.
Portions of central Nebraska will be overspread by stronger flow
aloft given the passage of the embedded mid-level impulse,
encouraging relatively widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly winds
coinciding with the lower RH. When also considering the dry fuels
across the central Plains, Elevated highlights have been introduced
for portions of central Nebraska into extreme northern Kansas.

Weaker upper support across the southern Plains should keep surface
winds below 15 mph on a widespread basis from southeast Colorado
into western Texas eastward to central Oklahoma. However, the 15-20
percent RH by afternoon peak heating overspreading dry fuels may
support at least localized fire-spread concerns. Should guidance
depict more widespread stronger winds across the southern Plains,
Elevated highlights may be introduced.

Lastly, 15 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds overlapping
25-35 percent RH may accompany a post-cold frontal environment
across the Florida Peninsula tomorrow afternoon. While such
conditions would typically warrant Elevated highlights, relatively
high fuel moisture/low forecast ERCs suggest that fuel receptiveness
is mediocre, precluding fire weather highlights this outlook.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri January 28 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 03 - 07 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
a
 trough is forecast over the western Aleutians, while anomalous ridging is
predicted across the Gulf of Alaska and parts of the western CONUS. Anomalo=
us
troughing is forecast over the central CONUS, extending southward to the
Southern Plains. Anomalous ridging and associated above normal 500-hPa heig=
hts
are likely across the northeastern CONUS.

Ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights over the western CONUS lead to
increased chances of near to above normal temperatures over parts of the We=
st
Coast. Conversely, troughing over the central CONUS favors elevated
probabilities for near to below normal temperatures over the remainder of t=
he
CONUS. Increased below normal temperature probabilities are indicated over
northern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above nor=
mal
temperatures are likely for southern Alaska associated with above normal
500-hPa heights.

The potential for enhanced offshore flow and predicted mean surface high
pressure increase chances of below normal precipitation for the western CON=
US
eastward to the west of the Appalachians. Above normal precipitation is
favored
over parts of the eastern CONUS, northeastern North Dakota, Northern Minnes=
ota
and southern Texas, associated with cyclonic flow and potential storm syste=
ms
development. Mean southwesterly flow leads to increased chances of above
normal
precipitation over much of Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 8, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 05 - 11 2022

The week-2 manual blend of model 500-hPa forecasts is generally similar to =
the
6-10 day period. However, predicted 500-hPa height anomalies are less
amplified
than in the 6-10 day period blend, as uncertainty among the model forecasts
increases. Ridging persists for the Gulf Alaska and western CONUS into the
week-2 period, with downstream troughing slightly progressing eastward in
week-2 relative to the 6-10 day period.

Below normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS, the Mississipp=
i
Valley, Great Lakes, and parts of the Southern Plains and the southern
Rockies,
under a predicted mean  trough. Near to above normal temperatures are favor=
ed
over the western CONUS, parts of the Northern Rockies, Northern and Middle
Plains in week-2, as mid-level heights are predicted to rise during the
period.
Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for northwestern Mainland
Alaska
for week-2, under continued anomalous northwesterly flow. Above normal
temperatures are favored over most of southern and central  Mainland Alaska=
,
the Aleutians, and Alaska Panhandle under southerly surface flow.

Above normal precipitation is favored for parts of the Northern Plains, Upp=
er
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and Southern Plains, associated with mean
cyclonic flow and potential storm systems development. Below normal
precipitation is favored for the remainder of the CONUS associated with mea=
n
surface high pressure predicted across most of these regions. Above normal
precipitation is favored for much of Alaska under predicted southwesterly
500-hPa flow in the manual blend.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

...Powerful winter storm to produce significant impacts across
parts of
New England and coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on Saturday...

...Below-average temperatures will expand across the eastern third
of the country this weekend before moderating next week; Great
Plains warm up this weekend...

A developing area of low pressure off the Southeast Coast will
deepen rapidly while moving northeastward just offshore from the
East Coast. The Nor'easter will move into the Canadian Maritimes
overnight Saturday. The storm will produce widespread impacts to
the I-95 corridor from the Mid-Atlantic to New England. Snowfall
accumulations greater than 12 inches are expected along portions
of the Mid-Atlantic Coast through eastern New England, with local
maxima greater than 24 inches across eastern Massachusetts,
including the Boston metro. Heavy snow rates and strong winds will
produce dangerous blizzard conditions along portions of the
Mid-Atlantic and New England coasts. Expect whiteout conditions
and nearly impossible travel at times. The strong to damaging
winds will lead to scattered power outages. Also, significant
coastal impacts are possible, including coastal flooding and beach
erosion. Moreover, very cold temperatures will follow the storm
with dangerous wind chills Saturday night into Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, low pressure moving southeastward from Central Canada
will move across the Great Lakes to Eastern Ohio Valley/Central
Appalachians by Sunday evening. The system will produce light snow
across the Great Lakes and parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley
into parts of the Central Appalachians overnight Saturday into
Sunday. The heaviest accumulations will be along parts of the
Lakes Superior and Michigan coastline. Additionally, a front will
move onshore over the Pacific Northwest on Sunday, while the
associated upper-level energy will produce light rain over parts
of the Northwest Coast overnight Saturday. By Sunday morning, the
rain will move farther inland and light snow will develop over the
higher elevations and snow will develop over parts of the Northern
Rockies by Sunday evening.

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

A weak shortwave moving through the southern Plains on Monday
should generate enhanced rainfall along/north of the Texas Gulf
Coast, before shearing out pretty quickly on Tuesday due to a
building ridge over the western Atlantic. After this, troughing
will dig into the West Tuesday-Wednesday and shift/expand eastward
into the central U.S. Thursday. By Friday, broad longwave
troughing should cover much of the CONUS as strong ridging builds
over the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic. This evolution is
expected to bring widespread precipitation along a leading frontal
boundary into much of the eastern half of the country mid-late
next week, with potential for notable wintry weather on the
backside of the system.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance remains in generally good agreement for the
overall large scale pattern, but with continuing uncertainty in
the smaller scale details. Models are pretty consistent with the
track of the initial compact southern stream upper low over Texas
Monday and into the Gulf early Tuesday before shearing out with
somewhat variable timing. A multi-model deterministic blend worked
well for this feature. In the northern stream, a couple of
shortwaves moving across the Great Lakes region toward the western
Atlantic early in the workweek showed good agreement in the 00Z
and 06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF, with some slightly different solutions
in the 00Z CMC and UKMET.

Then there is good consensus with energy diving south through the
Intermountain West for the first half of the workweek, serving to
deepen the trough in the west-central U.S., but with lingering
uncertainty on the exact magnitude--the 00Z UKMET was deeper than
other guidance/most ensemble members by early Wednesday. The trend
toward less separation of streams within the trough has remained
for the past couple of cycles, so there is a building consensus
with that. Then by Thursday into Friday, there are some additional
differences with shortwave features within the broader trough.
Energy moving through the base of the trough Thursday exhibits
some differences that also affect frontal and surface low position
by Friday in the Northeast, while model guidance also varies with
strength of energy possibly dipping through the western side of
the trough. In general the GFS runs have been stronger with this
feature (with the exception of the 06Z GFS) compared to ECMWF
runs, but the 12Z ECMWF came in with a stronger shortwave than its
past runs. So the run-to-run inconsistencies as well as notable
differences in individual ensemble members show this aspect is
still uncertain.

The WPC forecast used a multi-model deterministic blend favoring
the GFS and ECMWF early in the period, gradually phasing in some
proportion of the 06Z GEFS and 00Z EC ensemble means to about 40
percent by the end of the period to maintain some definition of
systems but smooth individual model differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper shortwave/low into the Southern Plains by Monday will
bring a threat for locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern
Texas across parts of the Gulf Coast region during the first half
of next week. The best potential still appears to be over eastern
Texas, with some potential for heavy rainfall farther east along
the Gulf Coast depending on the exact track of the mid-upper
energy. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Monday-Tuesday will spread light to moderate amounts of lower
elevation rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest
eastward and southeastward into much of the Rockies. In general,
the forecast remains on track for a significant increase of
coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central U.S.
the second half of the week as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best chance for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. Wintry weather will be possible on the
northwest side of the moisture shield, with at least some
potential for meaningful snow from central parts of the Plains and
Mississippi Valley northeastward through the Great Lakes and into
the interior Northeast. While confidence in a heavy rain area
appears better than average, details with the wintry precipitation
in the colder air may be more dependent on lower-confidence
details of ejecting shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures initially over the Plains on Monday
should spread eastward Tuesday-Thursday as upper ridging builds
in. Behind this, arctic high pressure dives into the Central U.S.
behind the cold front midweek, bringing chilly and much below
normal temperatures all the way from the northern Rockies/High
Plains southward into Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and
slightly less extreme overnight lows) as much as 10-20 degrees
below average are possible. Locally higher values as much as 25F
below normal are possible across the north-central U.S. The below
normal temps may moderate slightly as they shift east into the
Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states next Friday. Much of the West Coast
states should be near normal through much of next week owing to
amplified ridging across the East Pacific.

...Next week to bring heavy precipitation to the central and
eastern U.S., including winter weather from the Central Plains to
Great Lakes and interior Northeast around midweek...


...Overview...

Upper level ridging over both the western Atlantic and East
Pacific will allow for a shortwave to dig into the western U.S.
Tuesday-Wednesday, shifting east into the Plains on Thursday.
Another shortwave should drop into the base of the trough on
Thursday across the Southwest which will help to reinforce/amplify
the trough as it tracks into the Midwest/East Friday and Saturday.
This evolution is expected to bring widespread precipitation along
and ahead of a leading frontal boundary into much of the eastern
half of the country mid-late next week, with increasing potential
for wintry weather on the backside of the system.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Recent model guidance remains in generally good agreement for the
overall large scale pattern, but with continuing uncertainty in
the smaller scale details. Models remain pretty consistent with
the track of the initial compact southern stream upper low over
the Gulf on Tuesday before shearing out with somewhat variable
timing as upper ridging builds off the East Coast. Meanwhile, in
the northern stream, a shortwave moving across the Great Lakes and
Northeast early in the workweek also shows good agreement in the
deterministic models.

There continues to be increasing consensus with energy diving
south through the Intermountain West Tuesday-Wednesday, serving to
deepen the trough into the Central U.S.. A trend towards less
separation of streams with the trough has remained, but models are
showing timing differences into the southern Plains/Midwest which
affects frontal and surface low position by Friday. The ECMWF and
CMC are faster than the GFS and UKMET (through day 5 at least),
but the ensemble means tend to fall somewhere in between. There
also seems to be a trend towards a stronger shortwave diving into
the Southwest around Friday but with a lot of uncertainty by
Saturday/day 7 regarding strength and timing, as exhibited by the
latest ensemble spaghetti plots.

The WPC forecast for tonight used a purely multi-model
deterministic blend for days 3-5. After that, increased weighting
of the GEFS/ECENS ensemble means to help mitigate some of the late
period differences. Given better than average agreement on the
large scale though, was still able to maintain 50 percent of the
deterministic GFS/ECMWF (and smaller parts CMC) through day
7/Saturday. Overall, this maintained good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast for days 3-6.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Some moderate rain may be possible along the central Gulf Coast on
Tuesday associated with weakening southern stream energy out over
the Gulf and increasing moisture ahead of the next system into the
West. The bigger threat during the medium range period though is a
developing trough over the West and into the Central U.S. by
Wednesday. Initially on Tuesday, this feature should spread mainly
light to moderate lower elevation rain and mountain snow across
the Rockies. The forecast however remains on track for a
significant increase of coverage and intensity of precipitation
over the east-central U.S. by Wednesday and beyond as the upper
trough emerges from the Rockies and the leading cold front
interacts with a strong low level feed of Gulf moisture. The best
chance for heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the
Mississippi Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Appalachians and the East. The pattern certainly favors a heavy to
excessive rainfall threat, but the exact location of where this
sets up any flooding/flash flooding impacts remains quite
uncertain still. Wintry weather will be possible on the northwest
side of the moisture shield, with increasing potential for
meaningful snow from central parts of the Plains and Mississippi
Valley northeastward through the Great Lakes and into the interior
Northeast. While heavy rainfall to the south seems fairly certain,
the details with the wintry precipitation in the colder air may be
more dependent on lower-confidence details of ejecting shortwave
energy and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures will spread eastward Tuesday-Thursday
across the Eastern third of the country with daytime highs as much
as 15-20 degrees above normal along the East Coast on Friday. At
the same time, arctic high pressure dives into the Central U.S.
behind the cold front midweek, bringing chilly and much below
normal temperatures all the way from the northern Rockies/High
Plains southward into Texas. Widespread daytime highs (and
slightly less extreme overnight lows) as much as 10-25 degrees
below average are possible. The below normal temps may moderate
slightly as they shift east into the Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states
next Friday and the East on Saturday. The West Coast states should
be near normal through much of next week owing to amplified
ridging across the East Pacific.

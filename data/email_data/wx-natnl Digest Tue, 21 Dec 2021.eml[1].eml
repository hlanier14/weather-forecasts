Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1052 AM CST Mon Dec 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and very minimal changes
were made with this update. Elevated to spotty near-critical
conditions are expected to continue through this afternoon across
parts of central and southern NM. However, the isolated coverage of
critical conditions precludes the introduction of a Critical Area.
Farther north across portions of southeastern CO into northeastern
NM, briefly elevated conditions will be possible this afternoon.
With that said, the anticipated brief and spotty nature of the
conditions precludes highlights.

..Weinman.. 12/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Mon Dec 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough evident in water vapor imagery this morning over
northern Mexico and West Texas will continue moving eastward along
the Gulf Coast throughout the day.  Meanwhile, a shortwave midlevel
ridge will build into the Southwest today.  At the surface, high
pressure will dominate conditions over most of the CONUS, as low
pressure systems move eastward across eastern Canada and the Gulf of
Mexico.

...Portions of Central/Southern New Mexico...
In the wake of the departing midlevel trough, enhanced northwesterly
flow aloft will help support downslope flow in the lee of the high
terrain across the region.  As a result, subsidence and downward
mixing will promote dry and windy conditions for terrain-favored
locations.  Given the dry airmass already in place, RH values are
expected to fall into the single digits, as sustained northwesterly
surface winds approach 20 mph.  Given the dry fuels across the
region (80th percentile ERC values), elevated fire weather
conditions are likely from the late morning through the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 PM CST Mon Dec 20 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

Only minor adjustments were made to the Outlook, as the previous
forecast remains on track. Between the two Elevated Areas, dry and
locally breezy conditions will be possible across terrain-favored
areas along and west of the I-25 corridor. This will especially be
the case over areas such as Canon City and Walsenburg CO, where
localized gap flows will briefly enhance the westerly surface winds.
However, coverage will be too spotty/localized to introduce
highlights.

..Weinman.. 12/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CST Mon Dec 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
With an upper-level ridge in place over the Southwest, a potent
shortwave trough is forecast to move from the northern Rockies
across the top of the ridge, leading to enhanced flow aloft over
much of the central and southern High Plains.  At the surface, a
weak low pressure system is forecast to move eastward across the
northern Plains toward the Great Lakes while an associated cold
front moves southward through the central Plains.  A lee trough is
forecast to become established along the High Plains by Tuesday
afternoon.

...East-Central New Mexico into Adjacent Portions of West Texas...
As the aforementioned shortwave moves through to the north, an
enhanced belt of northwesterly flow across the region will promote
dry and windy conditions through downslope effects.  Critical RH
values are likely to be widespread along the High Plains from
southeastern Wyoming southward through West Texas, with single
digits likely in the lee of high terrain in eastern New Mexico.
Sustained northwesterly surface winds are likely to approach 20 mph,
elevating fire weather conditions.  Critical fire weather conditions
may be possible, but the current forecast timing of the shortwave is
too early for the stronger winds to be realized at the surface.

...Far Southeastern Wyoming into Adjacent Portions of Northern
Colorado and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Despite cool temperatures (highs only in the 40s F) across the
region, the winds will be very strong just above the surface (>50
mph at 1000 ft AGL).  Downslope processes in the lee of the high
terrain should aid in warming, drying, and mixing of strong winds
down to the surface, resulting in elevated to locally critical fire
weather conditions.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

During the extended period there will be multiple shortwaves
tracking around the very strong ridge over the central Pacific
Ocean into the Bering Sea/Alaska which will dive into and
reinforce an amplified trough whose axis should be near the West
Coast, possibly drifting slightly inland later in the period.
These ejected impulses are depicted to be carried downstream that
will support the development of a pair of low pressure systems.
With a broad trough near the West Coast, a large area of
precipitation will be maintained for several days. Also of note, a
strong temperature contrast will set up between well above normal
temperatures progged for the Central and Southern Plains while
well below normal temperatures settles in over the extreme
Northern Plains.

The first major feature of note will be a West Coast shortwave
that ejects eastward after early Thursday and likely produces a
Plains through southeastern Canada/Northeast U.S. system around
Friday and Christmas Day/Saturday. There has been a notable
variability with the timing/strength/progression etc the past few
models runs but is favoring a less amplified solution. There is a
reasonable signal in the models and ensemble means that another
general area of low pressure should evolve over the central U.S.

model preferences included the 00Z/06Z GFS, 00Z ECWMF/CMC/UKMET
with increasing weighting of the EC ensemble, the NAEFS and GEFS
means by the latter periods.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A persistent plume of moisture will be directed onshore the West
Coast ahead of multiple shortwaves digging into the West Coast
mean trough aloft with moisture and terrain enhancement extending
as far east as the Rockies and to southern California/Great Basin.
Moderate to heavy precipitation can be expected over the western
half of the Pacific Northwest and portions of California, which
will increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to local runoff;
however uncertainty on timing and shortwave interactions will
temper confidence in resolving the exact location and intensity of
lower elevation rainfall with respect to local runoff/flooding
issues over California. Abundant lift and moisture into the
favored upslope areas of the Oregon Cascades and the Sierra Nevada
will likely result in the highest accumulations and liquid
equivalents. Meaningful precipitation will likely be observed
across the highest terrain of the Great Basin and the Central and
Northern Rockies. The timing and amounts of precipitation over
southern parts of the West have become more of a question mark
with latest adjustments in the models. Colder air filtering into
the Northwest may lead to very low snow levels by next
Sunday-Monday while other parts of the West may also see declining
snow levels as the upper trough axis nudges eastward.

Across the northern tier, an initial system is expected to spread
spread precipitation across the northeastern section of the
country. Another low pressure system will pass through the
northern states by next week ushering precipitation with some
spots of snow to northern states and also the east-central U.S.
Temperatures will be colder than seasonal average, with many
locations in the Dakotas and Montana averaging 15 to 30 degrees F
below normal for late December. Additionally, the West will begin
to trend cooler by the end of the extended forecast with daily
highs around 10 to 15 degrees F cooler.

For the Central and Southern Plains there won't be a White
Christmas because temperatures will be quite toasty, with daily
maximums around 15 to 25 degrees F above the mean for late
December. A few locations may actually surpass 30 degrees F above
average Friday
The central and southern Plains will see much above normal
temperatures for most of the period with plus 15-25F anomalies.
Highs could even reach or exceed 30F above normal at some
locations on Friday. Daily records for highs/warm lows will be
possible where temperatures are most anomalous and this warmth
will spread into the East U.S.

...Developing area of low pressure in the Gulf of Mexico to
deliver locally heavy rain across northern Florida and the
Southeast coast on Tuesday before potentially spreading wintry
precipitation into Maine on Wednesday...

...Unsettled weather persists over the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies into the middle of the week...

Wet weather is in the forecast throughout parts of the Sunshine
State and adjacent sections of the Southeast between tonight and
Tuesday afternoon. A low pressure system strengthening over the
Gulf of Mexico is expected to track northeast and over the
northern Florida Peninsula on Tuesday. As it does so, an attached
warm front is expected to lift into the region and fuel numerous
showers and scattered thunderstorms. A few storms will have the
potential to produce heavy rain and instances of flash flooding,
particularly along Florida's central and northern Atlantic
coastline. Isolated severe weather is also a possibility
throughout much of the Florida Peninsula on Tuesday until a cold
front clears southern sections of the state by Tuesday evening.
Showers will also spread into parts of the Southeast and the
eastern Carolinas through early Wednesday as the aforementioned
low pressure system passes by to the east. By Wednesday afternoon,
precipitation is expected to blossom to the north of the low as an
approaching upper-level shortwave interacts with the coastal
system. As a result, wintry weather may extend into parts of
northern New England and Maine on Wednesday. Mixed precipitation
and freezing rain is possible along coastal Maine, with the
potential for heavy snow located just inland. However, there
remains rather large uncertainty regarding exactly how far inland
the impactful precipitation will reach.

Elsewhere, the aforementioned upper-level shortwave is currently
found across the Northwest and responsible for light-to-moderate
snow extending into the Northern Rockies tonight. This area of
light snow will race across the Northern Plains and into the Upper
Midwest by Tuesday morning, where a few inches of accumulating
snow is possible. Parts of the Upper Great Lakes will also enjoy
some festive snowfall on Tuesday and Tuesday night. For the
immediate western U.S. coastline, continuous onshore flow will
allow for unsettled weather on Tuesday until the next system
approaches on Wednesday. Heavy snow is possible across the Cascade
Mountains and Sierra Nevada, as well as periods of
moderate-to-heavy rain along the northern California and Oregon
coast.

For much of the central U.S., dry and mild weather is in store
through midweek as below average and bitterly cold temperatures
remain confined to the Northern Plains.

6ARmkrJNK6E$

FOR TUESDAY DECEMBER 28 - MONDAY JANUARY 03: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadi=
an
ensemble means are in good agreement depicting an amplified positively tilt=
ed
mid-level trough continuing from week-1 into the beginning of week-2 over t=
he
western CONUS, gradually weakening throughout the period. This pattern
supports
increased chances for anomalous cold across the western third and north-
central
CONUS during the period. There is good agreement among the reforecast tools
indicating an increased risk of much below normal temperatures across the
West.
A broad area of slight risk (>20% chance) of much below normal temperatures=
 is
highlighted across parts of the western half of the CONUS throughout the
period
where the reforecast tools depict at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures
falling to the lowest 15th percentile. Many of these areas are anticipated =
to
fall to below 20 Deg F,  with the interior West dropping below 0 Deg F, and
the
north-central tier falling to below -20 Deg F. Embedded moderate (>40% chan=
ce)
and high (>60% chance) risk areas are posted for parts of the Northwest and
north-central CONUS, Dec 28-31, and Dec 28-29, respectively, as supported b=
y
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools. The reforecast tools indicate increase=
d
chances for some areas having at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures
falling to the lowest first percentile, particularly across Washington,
northern Idaho, and Montana. This is suggestive of near record cold
temperatures at the beginning of the period over these areas.



Mid-level troughing across the West is predicted to continue to support
enhanced moisture over portions of the western half of the CONUS. The GEFS
ensemble mean indicates enhanced integrated vapor transport values exceedin=
g
250 kg/ms primarily focused south of Mexico throughout much of the period,
with
the ECMWF ensemble not indicating this signal. Despite these differences,
there
is still good model agreement regarding the increased potential for enhance=
d
precipitation across the West. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is
designated for parts of Oregon and California, Dec 28-30; and a slight risk=
 of
heavy snow for higher elevations of the Klamath River Basin, Sierra Nevada =
and
Cascades, Dec 28-30. This trough, combined with possible surface low format=
ion
off the coast of Mexico enhancing the moisture feed, supports a slight risk=
 of
localized heavy snow across higher elevation areas of the Great Basin, Four
Corners region, and Northern and Central Rockies, Dec 28-30. A broad area i=
s
highlighted where the reforecast tools indicate some areas exceeding 3-day
liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch. He=
avy
snow could increase the potential for travel hazards, especially given the
increased travel after the holidays.



The mid-level trough across the West may support surface low formation acro=
ss
parts of Oregon and Northern California. With surface high pressure
anticipated
westward over the northeastern Pacific, a slight risk of high winds is post=
ed
for coastal portions of Oregon and northern and central California, Dec 28-=
29.
The GEFS reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of this area
experiencing wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph, with the
ECMWF reforecast tool indicating a weaker signal due to the ECMWF ensemble
mean
favoring a more inland solution of the mid-level trough axis compared to th=
e
GEFS, which is more aligned over the Northwest coast.



There is good agreement among the ensemble means indicating the potential f=
or
surface low formation in the lee of the central and southern Rockies at the
beginning of the period, potentially supporting enhanced wind speeds in the
region. A slight risk of high winds is highlighted for parts of the Central
and
Southern High Plains, Dec 28-30, where there is good agreement between the
reforecast tools indicating at least 20% chance of high winds exceeding the
85th percentile and 25 mph.



Across the East, possible frontal activity combined with increased moisture
flow associated with surface high pressure over the Southeast, may bring
enhanced precipitation to the southeastern CONUS. A slight risk of heavy
precipitation is identified for parts of the southeastern quadrant of the
CONUS, Dec 30-Jan 1, where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance =
of
3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch.



Over Alaska, mid-level troughing is forecast over the Alaska Panhandle from
the
beginning to middle of the period. Surface high pressure extending from
eastern
Mainland Alaska into the Panhandle is likely to increase chances for much
below
normal temperatures for parts of week-2. A slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted for the southeastern Mainland of Alaska and the
Alaska Panhandle, Dec 28 to Jan 1, while a moderate risk is posted for the
Panhandle, Dec 28-29, where the reforecast tools indicate increased
probabilities of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile=
.
The reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of parts of the Panhandle
nearing record low temperatures.



A surface low over the Bering Sea at the beginning of the period may suppor=
t
high winds across coastal portions of western Mainland Alaska. A slight ris=
k
of
high winds is posted for this region, Dec 29-Jan 1, where there is good
agreement among the reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of wi=
nd
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon December 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 26 - 30 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs models are in exceptionally good agreemen=
t on the predicted 500-hPa
flow pattern across most of the forecast domain. A strong mid-level ridge
currently extending from the north-central Pacific Ocean into Alaska should
remain approximately in place through the 6-10 day period. Except for some
runs
of the GFS, the array of models have a very narrow range of solutions - all
center the positive 500-hPa height anomalies in the north-central Pacific
Ocean
within a few degrees latitude of each other, and with very similar magnitud=
es.
Models have less agreement on how far north the ridge axis will push into
Alaska, but this should not greatly affect the prevailing weather pattern
there. Models also broadly agree that a strong mid-level trough will remain
across the western CONUS, centered near the British Columbia border, which
would bring above normal precipitation to much of the western CONUS, and al=
low
exceptionally cold air to push into the northern Rockies and Plains,
moderating
only slightly during the period. Models are nearly unanimous in developing =
a
strong mid-level ridge in the northern latitudes, with the largest 500-hPa
height anomalies centered just west of Davis Strait. In addition, an anomal=
ous
trough is forecast in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, again with little
variability in the location and magnitude of this feature. One feature mode=
ls
do not agree on is the weak ridge centered over the southeastern CONUS. The
GFS
and GEFS ensemble means extend the ridge northward through the eastern Grea=
t
Lakes, while the European and Canadian ensembles favor a flatter ridge, wit=
h
below-normal 500-hPa heights in the Great Lakes region. Teleconnections to =
the
strong ridge in northern Canada favors mild mid-level troughing in the east=
ern
CONUS while the strong north Pacific ridge favors a ridge along the East
Coast.
The models favor a flatter, slightly westward-extending ridge centered over
the
Southeast but not extending into the northeastern CONUS. The consensus of
models and other tools favor a flatter ridge extending farther west, which
keeps unusually warm temperatures out of the region for most of the period.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 10% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 65% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 1=
0%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to excellent model agreement on most features, though there is uncertai=
nty
how features in the eastern CONUS will evolve.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 28, 2021 - JAN 03, 2022

Week-2 looks very similar to the 6-10 day period. Good model agreement on m=
ost
features, which are expected to remain in place but may deamplify a bit tow=
ard
the end of the period, limiting weather extremes through the western Northe=
rn
Hemisphere at the time. But models continue to agree that a strong ridge in
the
North Pacific will remain in place with some decrease in strength, which
should
allow the trough in western North America to weaken as well, bringing reduc=
ed
precipitation to the western CONUS and allowing the extremely cold air in t=
he
northern Rockies and Plains to moderate. Strong ridging in the northern
latitudes is expected to persist while the flat ridge over the southeastern
CONUS slowly decays, reducing the northward extent of unusually warm weathe=
r.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's GFS
Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble
Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 5 out of 5=
,
due to unusually strong model agreement, especially this far in advance.


FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...Pattern Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show an impressively strong and persistent
ridge over and north of the East-Central Pacific helping to hold
an amplified upper trough in place over or slightly inland from
the West Coast.  This upper trough will support an extended period
of precipitation and mostly below normal high temperatures over a
broad portion of the West.  The trough's shape will vary from day
to day depending on individual shortwaves digging into the trough,
and features ejecting from the trough will periodically support
waves/systems to the east of the Rockies.  Associated fronts will
separate a pronounced temperature contrast, between well above
normal readings over and east of the southern two-thirds of the
Plains and much below normal temperatures becoming established
over the far northern Plains.

The primary forecast problems involve the specifics of individual
shortwaves within the western trough and then over eastern U.S.
how a conflict of large scale pattern teleconnections gets
resolved with respect to ejecting features--namely the
Pacific/western U.S. pattern favoring above normal upper heights
over the East versus the ridging/positive height anomalies
northeast of Hudson Bay favoring moderately below normal eastern
U.S. heights.

As for the first system of interest, there has been decent
agreement in principle that fast-moving shortwave energy emerging
over the Rockies/Plains early Friday will support a Plains-Midwest
through Northeast system Friday and Christmas Day/Saturday.
Guidance has had some difficulty in resolving the details due in
part to the blocky nature of flow over eastern Canada.  New 00Z
runs had showed some added improvement in clustering for
specifics, but the ECMWF has changed considerably with shortwave
details near the West Coast--ultimately leading to a major
continuity change farther east.

Attention then turns to the next bundle of energy amplifying near
the West Coast around the end of the week and separate shortwave
energy lingering offshore to the south (lingering energy from an
upper low now over the eastern Pacific).  The northern stream
shortwave has reasonable agreement but there are important detail
differences with the southern energy--leading to significant
issues for the precipitation forecast over the southwestern U.S.
The combination of these features should progress across the West
and then support one or more surface lows/fronts from the Plains
eastward Sunday onward.  By Monday-Tuesday individual model runs
and ensemble members increasingly diverge for details at the
surface and aloft east of the Rockies, perhaps reflecting the
competing teleconnection tendencies over the East.  These
differences, as well as decreasing confidence for details within
the western trough late in the period, favor trending the initial
12Z/18Z operational model blend used early in the forecast toward
at least two-thirds weight of the ensemble means (18Z GEFS and 12Z
ECens/CMCens) by day 7 Tuesday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Shortwaves digging into the persistent upper trough aligned near
the West Coast will periodically enhance the flow of moisture into
the West, with areas of focused/terrain-enhanced precipitation
extending from the coast into the Rockies.  Expect episodes of
moderate to heavy precipitation from the Cascades and coastal
areas of the Pacific Northwest into California, which will
increase the soil saturation and sensitivity to local runoff.
However during the extended time frame uncertainty on timing and
interactions of shortwaves will temper confidence in resolving the
exact location and intensity of lower elevation rainfall with
respect to local runoff/flooding issues.  Highest
precipitation/liquid equivalents should extend from the Oregon
Cascades into northwest California and the Sierra Nevada.
Meaningful precipitation will also be likely across the highest
terrain of the Great Basin and the central/northern Rockies.
Areas from southern California through Arizona and the southern
Great Basin/south-central Rockies may also see a period of
enhanced precipitation late this week and/or into the weekend but
specifics are very sensitive to upper flow details for which
models do not yet agree.  Colder air filtering into the Northwest
may lead to very low snow levels by next Sunday-Tuesday while
other parts of the West may also see declining snow levels as the
upper trough axis nudges eastward.

An area of precipitation will accompany a system crossing the
northeastern quadrant of the lower 48 Friday into Christmas
Day/Saturday.  The best potential for wintry weather will extend
from the Upper Great Lakes into New England.  Another area of
precipitation may spread across northern tier areas and parts of
the East Sunday onward.  Details of this precip area are still
ambiguous though once again any wintry weather should be confined
to northern latitudes.

The southern half of the Plains will be at the center of the
greatest warm temperature anomalies during the period with decent
coverage of max/min readings 20-30F above normal.  Such
temperatures may challenge daily records.  Some of this warmth
will extend farther northeast/east as determined by system/front
progression and position.  Anomalies should become somewhat more
suppressed and less extreme by next Tuesday.  Meanwhile
temperatures of 20-40F below normal will settle over the extreme
northern Plains (primarily Montana and North Dakota) from the
weekend onward.  Some gradual broadening of the western upper
trough should bring a gradual cooling trend to the region with
some highs 10F or more below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0157 AM CST Tue Dec 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level shortwave trough will move through the
northwesterly flow across the northern Plains today. As this trough
crosses the Rocky Mountains, lee cyclogenesis is anticipated with a
surface cyclone moving south along the Front Range through the day.
In addition, this passing trough will lead to some strong downslope
flow in the lee of the mountains.

...Southeast Wyoming, far northern Colorado, and portions of the
Nebraska Panhandle...
Strong sustained winds of 25 to 30 mph are expected during the
afternoon across a small portion of the central High Plains as a
result of strengthening downslope flow. Temperatures will be cool in
the region and minimum relative humidity is only expected to drop to
20 to 25 percent for a few hours. In addition, fuels in this region
are dry, but drier fuels are mostly south of this region. Therefore,
an elevated delineation is justified, but marginal temperatures,
relative humidity, and fuels preclude a critical area.

...Eastern New Mexico into far West Texas...
As the lee cyclone moves south along the Front Range, the pressure
gradient will tighten across the southern High Plains. This will
lead to wind speeds increasing to 15 to 20 mph in a very dry airmass
with relative humidity mostly in the single digits.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CST Tue Dec 21 2021

Valid 221200Z - 231200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough will cross the central Rockies on Wednesday,
leading to moderately strong lee cyclogenesis. As the surface
pressure gradient tightens, gusty winds are expected across portions
of the southern and central High Plains.

...Southeast Wyoming, far northern Colorado, and far southwest
Nebraska...
As the surface low strengthens and moves into the central Plains,
strong downslope flow is expected to develop in its wake across
southeast Wyoming and into the Nebraska Panhandle and far northern
Colorado. Wind speeds of 25 to 30 mph are anticipated with relative
humidity around 8 to 12 percent.

...Eastern New Mexico into far West Texas...
Westerly winds are expected to strengthen to around 15 to 20 mph
during the afternoon hours with relative humidity around 8 to 12
percent. Some stronger winds may occur late in the afternoon,
especially in western portions of the elevated area as mid-level
flow strengthens between 21 and 00Z.

...Low pressure system expected to bring locally heavy
rain/thunderstorms across Florida and the Southeast coast today...

...Another low pressure will spread snow across the northern tier
states today and then a quick round of snow for Maine on
Thursday...

...Unsettled weather spreads farther south from the Pacific
Northwest into California as well as farther inland across the
northern Rockies...

A low pressure system moving through the Gulf of Mexico is
forecast to make landfall and traverse the Florida Peninsula this
afternoon.  This system has been ingesting plenty of moisture from
the Gulf water and is forecast to bring a quick round of moderate
to heavy rain across northern Florida today.  To the south of the
low track, thunderstorms ahead of a cold front could become severe
this morning.  Some of the heavy rain and thunderstorms may result
in instances of flash flooding.  In addition, a period of gusty
winds can be expected as the low center moves over the Florida
Peninsula this afternoon.  The heavy rain and severe weather
threat will quickly diminish this evening for all of Florida as
the low moves out into the Atlantic.  On the other hand, some of
the heavier rainfall will brush the Southeast U.S. coastal areas
tonight into Wednesday morning as the low turns northeastward and
tracks along the Gulf Stream.  The low pressure system should
track far enough offshore Wednesday night to allow fine to return
to the East Coast.  Colder air will then overspread the entire
eastern U.S. into Thursday behind a reinforcing cold front and as
a high pressure system takes over.

Meanwhile, another clipper type low pressure system is expected to
bring a quick round light to moderate snow across the northern
tier states today.  The warmer waters of upper Great Lakes should
help deliver somewhat higher snowfall amounts on the lee side of
the lakes.  By later today, some wintry weather is expected to
develop in Maine ahead of this low and should continue into
tonight.

Elsewhere, the aforementioned upper-level shortwave is currently
found across the Northwest and responsible for light-to-moderate
snow extending into the Northern Rockies tonight. This area of
light snow will race across the Northern Plains and into the Upper
Midwest by Tuesday morning, where a few inches of accumulating
snow is possible. Parts of the Upper Great Lakes will also enjoy
some festive snowfall on Tuesday and Tuesday night. For the
immediate western U.S. coastline, continuous onshore flow will
allow for unsettled weather on Tuesday until the next system
approaches on Wednesday. Heavy snow is possible across the Cascade
Mountains and Sierra Nevada, as well as periods of
moderate-to-heavy rain along the northern California and Oregon
coast.

For much of the central U.S., dry and mild weather is in store
through midweek as below average and bitterly cold temperatures
remain confined to the Northern Plains.

front before a surge of moisture reaches the Pacific Northwest
tonight ahead of a low pressure wave digging down the west coast
of Canada.  Snow will once again become heavy over the mountains
as rain will become heavy near the coast and lower elevations
later on Wednesday and into Thursday morning.  The precipiation
will also become progressively more widespread further south into
California and into the Sierra Nevada.  The moisture will also
work its way inland and bring mixed precipitation across the Great
Basin and mountain snows for the northern Rockies during the next
couple of days.

For much of the central U.S., dry and mild weather is in store
through midweek as below average temperatures remain confined to
the Northern Plains.  Parts of the High Plains will begin to see
an increasing risk of fire weather where dry conditions are
forecast to persist.

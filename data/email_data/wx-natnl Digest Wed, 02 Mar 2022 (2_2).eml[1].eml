Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0157 AM CST Wed Mar 02 2022

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging will gradually breakdown across the western
CONUS, as increasing cyclonic flow begins to overspread the
Intermountain West ahead of an approaching large-scale trough. At
the surface, high pressure will infiltrate the northern Plains and
Upper MS Valley, while lee troughing begins to develop over the High
Plains.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
In response to the developing lee trough over the High Plains,
southerly sustained surface winds of 15 mph will develop amid 5-15
percent RH during the afternoon hours. This will result in elevated
fire-weather conditions, with spotty critical conditions possible.

...Southwest...
Dry and breezy conditions will be possible ahead of the approaching
large-scale trough, though the lack of a tighter surface pressure
gradient casts uncertainty on the fire-weather threat. Therefore,
highlights will not be added at this time, though trends will be
monitored closely.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry/breezy post-frontal air mass will be in place over portions of
the Mid-Atlantic, potentially resulting in locally elevated
fire-weather conditions across areas that have not received
substantial precipitation over the last week. However, these
conditions look too marginal and localized for any highlights.

...Rain/snow across the Pacific Northwest slowly wanes as
increasingly unsettled weather works its way into California by
Friday morning...

...Above normal temperatures from parts of the West expanding to
the eastern U.S. will be contrasted with arctic air and periods of
light snow across the northern tier...

Over the next couple of days, an arctic air mass engulfing much of
Canada is forecast to gradually filter southward into the northern
and northeastern U.S. while a developing low pressure system will
likely shift the unsettled weather southward from the Pacific
Northwest into California by Friday morning.  In the mean time,
rain will be heaviest today across western Oregon as a weakening
low pressure system offshore will continue to direct moisture
toward the coast.  Lighter precipitation is expected to persist
farther north across Washington today as the core of moisture
plume penetrates further inland through northern Idaho and
northwestern Montana where wet snow is forecast to be heaviest
near the arctic frontal boundary in the mountainous terrain.
Farther east, periods of light snow are expected across the
northern Plains, Great Lakes, and the Northeast through the next
couple of days as fast-moving low pressure waves form along the
arctic front and moves rapidly toward the east.  Up to 6 inches of
snow is forecast near the Canadian border of the northern High
Plains as well as areas downwind from the lower Great Lakes
through Friday morning.

In contrast with the wintry conditions across the norther tier,
Spring-like temperatures are in store for the central Plains today
as afternoon temperatures are forecast to climb well up into the
70s, which are nearly 30 above normal for early March.  A few
daily high temperature records could be established.  The
aforementioned arctic air mass will work further south into the
central Plains on Thursday.  Meanwhile, a cold upper trough off
the West Coast is forecast to approach California.  This system
will bring increasingly unsettled weather into California with
colder temperatures by Friday morning as a low pressure is
forecast to develop.

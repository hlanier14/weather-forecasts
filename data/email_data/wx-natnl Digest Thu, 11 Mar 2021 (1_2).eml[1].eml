Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1046 AM CST Wed Mar 10 2021

Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

The previous forecast remains largely on track. The northern bounds
of the Elevated/Critical areas have been trimmed slightly southward
to account for cold frontal position (noted via latest METAR
observations). While some boundary-layer mixing may continue within
the post cold-frontal environment, the overall cooler temperatures
and higher surface RH should limit the more robust fire-spread
potential to a degree in northwest Kansas. However, the Elevated
area has been expanded northeastward across portions of northeast
Kansas into extreme southeast Nebraska/southwest Iowa. A narrow
corridor of drier surface air (based on latest METAR observations
and model guidance consensus) is expected to mix northeast, aided by
clear skies and strong diurnal heating.

Farther southwest, across the central and southern High Plains,
latest METAR observations show sustained 20-30 mph westerly surface
winds, with gusts up to 40 mph. Surface RH has already dropped to
15-30%, and clear afternoon skies are expected to contribute to
mixing down much drier air aloft (as seen in the 12Z AMA observed
sounding), with widespread 10-15% RH expected by afternoon peak
heating. Some spots may even see single-digit RH values, and given
the sustained 25-30 mph surface winds/higher gusts, widespread
high-end Critical conditions are expected through the afternoon
hours.

Dry surface air (25-40% RH) is expected during the afternoon across
portions of the central Appalachians to the Carolina Piedmont
region. However, the lack of stronger surface winds and modestly
receptive fuels are expected to mainly support localized
wildfire-spread concerns.

..Squitieri.. 03/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0108 AM CST Wed Mar 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
An broad upper-level trough continues to move onshore across the
West Coast as a leading shortwave impulse propagates to the
northeast out of the Four-Corners region within a mean southwesterly
flow regime. A surface low noted over east CO/west KS will deepen as
it translates northeast with the shortwave trough through the day.
As a result, a trailing lee trough/dryline will migrate east as
well, allowing for a broad swath of west/southwesterly flow across
the southern High Plains this afternoon. Downslope winds off the
southern Rockies along with strong flow aloft will support dry,
windy conditions and a widespread fire weather threat from southern
New Mexico to central Kansas.

...Southern New Mexico and the southern High Plains...
The forecast remains on track with widespread elevated to critical
conditions likely for several hours this afternoon. Recent fuel
analyses continue to show receptive fine fuels in place with 10-hour
fuel moisture values generally between 4-8%. Observed surface trends
show dewpoints have fallen across southern/eastern NM over the past
12-24 hours. Regional 00 UTC soundings also reveal dry conditions
with deep, well-mixed boundary layers under a mid-level dry slot
(per recent water-vapor imagery).

These observed trends support the forecast and the potential for
widespread relative humidity values below 15%. Mostly clear skies
today will allow for ample diurnal warming and deep boundary-layer
mixing by late afternoon. Downward transport of stronger mid-level
flow within this layer will support wind gusts up to 35-45 mph amid
sustained winds between 20-30 mph. While widespread humidity values
in the 10-15% range with winds between 20-25 mph appear to be the
most likely scenario across much of the critical area, more
aggressive solutions show the potential for brief extremely critical
meteorological conditions across southern to eastern NM with RH near
5% and sustained winds around 30 mph. However, these conditions are
not expected to be widespread or persistent. Guidance has come into
somewhat better agreement regarding the potential for elevated
conditions as far northeast as central KS, and some solutions
suggest elevated wind/RH combinations may reach into far southwest
IA/southeast NE (though confidence in this potential is low).

...Western Carolinas/Virginia...
Dry conditions are expected once again this afternoon with RH values
falling to near 20%. The eastward shift of the surface high will
allow for weak moisture advection into the region through the day.
However,southwesterly winds increasing to around 10-15 mph may
overlap with diurnal humidity minimums and support brief/localized
elevated fire weather conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 10 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low pressure is likely to promote below normal
temperatures
and elevate chances for hazardous cold across portions of the Rockies, and the
Central and Southern Plains during early week-2. A surface low may trigger
heavy precipitation over parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of
the
lower-48. Over Alaska, colder than average conditions are possible over
portions of the western and southern Mainland during week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Rockies, and
the
Central and Southern Plains, Thu-Fri, Mar 18-19.

Flooding possible for portions of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio River
Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 13 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 17:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!t9iweDSKup-9zmHkxUEZ1kIR0JRLivi9bJqJyzsvlKC1-hWkJcKe18nmULR7F0wiQlwNzsMk$

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 18 - WEDNESDAY MARCH 24: By the start of week-2, the GEFS
and ECMWF both depict a mid-level trough that weakens and lifts out over the
Mississippi Valley, which is anticipated to alleviate the risk of much below
normal temperatures forecast across portions of the Great Plains and Rockies.
However, there are differences between this morning's GEFS and ECMWF in the
evolution of the mid-level height anomalies, particularly over the eastern
Pacific and western CONUS during early week-2. The 0z and 6z GEFS continue to
favor anomalous troughing centered over the Gulf of Alaska, with negative
height departures overspreading portions of the Pacific Northwest and into
California. The 0z ECMWF depicts a more westward placed mid-level trough over
the eastern Pacific, while favoring the development of anomalous ridging
centered over the southwestern CONUS. Given these differences in the models,
there is increased uncertainty in regards to the risk of heavy precipitation
over the West Coast, as well as hazardous precipitation potential downstream
across the CONUS.



Over the Rockies and High Plains, both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
depict less spatial coverage of elevated probabilities (>20%) of minimum
temperatures falling below the 15th percentile and below freezing relative to
yesterday's reforecast guidance. The highest probabilities for these
anomalously cold temperatures in the reforecast tool guidance are localized to
eastern Colorado, where forecast heavy snowfall and increased snow cover
during
week-1 is likely to help sustain below-normal temperatures into the week-2
outlook period. However, negative temperature departures in the raw ensemble
means are considerably weaker early in the period compared to previous
guidance. As a result, the slight risk of much below normal temperatures
remains issued for much of the Rockies and the Plains from Mar 18 to 19, and
the moderate risk area has been removed in today's outlook. Temperatures are
expected to moderate as the anomalous troughing aloft is anticipated to
weaken.



Multiple models continue to advertise surface low pressure tracking across the
eastern CONUS during early week-2. However, there continues to be significant
ensemble spread of the surface low track and strength. While the ECMWF
ensemble
mean precipitation and reforecast tool favor some heavy precipitation
potential
across the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic associated with this low early in the
period, lower precipitation amounts are seen in the 0z and 6z GEFS ensemble
means compared to previous guidance in addition to today's GEFS reforecast
tool
no longer supporting this risk. As a result, there is insufficient confidence
in rainfall amounts exceeding hazardous thresholds, resulting in the removal
of
the slight risk for heavy precipitation. Over the Middle Mississippi and Ohio
Valleys, river flooding continues to be a concern, as precipitation is
forecast
to be well above-normal over the lower Midwest during week-1. Although there
is
a slight tilt in the odds for below-normal rainfall across this region during
week-2, any increase in precipitation may exacerbate river levels and a
possible flooding area is issued for the region.



Farther west, the aforementioned anomalous troughing over the eastern Pacific,
and associated onshore flow featured in the 0z and 6z GEFS favors increased
chances for above-normal precipitation over the Pacific Northwest and parts of
California. The GEFS reforecast tool continues to indicate an elevated risk
for
heavy precipitation across northern California with at least a 20% chance of
3-day precipitation accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch
during the early to mid portion of week-2. However, the ECMWF reforecast tool
remains unsupportive of this risk. Due to continued disagreement regarding the
heavy precipitation potential over this region in the guidance and tools, no
related hazards are posted in today's outlook but will continue to be
monitored
in upcoming outlooks.



Over Alaska, there is continued disagreement between the GEFS and the ECMWF of
the 500-hPa height anomalies as well as the reforecast tools' potential for
hazardous temperatures. While the GEFS favors anomalous cold across portions
of
the western and southern Mainland, tied to anomalous troughing aloft, there is
still insufficient confidence to post any related hazards at this time.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

During the short range period, a deep upper low is forecast to
split off from northern stream flow and become a potent cutoff low
moving across the Four Corners region to Southern Plains over the
weekend. This plus a surface low over the Central Plains will
spread significant snow to the Central Rockies and central High
Plains Friday through Sunday, while severe weather and heavy rain
are possible across the south-central CONUS. Another trough and
additional energy should come into the West around Mon and serve
as a kicker for the initial closed low, pushing it eastward as it
weakens. This second trough is expected to make its way into the
central U.S. by midweek.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble guidance is in generally good agreement with
the overall pattern described above through the weekend. GFS runs
appear a little fast/east with the upper low track and its surface
frontal system compared to consensus, but now within reasonable
spread for the medium range period, as more recent runs have
slowed closer to the consensus. A multi-model deterministic blend
of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and a small portion of the 06Z GFS was
able to be used for the first part of the period. By Mon,
troughing coming into the West seems generally well clustered
though with some small-scale differences, with the exception of
the 00Z UKMET. The UKMET shows less and faster-moving energy in
the West, allowing for the initial closed low to settle south of
other guidance and maintain its strength longer, becoming an
outlier solution. By Tue/Wed, notable differences arise with the
initial upper low weakening and ejecting out as the upstream low
tracks eastward, leading to more uncertainty. The 06Z GEFS mean
and 00Z EC mean were more favored for the later part of the period
to minimize the differences in individual models.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow accumulating over a foot along with gusty
winds creating low visibility and possible blizzard conditions are
forecast across the Central Rockies and central portions of the
High Plains from Friday (short range) into the weekend. Farther
east in the warm sector, heavy rains/convection will also develop
in earnest from the south-central Plains to the mid-Mississippi
Valley where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the Gulf of
Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal zone.
SPC shows a severe weather threat for the southern Plains to the
mid-lower Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector.

Rounds of rainfall are possible across the southeastern U.S.
through the period as well, though the details are highly
uncertain at this point. Above average temperatures there should
transition closer to normal by Wed. The potential for any wintry
weather on the northern side across the north-central Appalachians
and northern Mid-Atlantic on the northern edge of any
precipitation shield is also quite uncertain. The the upstream
kicker system for the West has potential to produce generally
modest precipitation from the Northwest/Northern California and to
a lesser extent southeastward across and Great Basin.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...

The Critical area across eastern New Mexico has been expanded
northward and southwestward across central portions of the state.
While fuels across the higher terrain remain marginally receptive to
fire spread, fuels across lower-terrain areas have dried
sufficiently to support relatively greater wildfire growth
potential. Latest guidance shows 10-15% RH coinciding with 20+ mph
sustained southwesterly surface winds for several hours during the
afternoon across central New Mexico, warranting the Critical
expansion.

An Elevated area was added for parts of the Mid Atlantic, as 25-40%
surface RH coinciding with sustained 10-15 mph surface southwesterly
winds are expected during the afternoon based on latest guidance
consensus. In addition, current METAR observations depict 15-25% RH
across portions of central Virginia into Maryland, with 12Z RNK/IAD
observed soundings showing very dry air aloft. Given relatively weak
large-scale deep-layer flow expected now through noon tomorrow, this
dry airmass is expected to remain in place. As such, RH may be lower
than forecast by guidance. Also, 10- and 100-hr fuels across the
region are becoming quite receptive to wildfire spread, with above
average to (in a couple cases) near critically high ERCs noted,
further warranting an Elevated delineation.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0210 AM CST Wed Mar 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
The southwesterly flow regime over the Southwest will persist into
Thursday as the main trough axis shifts southward along the CA
coast. The lack of any notable upper-level features embedded within
the mean flow will limit the potential for strong surface pressure
falls in the lee of the Rockies, though sufficient zonal flow aloft
over the terrain will support modest lee troughing. This suggests
that windy conditions will be more regional in nature (as compared
to Wednesday). Windy conditions and an associated fire weather
threat appear most likely for the southeast quadrant of New Mexico
into the western TX Panhandle where dry/windy conditions have been
common over the past several days.

...Southeast New Mexico...
Dry conditions appear likely across much of the southern High Plains
for Thursday afternoon with relative humidity values in the 10-20%
range likely over southeast NM and the western TX Panhandle.
Mid-level flow is forecast to be weaker compared to Wednesday and
will most likely be focused across south-central to eastern NM per
recent deterministic and ensemble guidance. Diurnal heating should
allow for sufficient mixing to capitalize on this stronger flow and
support 25-35 mph wind gusts, though increasing clouds through the
day may hinder this potential. While elevated wind/RH combinations
will likely be met from south-central NM to the NM/CO/Panhandles
region, critical conditions appear most likely for portions of
southeast NM in the vicinity and downwind of the Guadalupe,
Sacramento, and Sandia Manzano mountains where the overlap of the
dry conditions, clear skies, and stronger mid-level winds appears
most likely.

...A major weekend snowstorm for the Central Rockies/High Plains
and a heavy rainfall threat from the south-central Plains to the
mid-Mississippi Valley...

...Overview...

During the short range period, a deep upper low is forecast to
split off from northern stream flow and become a potent cutoff low
moving across the Four Corners region to Southern Plains over the
weekend. This plus a surface low over the Central Plains will
spread significant snow to the Central Rockies and central High
Plains Friday through Sunday, while severe weather and heavy rain
are possible across the south-central CONUS. Another trough and
additional energy should come into the West around Mon and serve
as a kicker for the initial closed low, pushing it eastward as it
weakens. This second trough is expected to make its way into the
central U.S. by midweek.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Model and ensemble guidance is in generally good agreement with
the overall pattern described above through the weekend. GFS runs
appear a little fast/east with the upper low track and its surface
frontal system compared to consensus, but now within reasonable
spread for the medium range period, as more recent runs have
slowed closer to the consensus. A multi-model deterministic blend
of the 00Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC and a small portion of the 06Z GFS was
able to be used for the first part of the period. By Mon,
troughing coming into the West seems generally well clustered
though with some small-scale differences, with the exception of
the 00Z UKMET. The UKMET shows less and faster-moving energy in
the West, allowing for the initial closed low to settle south of
other guidance and maintain its strength longer, becoming an
outlier solution. By Tue/Wed, notable differences arise with the
initial upper low weakening and ejecting out as the upstream low
tracks eastward, leading to more uncertainty. The 06Z GEFS mean
and 00Z EC mean were more favored for the later part of the period
to minimize the differences in individual models.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Significant heavy snow accumulating over a foot along with gusty
winds creating low visibility and possible blizzard conditions are
forecast across the Central Rockies and central portions of the
High Plains from Friday (short range) into the weekend. Much lower
snow amounts may then spread into the Upper Midwest. Farther east
in the warm sector, heavy rains/convection will also develop in
earnest from the south-central Plains to the mid-Mississippi
Valley where increasingly deep moisture inflow from the Gulf of
Mexico will wrap around the low into a slow-moving frontal zone.
SPC shows a severe weather threat for the Southern Plains to the
mid-lower Mississippi Valley unstable warm sector.

Rounds of rainfall are possible across the southeastern U.S.
through the period as well, though the details are highly
uncertain at this point. Above average temperatures there and over
the north-central U.S. should transition closer to normal by Wed.
The potential for any wintry weather on the northern side across
the north-central Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic on the
northern edge of a precipitation shield is also quite uncertain.
Additionally, the upstream kicker system for the West has
potential to produce generally modest precipitation from the
Northwest/Northern California and to a lesser extent eastward
across the Great Basin and Rockies.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Wed March 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 16 - 20 2021

Today's model forecasts are in fair agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across most of North America during the 6-10 day period. The ensemble
mean solutions from the GEFS, Canadian, and ECMWF model suites depict an
amplified mean trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies over
the
Polar region north of Siberia. Farther to the south, anomalous ridging is
forecast over the Bering Sea, leading to anticipated above normal heights
across the Aleutians and parts of western Mainland Alaska. Downstream,
troughing with below normal heights is predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Over
the CONUS, a southern stream trough is predicted over much of the CONUS,
resulting in anticipated below normal heights extending from most of the
western CONUS eastward to the Middle Mississippi Valley. Ridging and above
normal heights are expected over much of the Southeast and coastal
Mid-Atlantic.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures in much of the High Plains
and central CONUS are associated with mean cyclonic flow and near to below
normal mid-level heights, with the highest (60%) probability over the parts of
central High Plains and central Rockies. Enhanced probabilities of above
normal
temperatures are favored across much of the eastern CONUS and the Great Lakes,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal temperatures are
favored for parts of northern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the dynamical
reforecast tools.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for parts of northern Mainland
Alaska, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Odds also tilt toward
above normal precipitation for parts of the northwestern CONUS and Central
Plains, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Below normal
precipitation is favored for much of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi
Valley, Southwest, and parts of the Southern Plains, also consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Mean troughing centered over the east-central
CONUS and associated shortwaves, as well as the potential for enhanced
moisture
advection from the Gulf of Mexico increase probabilities of above normal
precipitation across much of the eastern CONUS.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to fair
model agreement on an amplified pattern across much of North America, offset
by
differences among the dynamical precipitation and temperature outlook tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 18 - 24 2021

During the week-2 period, a transitional period is likely as the overall
pattern is forecast to de-amplify and model uncertainty increases. The most
anomalous features predicted by the models across the Northern Hemisphere
include a ridge over the North Pacific and troughing over the Gulf of Alaska.
The week-2 official 500-hPa height blend depicts near to below normal heights
across much of the north-central CONUS. Weak cyclonic flow is forecast near
the
Great Lakes, and ridging is anticipated farther east along the East Coast.
Above normal heights are anticipated across much of western Mainland Alaska
and
the Aleutians.

Onshore flow and weak ridging favor above normal temperature over most of the
western CONUS. Persistent negative height anomalies anticipated over parts of
the central CONUS favor enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures
for
much of the Central High Plains. Conversely, ridging and southerly surface
flow
enhance odds of above normal temperatures across much of the eastern CONUS and
parts of the Northern Plains. Low level easterly flow from western Canada
favors below normal temperatures for southern Mainland Alaska and Aleutians.

Above normal precipitation is likely with predicted mean onshore flow for the
Pacific Northwest. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for the
remainder of the western and central CONUS, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for the Florida
Peninsula along with parts of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, supported by
dynamical forecast tools. Below normal precipitation is likely for most of
Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, fair
agreement among the forecast tools, offset by the uncertainty across much of
the forecast domain.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Heavy snow likely for parts of the Upper Midwest through
Thursday morning...

...Potential for severe weather over parts of the Central Plains
and Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley...

...Flash and urban flooding possible from the Central Plains to
the Ohio Valley...

...Critical risk of fire weather in the Southern Plains and
Southwest...

...Temperatures throughout the eastern U.S. will be up to 20
degrees above normal Thursday and Friday...

A low pressure system with a frontal boundary extending from the
Southwest to the Upper Great Lakes is forecast to slowly propagate
northeast over the next couple of days. To the north and east of
the primary low pressure center, cold temperatures and shortwave
energy will work in tandem to generate moderate to heavy snow from
the Northern Plains to the Upper Midwest. While northeast
Minnesota will likely receive the highest snowfall totals of 6 to
8 inches, widespread accumulations of 2 to 4 inches are possible
across the affected areas. As such, Winter Storm Warnings and
Advisories are in effect primarily in South Dakota and Minnesota
until tomorrow morning. In Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Michigan
Upper Peninsula freezing rain is also likely to develop due to
rain changing over to snow as temperatures drop through the
evening hours.

Showers and thunderstorms will persist along the leading edge of
the frontal boundary through Friday evening and could become
severe at times. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk for severe thunderstorms for portions of the Central Plains
and Mississippi Valley through tomorrow morning. The threat for
severe weather will continue throughout the period, with the
primary region of concern tomorrow being an area extending from
northeastern Oklahoma to southern Illinois, while northern Texas,
central Oklahoma, southern Kansas, and southwestern Missouri will
be at greatest risk on Friday. These thunderstorms will also have
the potential to cause flash and urban flooding due to their slow
motion and high rain rates. At present, a Marginal Risk for
flooding has been issued for portions of Northern Wisconsin and
the Michigan Upper Peninsula. The risk for flash flooding will be
carried throughout the period as the system is expected to move
very slowly through the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys
tomorrow and subsequently stall over the Southern Plains on Friday.

Over the Southwest and Southern Plains persistent dry conditions,
exacerbated by a passing cold front Wednesday evening, combined
with high winds associated with the frontal passage and a tight
pressure gradient nearby will create a critical risk of fire
weather throughout the period. Portions of southeast New Mexico,
the Texas Panhandle, northwest Oklahoma, southwest Kansas, and
southeast Colorado will be at greatest risk for fire weather and
currently have Red Flag Warnings in effect.

Elsewhere, short wave energy associated with a low pressure center
positioned off the West Coast will provide the impetus for showers
and thunderstorms along the coast and high elevation snow into
tomorrow morning. Further inland, a second low pressure center
will drive the development of snow throughout the Central Great
Basin as well as the central and southern Rockies. The combination
of these two low pressure centers into one system on Thursday
afternoon will help prolong showers and thunderstorms in the
Southwest and snow in the Intermountain West and central/southern
Rockies into Friday. Over the eastern U.S. mild temperatures are
expected on Thursday and Friday, with high temperatures across the
region sitting reaching into 60s and 70s. The greatest departures
from normal will be felt over the Midwest and Northeast, where
high temperatures will be on average 10 to 20 degrees warmer than
normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1247 AM CST Thu Mar 11 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR CENTRAL TO SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A broad longwave upper-level trough remains largely in place across
the West Coast with a belt of stronger flow extending from northern
Baja California into the southern High Plains and portions of the
Midwest. This pattern is expected to hold through the day today, and
the persistent nearly zonal flow over the southern Rockies, along
with weak mid/upper-level diffluence, will help support modest
surface pressure falls over central/eastern New Mexico today. The
low-level mass response coupled with antecedent dry conditions will
support another day of fire weather concerns.

...New Mexico...
The forecast remains on track with widespread elevated to critical
fire weather conditions likely across New Mexico and adjacent areas
of southeast AZ, west TX, and far southeast CO later today. The main
change compared to previous outlooks was a reduction in the risk
area across west TX (where modest moisture return is ongoing) and
the OK/TX Panhandles where cooler post-frontal air will limit RH
reductions this afternoon.

To the west, recent observations across NM show dewpoint values in
the single digits to low teens, which will support another day of
widespread RH values in the 5-10% range west of the surface
trough/stalled cold front. Modest surface pressure falls will limit
the spatial extent of windy conditions compared to Wednesday, but
sustained 15-25 mph winds appear likely across the risk area per
recent ensemble guidance. A corridor of stronger mid-level flow
should exist from southwest to central NM, and given deep afternoon
boundary-layer mixing and terrain enhancements, will support wind
gusts between 30-40 mph. Fuels across eastern and southern portions
of NM remain receptive after several days of dry and windy
conditions. Further north, fuels within the higher elevations are
only modestly receptive, but recent reports suggest low-elevation
fuels are receptive and will support a fire weather concern.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry conditions persist across the western Carolinas and into the
Mid-Atlantic region after relative humidity values fell into the
teens for several locations yesterday. Recent fuel analyses suggest
that 10/100-hour fuel moisture values have fallen to near 5 and 10%,
respectively. Although winds have become more southerly with the
eastward translation of a surface high, moisture return into the
region will be minimal today based on upstream dewpoints across the
western Carolinas in the low to mid 30s. Meager moisture return
coupled with diurnal heating should yield RH values in the 20-30%
range for today. The approach of a surface trough/cold front from
the west will augment pressure-gradient winds this afternoon. Winds
between 10-15 mph appear most likely and will support elevated fire
weather conditions for most locations in the risk area. Frequent
wind gusts near 20 mph are possible and may support localized/brief
critical conditions.

...Western Heat Persists This Week and Spreads into the Northern
Plains...
...Midwest Heavy Rainfall Threat to Redevelop Midweek...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Yet another significant heat wave now underway over the West under
upper ridging will continue from the Great Basin to CA and the
Southwest with temperatures 10-15F above normal into midweek. This
will produce some daily temperature records. Guidance consensus is
leading to gradually lowering heights with a developing modest
northwest US trough, with the highest heights shifting south into
southern CA/AZ. There is potential for rebuilding heights over the
Great Basin to the central Rockies and northern Plains as a closed
low persists off the west coast of Canada next weekend. Above
normal temperatures are expected across much of the northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies/High Plains next Fri 16 July- Sun 18
July, with cluster of high temperatures reaching 10-15 degrees
above normal next weekend.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may also support above normal temperatures this week
from the Mid-Atlantic to the lower Great Lakes and into the
Northeast. This includes the Washington, DC to Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York City corridor. Over next weekend, the
upper trough drifts east from the Lakes toward the northeast,
driving a cold front across the region. This increases
shower/storm chances with the front, followed by post-frontal
cooling in the lower Lakes and then next Sunday 18 July into the
adjacent northern mid Atlantic/New England.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies this week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
This may lead to local downpour and terrain enhancing runoff
issues, extending from short range activity.

With a wave front in the Midwest to the central Plains, additional
rounds of heavy showers and storms are forecast near the
meandering front, instability and upwards of 1.75" precipitable
water values. The models have renewed rainfall maxima gradually
shifting from the Upper Midwest by midweek to adjacent portions of
the Mid-MS/OH Valleys late week with slow frontal progression. The
rain threat area drifts south next weekend down the plains, MS
Valley and from the OH Valley into the TN Valley, central-southern
Appalachians, and mid Atlantic.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance forecast spread and uncertainty remains below normal next
week with a main exception of shortwaves progressing through a
mean Midwest trough and whether a closed low develops within the
500 mb trough next weekend near the Lakes/adjacent Canada. The WPC
medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend of
best clustered guidance from the 06 UTC GFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian Days 3-5 (Wed-Fri) along with the 13 UTC
National Blend of Models. The compatible 00 UTC GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means were then mainly used day 6/7 (next weekend) versus
the models amid growing run to run variance. The WPC composites
maintain act to mitigate these slowly growing smaller scale
guidance differences consistent with predictability.

1136 AM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

The Elevated risk area across southeastern ID was expanded northward
to encompass the eastern slopes of the MT Rockies and adjacent
portions of the northern High Plains. Mid-morning satellite imagery
shows a weak shortwave trough moving across northern ID that will
bring somewhat stronger mid-level flow to western MT this afternoon.
20-30 mph winds within the lowest 2-3 km AGL were noted in regional
VWPs, and will likely mix down to the surface as boundary-layer
mixing increases this afternoon. Winds will become more westerly
through the day behind a weak front (currently moving southeastward
out of Canada), which will support some degree of downslope
warming/drying this afternoon. Elevated conditions are possible
within the higher terrain and across adjacent portions of the
northern High Plains (where RH values are already in the 20-30%
range). With sustained winds near 15-20 mph expected, any critical
winds (20+ mph) will likely be transient and localized. All other
areas remain on track (see previous discussion for details).

..Moore.. 07/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will persist across the West. Along the
periphery of the ridge, a shortwave trough will move into the
northern Rockies during the afternoon. A weak cold front will
accompany the trough within Montana. Strong heating will occur
within the Great Basin into the Pacific Northwest.

...Northern Nevada into southern Idaho...
Elevated fire weather is expected to occur during the afternoon and
early evening. Strong heating in the Great Basin will drive a
thermal pressure trough and enhanced Zephyr winds across northwest
Nevada. Mid-level winds will be modest in Nevada, but will be
greater in Idaho as the shortwave moves across the area. Both areas
are expected to see similar conditions where 15-20 mph winds will
overlap 10-20% RH.

...Southwest Montana...
Isolated thunderstorms are expected to develop along the higher
terrain as weak lift from the approaching shortwave trough moves in
during the early/mid afternoon. Storm coverage remains somewhat
uncertain, but lightning ignitions will remain efficient. In
surrounding areas, some locally elevated wind/RH combinations are
possible as the surface gradient increases along with mid-level
winds. Conditions may not be widespread, but several ongoing fires
will be affected by these dry and breezy conditions.

...Central Nevada...
Mid-level moisture will remain within the Southwest and extend in to
parts of the central Great Basin. Storm coverage may be quite low in
this region and storm motions will be rather slow. PWAT should be
sufficiently low to promote low-end potential for lightning over dry
fuels.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun July 11 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0215 PM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

The overall forecast remains on track with only an eastward
expansion of the isolated dry-thunderstorm risk area into central UT
needed. Although storm coverage is uncertain, most ensemble and
deterministic guidance show at least a weak convective signal on the
northern fringe of returning monsoonal moisture with PWAT values
between 0.3 and 0.5 inches. With dry fuels already in place, the
expansion was warranted. A few thunderstorms are also possible
Monday night across northern WA where fuels are dry. Slow storm
motions and PWAT values between 0.6 to 0.8 inches suggest a mixture
of wet/dry storms is likely, which - in conjunction with a limited
spatial area - precludes introducing any additional risk areas. For
additional forecast details see the previous discussion below.

..Moore.. 07/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0203 AM CDT Sun Jul 11 2021/

...Synopsis...
A continued pattern of upper-level ridging across much of the West
is expected on Monday. Another low-amplitude shortwave trough will
move into the Northwest and northern Rockies during the
afternoon/evening. Mid-level moisture will continue to slowly build
north and west into the Great Basin.

...Nevada and southwest Utah...
Dry and windy conditions are expected to continue during the
afternoon. Wind appear that they will be somewhat stronger than on
Sunday given a marginally stronger surface pressure gradient. Winds
of 15-20 mph along with 10-20% RH will occur across most of northern
Nevada. Thunderstorms will be possible again in central Nevada into
southwest Utah. Storm coverage will see a slight increase given
greater mid-level moisture. Storm speeds will be slower to the south
and faster to the north. A mixed wet/dry mode is expected. Dry fuels
will support additional lightning ignitions.

...Central/eastern Oregon...
With the stronger surface pressure gradient, areas of 15-20 mph are
possible during the afternoon east of the Cascades. With 15-20% RH,
some ongoing fires could be impacted by locally elevated conditions.
Confidence in these conditions being sustained for more than an hour
or two remains low.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for the Northeast, Midwest,
and the South...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. into Tuesday...

At the beginning of the short-range forecast period, a low
pressure center was located over the Middle Mississippi Valley and
will continue slowly to the north-northeast over the next couple
of days. A warm front extended east through the Ohio Valley and
into the Mid-Atlantic, with a cold front extending southwestward
through the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Southern Plains.
Unsettled weather is expected in the Northeast U.S. over the next
couple of days as the slow moving warm front advances northward
bringing anomalously high low level moisture (dewpoints in the low
to mid-70s). Widespread moderate to heavy rain with embedded
thunderstorms are likely. A slight risk for excessive rainfall is
in effect on Monday for southern New York and New England. It
appears the heaviest rainfall will be across central portions of
upstate New York east through southern Vermont and New Hampshire,
where some isolated amounts of 2 to 4 inch are possible through
Tuesday morning. A Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is also in
effect for portions of upstate New York east of Lake Ontario to
the Adirondacks on Tuesday, where isolated rain totals of up to 4
inches are also possible. This may lead to some potential flooding
and rises on area rivers, especially over river basins that have
received above average rainfall over the past several days.
Marginal Risks for excessive rainfall are in effect further west
ahead of the system and along the warm front from the Lower Great
Lakes south to the Ohio Valley for widespread rain of around 1-2
inches over the next couple of days.

Heavy rain and potential flooding is also possible from the
Southern Plains to the Southeast as the cold front progresses
slowly eastward, and at some points remains stationary.  A Slight
Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect for the the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys on Monday as mean flow roughly
parallel to the front may lead to repeated heavy rainfall over
some areas. Rain totals of 1-2 inches are possible with some
isolated amounts up to 4 inches.

Excessive heat will continue to make weather headlines across the
western third of the nation. A stubborn upper level high anchored
over the Desert Southwest is the primary factor in the ongoing
heat wave, but this is expected to slowly erode some going into
the beginning of the week. Highs in the 110s in the Desert
Southwest and central California Valleys today should dip back
down into the mid-100s for Monday and Tuesday. Widespread heat
will continue over the Great Basin, with  highs in the mid-100s
Sunday and the upper 90s to 100 Monday and Tuesday. However, even
this small relative cool down is of little relief over areas that
have seen long-term oppressive and above normal temperatures.
Excessive heat warnings remain in effect for a majority of
locations in the region through Tuesday. Relative above normal
temperatures look to hold on the longest over the Interior Pacific
Northwest, with highs in the upper 90s to 100 through the forecast
period.  It is also worth noting that overnight lows have also
been impressive with this heat wave, with lows failing to drop
below the lower 90s for portions of the Desert Southwest.

Some relief from the extreme heat may arrive in the form of
monsoonal showers and thunderstorms each day across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico which will increase in coverage and
intensity through the period. A Marginal Risk for excessive
rainfall is in effect on Monday with a Slight Risk in effect for
Tuesday. The greatest threat is heavy downpours with rain rates of
up to 2 inches per hour that may lead to the rapid onset of flash
flooding for arid locations where such rain rates are a more rare
event. In addition to the threat for flooding, severe weather is
also possible. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk for severe thunderstorms today for the threat of high winds
and hail, with a Marginal Risk in effect for Monday.

Elsewhere, below normal high temperatures for July are expected
for the Midwest and Central Plains Monday and Midwest and
Southeast Tuesday behind the current storm system, with highs
mainly in the 80s. The chance for showers and thunderstorms will
increase across the Northern and Central Plains and into the
Central Rockies by Tuesday as a cold front moves south across the
region from Canada.

couple of days. Heavy rain and potential flooding is also possible
from the Southern Plains to the Southeast as the cold front
progresses slowly eastward.  A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
is in effect for the the Lower Mississippi Valley and the
Tennessee Valley on Monday as mean flow roughly parallel to the
front may lead to repeated heavy rainfall over some areas. Rain
totals of 1-2 inches are possible with some isolated amounts of up
to 4 inches.

Excessive heat will continue to make weather headlines across the
western third of the nation. A stubborn upper-level high anchored
over the Desert Southwest is the primary factor in the ongoing
heat wave, but this is expected to slowly erode some going into
the beginning of the week. Highs in the 110s in the Desert
Southwest and central California Valleys today should dip back
down into the mid-100s for Monday and Tuesday. Widespread heat
will also continue over the Great Basin, with  highs in the
mid-100s Sunday and the upper 90s to 100 Monday and Tuesday.
However, this small relative cool down is of little relief to
areas that have seen long-term oppressive and above normal
temperatures. Excessive heat warnings remain in effect for a
majority of locations in the region through Tuesday. Relative
above normal temperatures look to hold on the longest over the
Interior Pacific Northwest, with highs in the upper 90s to 100
through the forecast period.  It is also worth noting that
overnight lows have also been impressive with this heat wave, with
lows failing to drop below the lower 90s for portions of the
Desert Southwest.

Some relief from the extreme heat may arrive in the form of
monsoonal showers and thunderstorms each day across portions of
Arizona and New Mexico, which will increase in coverage and
intensity through the period. A Marginal Risk for excessive
rainfall is in effect on Monday with a Slight Risk in effect for
Tuesday. The greatest threat is for heavy downpours with rain
rates of up to 2 inches per hour that may lead to the rapid onset
of flash flooding, especially for arid locations where such rain
rates are a more rare event. In addition to the threat for
flooding, severe weather is also possible. The Storm Prediction
Center has issued a Slight Risk for severe thunderstorms today for
the threat of high winds and hail, with a Marginal Risk in effect
for Monday.

Elsewhere, below normal high temperatures for July are expected
for the Midwest and Central Plains Monday and the Midwest and
Southeast Tuesday behind the current storm system, with highs
mainly in the 80s. The chance for showers and thunderstorms will
increase across the Northern and Central Plains as well as the
Central Rockies by Monday evening and into the day Tuesday as a
cold front moves south across the region from Canada.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for the Northeast, Midwest,
and the South...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. into Tuesday...

At the beginning of the short-range forecast period, a low
pressure center was located over the Middle Mississippi Valley
which will continue slowly to the north-northeast over the next
couple of days. A warm front extended east through the Ohio Valley
and into the Mid-Atlantic, with a cold front extending
southwestward through the Lower Mississippi Valley and the
Southern Plains. More unsettled weather is expected in the
Northeast over the next couple of days as the slow moving warm
front advances northward bringing anomalously high low-level
moisture (dewpoints in the low to mid-70s). Widespread heavy rain
with embedded thunderstorms are likely. A Moderate Risk for
excessive rainfall is in effect for the greater New York City area
Monday. A Slight Risk is in effect for additional portions of
eastern Pennsylvania and New York as well as southern New England.
Heavy rain totals of 1 to 2 inches and higher over an urbanized
area which recently saw heavy rainfall, leading to saturated
soils, is a significant concern for additional flooding. Heavy
rainfall will also be a concern across central portions of upstate
New York east through southern Vermont and New Hampshire, where
some isolated amounts of 2 to 4 inch are possible through Tuesday
morning. For Tuesday, a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall is in
effect for portions of upstate New York east of Lake Ontario to
the Adirondacks, where isolated rain totals of up to 4 inches are
also possible. This may lead to some potential flooding and rises
on area rivers, especially over river basins that have received
above average rainfall over the past several days. Marginal Risks
for excessive rainfall are in effect further west along the warm
front and ahead of the cold front from the Lower Great Lakes south
to the Ohio Valley for widespread rain of around 1-2 inches over
the next couple of days. Heavy rain and potential flooding is also
possible from the Southern Plains to the Southeast as the cold
front progresses slowly eastward.  A Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall is in effect for the the Lower Mississippi Valley and the
Tennessee Valley on Monday as mean flow roughly parallel to the
front may lead to repeated heavy rainfall over some areas. Rain
totals of 1-2 inches are possible with some isolated amounts of up

...Western Heat Persists This Week in the Great Basin and northern
Rockies and Spreads into the Northern Plains...

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The modest northwest US trough is forecast to gradually
retrograde, with the forecast for rebuilding heights over the
Great Basin to the central Rockies and northern Plains as a closed
low persists off the west coast of Canada next weekend. Above
normal temperatures are expected across much of the northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies/High Plains next Fri 16 July- Sun 18
July, with cluster of high temperatures reaching 10-15 degrees
above normal next weekend into early next week.
As the upper ridge amplifies next Monday, the anomalies gradually
increase, peaking 15-20 degrees above normal in eastern Mt next
Mon 19 Jul.

Lingering upper ridging over the western Atlantic and into the
Southeast may also support above normal temperatures this week
from the Mid-Atlantic to the Northeast.  Over next weekend, the
upper trough drifts east from the Lakes toward the northeast,
driving a cold front across the region. This increases
shower/storm chances with the front, followed by post-frontal
cooling in the lower Lakes and then next Sunday 18 July into the
adjacent northern mid Atlantic/New England.

The forecast does indicate potential for temperature moderating
showers/thunderstorms over Arizona/Southern Rockies this week with
pockets of enhanced 700 mb relative humidity in place to support
diurnal activity with instability peaking each afternoon/evening.
This may lead to local downpour and terrain enhancing runoff
issues, as recent activity has moistened soils.

With a wavy front in the Midwest to the central Plains, additional
rounds of heavy showers and storms are forecast near the
meandering front, instability and upwards of 1.75" precipitable
water values. The models have rainfall maxima gradually shifting
south across the the Mid-MS/OH Valleys late week and next weekend
with slow frontal progression. The rain threat area drifts south
next weekend and Monday 19 July down the Plains, MS Valley and
from the OH Valley into the TN Valley, central-southern
Appalachians, and mid Atlantic.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance forecast spread and uncertainty remains below normal this
week with a main exception of shortwaves progressing through a
mean Great Lakes trough and whether a closed low develops within
the 500 mb trough next weekend near the Lakes/adjacent Canada. The
WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a blend
of best clustered guidance from the 12 UTC ECMWF/12z ECMWF
Ensemble Mean/18z GEFS Mean.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1217 AM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper-level ridging will remain entrenched across the West today.
Another shortwave trough will move into the Northwest, though this
particular trough will be weaker than on Sunday. Mid-level moisture
will continue to work its way to the north and west across the
Southwest and Great Basin. Strong heating from the Columbia Basin
into the northern Great Basin will deepen a thermal pressure trough.

...Northern/central Great Basin...
Though the approaching shortwave trough will be relatively weak, an
enhancement in mid-level winds will occur across parts of Oregon
into northern Nevada. These increasing winds aloft and the thermal
pressure trough will combine to bring dry and windy conditions
across these areas. Sustained elevated conditions are most likely
across northern Nevada. Winds will reach 15-20 mph with RH falling
to 10-20%. East of the Cascades in Oregon, a few areas of
terrain-enhanced winds from the Columbia Gorge southward may reach
15-20 mph for an hour or two. RH will likely fall to near 15-20%.
Ongoing fires in the lee of the Cascades may be impacted.

A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms is possible over areas of dry
fuels in central Nevada into central Utah. Storm motions will be
greater and PWAT a bit lower with northward extent, especially in
Nevada, leading to a higher probability of dry storms.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 AM CDT Mon Jul 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
The low-amplitude shortwave trough in the Northwest will continue to
the east into the northern Rockies on Tuesday. This will flatten the
upper ridge across the West. Continued mid-level moisture influx
into the Great Basin will bring another day of thunderstorm chances
across much of the region, though storms will trend more towards the
wet side of the spectrum.

...Northwest Nevada...
Zephyr winds will reach 15-20 mph with RH in the 10-20% range during
afternoon and evening. With weaker winds aloft than on Monday,
elevated conditions will generally be tied to the lee of the Sierra.
Locally elevated conditions could occur farther east.

...Southern Idaho into southwest Wyoming...
Mid-level flow will be enhanced on the southern flank of the
shortwave trough. Winds will reach 15-20 mph, though localized
speeds of 20-25 mph will be possible. RH is expected to be in the
15-20% range.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
The potential for dry thunderstorms appears low on Tuesday as an
increase in PWAT and slow storm speeds will increase wetting rain
potential in the Great Basin. A dry storm or two would be most
likely to occur within the Uintas, along the fringes of higher PWAT
and boundary layer RH.

...Heavy rain and potential flooding for parts of the Eastern U.S.
and the Desert Southwest...

...Heat wave continues for much of the western U.S. through early
this week...

More unsettled weather returns to the Northeast U.S. to begin the
week as a slow moving warm front and surface low advances
northward and leads to widespread moderate to heavy rain with
embedded thunderstorms.  It appears the heaviest rainfall will
likely be across eastern Pennsylvania and eastward towards the
greater New York City metro area, where some patchy 1 to 3 inch
totals are possible through Wednesday morning.  This may lead to
some potential flooding and rises on area rivers, especially over
urban areas that have received above average rainfall over the
past week.  A Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect for
this area given the highly saturated grounds and the additional
heavy rainfall expected.

Portions of the Deep South are also expected to have bad weather
through early Tuesday as deep moisture from the Gulf of Mexico
surges northward ahead of a nearly stationary frontal boundary,
which should eventually dissipate.  The heaviest rain is
anticipated across central and northern Alabama, and some 3+ inch
rainfall totals are within the realm of possibility where repeated
rounds of thunderstorms develop.  In terms of severe weather
potential, there is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms across
portions of the central Florida Peninsula on Monday owing to
greater instability, with damaging winds being the main threat.

The intense heat wave that has been setting records across the
southwestern U.S. has peaked for most areas, with a gradual return
to more seasonal temperatures by later in the week.  However,
excessive heat warnings remain in effect from California to Utah
since readings will still be well above normal for Monday.  Some
additional record highs are likely on Monday, although not as many
as this past weekend.  It is also worth noting that overnight lows
have also been impressive with this heat wave, with lows failing
to drop below the lower 90s for the normally warmer locations of
the Desert Southwest.  Some localized relief from the extreme heat
may arrive in the form of monsoonal showers and storms each day
across portions of Arizona and New Mexico.  Some of these storms
will produce heavy rainfall that may result in flooding for flood
prone areas.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1247 AM CST Mon Mar 07 2022/

...Synopsis...
A strong mid-level trough will move eastward from the upper Midwest
into the Northeast today. Farther west, another trough will dig
southward into the Four Corners. Cold air and high pressure will be
in place from the Great Basin into the Plains. Fire weather concerns
will generally remain low for most areas.

Some locally elevated conditions may develop in parts of eastern
Georgia into central South Carolina ahead of the approaching cold
front. Fine fuel moisture has been reduced some during Sunday's warm
and dry conditions. However, RH may only fall below 35% on a very
spatially limited basis.

In California, warm and dry downslope winds are possible within the
Sacramento Valley and the higher terrain of southern California. Due
to recent precipitation, fuels are not receptive enough to fire
spread for highlights.

...Winter storm threats for parts of the Corn Belt/Great Lakes
Thursday-Friday and from the Mid-South to the interior Northeast
Friday-Saturday...

...Heavy rainfall likely across portions of the Southeast
Thursday-Friday...


...Overview...

A strong shortwave in the Great Basin/Southwest early Thursday
will bring record cold to some areas of the interior West. This
will move into the Mid-South by early Saturday as a northern
stream shortwave digs through the Upper Midwest into the Great
Lakes. These features will likely combine/interact to support
strong cyclogenesis into the Appalachians in a classic spring
system featuring snow and cold temperatures to the north/northwest
of the surface low with warm/wet conditions ahead of the cold
front. By next week, pattern may become quasi-zonal with quieter
conditions in the East in the wake of the departing system, with
weak/modest systems into the Pacific Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Trend in the guidance for the central/eastern system has been
overall slower, favoring more interaction between the
northern/southern stream, but with continued differences in how
the surface low quickly evolves out of the Lower Mississippi
Valley including its track to the northeast. The 06Z GFS was
closer to the 00Z ECMWF than its 00Z run, and this agreement
carried across to their ensemble means as well, forming the basis
for the surface progs. The 00Z Canadian was close to this
consensus as well, though it was a little slower with the southern
trough and quicker with the northern trough, yielding a weaker
system overall. The 00Z UKMET was most outside the consensus as a
low probability solution. Overall pattern remains rather
progressive despite the rapid deepening of the surface low (a bit
characteristic of this winter pattern), but further refinements
slower or faster are probable.

For next week, deterministic models diverge (rather expectedly) in
the quasi-zonal pattern. Trended toward a majority ensemble mean
consensus with weaker systems out of the Pacific having lower
predictability.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms should be ongoing by Thursday across the
Southeast as a frontal boundary settles over the region with ample
moisture and instability present. This boundary should finally
become absorbed/pushed east/lift northward with the strong cold
front on Saturday. Rainfall will come in waves over the Southeast,
some of which could be heavy and flooding/flash flooding may be a
threat especially where multiple rounds of convection track over
the same areas during the period, despite the dry soil moisture
currently that may abate starting just before the medium range
period.

Troughing in the West will support a multi-wave and dynamic storm
system that will first spread snowfall across the Corn Belt
Thursday ahead of the strong arctic front to the northwest. As the
southern portion of the system develops, cold air will pour
through the central Plains and could support rain changing to snow
behind the front Friday evening with some accumulation even into
the Lower Mississippi Valley. As the surface low rapidly deepens
and moves into the interior Northeast, rainfall will surge
northward through all of New England with snow, possibly heavy,
over the eastern Great Lakes that will move eastward as cold air
wraps around the low. Precipitation will be much lighter next week
in the Pacific Northwest as well as into the Great Lakes as a
clipper system moves through.

Arctic-sourced air will bleed through the interior West and spill
into the Plains on the backside of the front, with daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas through Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains and in higher elevations
of the Rockies are likely to be near or below zero for many
locations with record lows possible in some locations. Ahead of
the cold front, above normal temperatures should spread across the
eastern third of the country Thursday and Friday before being
replaced by below normal temperatures this coming weekend
following the passage of the cold front. Meanwhile, by next week
parts of the West and central U.S. may see moderately above normal
temperatures as periodic upper ridging slides through.

A strong shortwave in the Great Basin/Southwest early Thursday
will bring record cold to some areas of the interior West. This
will move into the Mid-South by early Saturday as a northern
stream shortwave digs through the Upper Midwest into the Great
Lakes. These features will likely combine/interact to support
strong cyclogenesis into the Appalachians in a classic spring
system featuring snow and cold temperatures to the north/northwest
of the surface low with warm/wet conditions ahead of the cold

...Gusty winds to impact the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic tonight...

...Numerous showers and scattered thunderstorms forecast across
the Deep South on Tuesday and Southeast/Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday,
with the potential for light snow from the central Appalachians to
the northern Mid-Atlantic...

...Moderate to heavy snowfall overspreading the northern Great
Basin and northern Rockies tonight to eventually enter the central
High Plains on Wednesday...


A powerful cold front swinging through the eastern U.S. tonight
will usher in much colder temperatures to the region, as well as
the potential for gusty winds. Outside of of a few lingering
showers along the East Coast and moderate snowfall located over
the northern tip of Maine, the most widespread impacts into
Tuesday morning will be associated with gusty winds. Wind
Advisories are in effect from the southern Appalachians to
southern New England. Gusts could approach 50 mph and lead to tree
damage, isolated power outages, and difficult driving conditions
for high profile vehicles.

Farther south, the aforementioned cold front is expected to stall
across the Southeast and Gulf Coast on Tuesday until a developing
area of low pressure moves along the frontal boundary and off the
Mid-Atlantic coast on Wednesday. As a result, lingering showers
and isolated thunderstorms will gradually increase in coverage on
Tuesday afternoon throughout the Deep South. By Wednesday,
precipitation will spread north of the low pressure system and
into the northern Mid-Atlantic. Cold temperatures aloft will allow
for snow to fall across parts of the central Appalachians, as well
as northern Maryland, Pennsylvania, and parts of the Northeast.
Besides the highest terrain, most of the snow that falls after
sunrise will struggle to accumulate given surface temperatures
around freezing and the increasing March sun angle. Therefore,
only a few inches of accumulating snow on grassy surfaces is
expected for this region. Much needed rain is anticipated to
continue throughout the Southeast on Wednesday.

Shifting to the western U.S., a potent cold front diving southward
out of Canada will set the stage for widespread snowfall
throughout the northern Great Basin and northern Rockies tonight
and Tuesday. Locally heavy snow is possible across the tallest
mountain peaks of Idaho and Montana. By Wednesday, the cold front
is forecast to sink into the central Great Basin and central
Rockies, which will also shift the axis of moderate snowfall south
as well. Additionally, a strengthening upper-level jet will allow
for locally heavy snow to extend into the central High Plains.
Snowfall totals over 6 inches are possible by the end of the event
on Thursday from southeast Wyoming to southern Nebraska and far
northern Kansas. Heavy snowfall more than a foot is also possible
throughout the higher terrain of northern Utah, Wyoming, and
Colorado. Meanwhile, temperatures 20 to 30 degrees below average
will also follow in the wake of the system across the northern
Plains into the middle of the week. Highs will struggle to reach
out of the teens and 20s, making it feel more like the middle of
winter.

...Synopsis...
Broad cyclonic flow aloft will develop across most of the lower 48
on Tuesday. With high pressure and cooler temperatures, fire weather
concerns will be low for most areas. Portions of the Southwest will
remain quite dry. Some modest westerly flow aloft could promote a
weak lee trough in the southern High Plains. Even so, winds are
still expected to be light. Any elevated conditions would be highly
localized.

300 PM EST Mon March 07 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 13 - 17 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting a 500-hPa flow
pattern consistent with the positive phase of the NAO. Broad troughing is
forecast across the Davis Strait and southern Greenland while anomalous
ridging
is forecast to the south across most of the mid-latitude North Atlantic.
Farther to the west, a weakening trough is predicted across the Great Lakes
region. Low amplitude flow and accompanying above normal heights are predic=
ted
across much of the western and south-central CONUS. A complex flow pattern =
is
forecast across Alaska as a cut-off ridge is likely to the northwest of the
state and trough is predicted farther to the south near the Aleutians. An
elevated height gradient is likely across southeastern Alaska and the
northwestern CONUS, increasing the probability of enhanced Pacific Flow acr=
oss
these regions.

Below normal temperatures are favored across the Great Lakes and Southeast =
in
association with a weakening trough predicted over eastern North America.  =
A
moderating trend is likely for the Mid-Atlantic States, consistent with the
predicted positive phase of the NAO. Broad, low amplitude flow and above
normal
heights lead to increased odds of near to above normal temperatures for the
West eastward to the Central Plains. Below normal temperatures are most lik=
ely
for northern and eastern Alaska, downstream of the cut-off ridge forecast o=
ver
eastern Siberia.  Conversely, above normal temperatures are slightly favore=
d
for the Alaska Peninsula and extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska, ahead of
the
mean trough predicted near the Aleutians.

An active pattern is favored for southeastern Alaska and the northwestern
CONUS
due to the likelihood of enhanced Pacific Flow across these regions.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent for parts of =
the
Alaska Panhandle, Pacific Northwest, and Northern Rockies.  An enhanced
temperature gradient is likely across the northern Tier of the CONUS,
promoting
a mean storm track across this region. Therefore, increased odds of near to
above normal precipitation are indicated across most of the northern third =
of
the CONUS. Below normal precipitation is favored well to the south of the m=
ean
storm track, across most of the southern two-thirds of the CONUS.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 35% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement on a positive NAO pattern offset by a trend toward increase=
d
low amplitude flow and a variable pattern across much of the forecast domai=
n.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 15 - 21 2022

During the week-2 period, a 500-hPa flow pattern consistent with the positi=
ve
phase of the NAO is likely to persist. Height anomalies are generally forec=
ast
to weaken across much of the CONUS, as the flow pattern is forecast to beco=
me
increasingly zonal. Consistent with this predicted zonal pattern, an increa=
sed
height gradient is likely across much of the CONUS from north to south,
promoting enhanced Westerlies across much of the country.  These enhanced
Westerlies, in turn, are likely to promote increased Pacific Flow and a
variable pattern across much of the CONUS as storm systems quickly traverse
the
country from west to east.  Farther to the north and west, a cut-off ridge
over
eastern Siberia is forecast to retrograde while a trough near the Aleutians
early in the period progresses eastward across the Gulf of Alaska and towar=
d
the Panhandle with time. This pattern evolution is likely to result in mean
cyclonic flow across much of Alaska with below normal heights favored acros=
s
most of the Mainland and Panhandle.

Residual troughing forecast early in the period leads to increased chances =
of
below normal temperatures for the western Great Lakes and the western Gulf
Coast regions.  A moderating trend consistent with the positive phase of th=
e
NAO is likely for most of the Eastern Seaboard, favoring above normal
temperatures.  Predicted zonal flow and near to above normal heights leads =
to
increased chances of near to above normal temperatures across the western
CONUS
to the Central Plains. Near to below normal temperatures are most likely fo=
r
Alaska underneath forecast cyclonic flow and near to below normal heights.

With enhanced Pacific Flow expected, increased odds of above normal
precipitation are indicated for the northwestern CONUS and southeastern
Alaska.
Predicted increased zonal flow and enhanced Westerlies favor a storm track =
and
associated elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of th=
e
northern third of the CONUS. Below normal precipitation is most likely for
much
of the southwestern and sound-central CONUS as well as the Florida Peninsul=
a,
well to the south of the predicted mean storm track. However, near to above
normal precipitation is favored across the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio
valleys, due to the potential for return flow moisture advecting northward =
to
the west of surface high pressure forecast over the Atlantic. Conversely, n=
ear
to below normal precipitation is favored for northern and western Alaska,
downstream of a ridge predicted over eastern Siberia.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 40% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement on a positive NAO pattern offset by a transition toward zon=
al
flow and a variable pattern across much of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

SYNOPSIS: The jet stream pattern is forecast to become more progressive
through
the next 8 to 14 days (week-2). At the start of week-2, surface low pressur=
e
is
expected to exit the Northeast coast of the lower 48, leading to residual c=
old
air over parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes region in its wake.
Farther
west, mid-level low pressure is expected to move eastward from the Pacific
Northwest to the Great Plains during the first half of the period, bringing
the
increased potential for heavy, high-elevation snowfall across parts of Rock=
ies
and high winds across parts of the Great Plains. During the middle and latt=
er
portions of week-2, surface low pressure is expected to develop across the
Great Plains and move eastward, bringing the threat of high winds to easter=
n
parts of the lower 48. Over Alaska, the storm track is likely to remain acr=
oss
southern portions of the state, but precipitation amounts will likely not b=
e
hazardous in nature.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Lakes =
and
Upper Midwest, Tue, Mar 15.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the northern Cascade=
s,
Tue, Mar 15.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of the Bitterroot
Mountains
and parts of the northern Rockies, Tue-Wed, Mar 15-16.

Slight risk of heavy snow for the higher elevations of parts of the norther=
n
and central Rockies, Wed-Fri, Mar 16-18.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Northern and Central High Plains=
,
Tue-Wed, Mar 15-16.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of Mid-Atlantic, southern Appalachians,
and
Middle Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Thu-Sat, Mar 17-19.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 10 - MONDAY MARCH 14:

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 15 - MONDAY MARCH 21: Today's GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian m=
ean
500-hPa height forecasts favor a transition to a more zonal pattern during
week-2 across the CONUS. Early in the period, Mar 15, residual cold across
portions of the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest are likely in the wake of a l=
ow
pressure system exiting the Northeast coast. Although the ECMWF ensemble
reforecast tool is not as keen on higher probabilities for much below norma=
l
temperatures exceeding hazardous thresholds, the GEFS reforecast tool does
indicate at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling below the 15=
th
percentile of the climatological distribution at the start of the period
across
this region. A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for
parts of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes for Mar 15, primarily based on t=
he
GEFS reforecast tool. Areas in the Upper Midwest are particularly at risk,
where there is at least a 20% chance of experiencing subzero minimum
temperatures Mar 15 in both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools.
Seasonal snowpack also reinforces this potential for extreme cold.



During the first half of week-2, a mid-level trough is forecast to traverse
the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies before amplifying over the Central
Plains. Slight risks for heavy snow are posted for the higher elevations of
the
northern Cascades (Mar 15) and the Bitterroot Mountains and northern Rockie=
s
(Mar 15-16), where the experimental snow GEFS reforecast tool indicates at
least a 20% chance of snow water equivalent (SWE) values exceeding the 85th
percentile of the climatological distribution. As surface low pressure
intensifies across the Central Plains ahead of the mid-level trough, strong
easterly upslope flow is expected on its northern periphery, warranting a
slight risk for heavy snow for parts of the central and northern Rockies, M=
ar
16-18. Some localized areas along the Front Range are also depicted as havi=
ng
at least a 30% chance for SWE to exceed the 85th percentile.



Early in week-2, as the mid-level trough exits the Rockies, the surface
pattern
is favorable for enhanced downslope flow east of the Rockies. A slight risk=
 of
high winds is posted for parts of the Central and Northern High Plains, Mar
15-16, where the ECMWF ensemble reforecast tool indicates at least a 20-30%
chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile. As surface low pressur=
e
amplifies and moves eastward across the eastern U.S., the progressive long-
wave
pattern supports an increased potential for a strong low-level jet ahead of
the
trailing frontal boundary. Therefore, a slight risk for high winds is also
posted from the Middle Mississippi Valley extending northeastward to the
Mid-Atlantic and southern New England, Mar 17-19.



Given the progressive nature of the pattern, supported by the forecast
positive
phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, no heavy precipitation hazards are
posted at this time for the lower 48.



In Alaska, although an active storm track is favored across southern parts =
of
the state, precipitation is also not likely to reach hazardous thresholds. =
In
addition, the mean surface pattern is not favorable for any temperature or
wind
hazards at this time.

Valid 12Z Thu Mar 10 2022 - 12Z Mon Mar 14 2022

...Winter storm threats for parts of the Corn Belt/Great Lakes
Thursday-Friday and from the Mid-South to the interior Northeast
Friday-Saturday...

...Heavy rainfall likely across portions of the Southeast
Thursday-Friday...


...Overview...

A strong shortwave in the Great Basin/Southwest early Thursday
will bring record cold to some areas of the interior West. This
will move into the Mid-South by early Saturday as a northern
stream shortwave digs through the Upper Midwest into the Great
Lakes. These features will likely combine/interact to support
strong cyclogenesis into the Appalachians in a classic spring
system featuring snow and cold temperatures to the north/northwest
of the surface low with warm/wet conditions ahead of the cold
front. By next week, pattern may become quasi-zonal with quieter
conditions in the East in the wake of the departing system, with
weak/modest systems into the Pacific Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Trend in the guidance for the central/eastern system has been
overall slower, favoring more interaction between the
northern/southern stream, but with continued differences in how
the surface low quickly evolves out of the Lower Mississippi
Valley including its track to the northeast. The 06Z GFS was
closer to the 00Z ECMWF than its 00Z run, and this agreement
carried across to their ensemble means as well, forming the basis
for the surface progs. The 00Z Canadian was close to this
consensus as well, though it was a little slower with the southern
trough and quicker with the northern trough, yielding a weaker
system overall. The 00Z UKMET was most outside the consensus as a
low probability solution. Overall pattern remains rather
progressive despite the rapid deepening of the surface low (a bit
characteristic of this winter pattern), but further refinements
slower or faster are probable.

For next week, deterministic models diverge (rather expectedly) in
the quasi-zonal pattern. Trended toward a majority ensemble mean
consensus with weaker systems out of the Pacific having lower
predictability.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms should be ongoing by Thursday across the
Southeast as a frontal boundary settles over the region with ample
moisture and instability present. This boundary should finally
become absorbed/pushed east/lift northward with the strong cold
front on Saturday. Rainfall will come in waves over the Southeast,
some of which could be heavy and flooding/flash flooding may be a
threat especially where multiple rounds of convection track over
the same areas during the period, despite the dry soil moisture
currently that may abate starting just before the medium range
period.

Troughing in the West will support a multi-wave and dynamic storm
system that will first spread snowfall across the Corn Belt
Thursday ahead of the strong arctic front to the northwest. As the
southern portion of the system develops, cold air will pour
through the central Plains and could support rain changing to snow
behind the front Friday evening with some accumulation even into
the Lower Mississippi Valley. As the surface low rapidly deepens
and moves into the interior Northeast, rainfall will surge
northward through all of New England with snow, possibly heavy,
over the eastern Great Lakes that will move eastward as cold air
wraps around the low. Precipitation will be much lighter next week
in the Pacific Northwest as well as into the Great Lakes as a
clipper system moves through.

Arctic-sourced air will bleed through the interior West and spill
into the Plains on the backside of the front, with daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas through Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains and in higher elevations
of the Rockies are likely to be near or below zero for many
locations with record lows possible in some locations. Ahead of
the cold front, above normal temperatures should spread across the
eastern third of the country Thursday and Friday before being
replaced by below normal temperatures this coming weekend
following the passage of the cold front. Meanwhile, by next week
parts of the West and central U.S. may see moderately above normal
temperatures as periodic upper ridging slides through.

...Winter storm threats for parts of the Mid-South to the interior
Northeast Friday-Saturday...

...Heavy rainfall likely across portions of the Southeast on
Friday...


...Overview...

A potent shortwave in the southern Rockies and a northern stream
shortwave through the Midwest early Friday will combine to support
strong cyclogenesis into the Eastern U.S. by Saturday. This
classic spring system will feature snow and cold to the
north/northwest of the surface low, and warm/wet conditions ahead
of the cold front. Upper flow should then become quasi-zonal
Sunday-Monday with a weak shortwave into the Northwest, though may
amplify with time as it reaches the East on Tuesday. The next
shortwave should reach the Pacific Northwest by next Tuesday as
well.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

The guidance seems to be trending towards better agreement with
the central/eastern system Friday-Saturday, although some timing
differences continue with the cold front into the East. The GFS
has consistently been on the faster side of the envelope, although
has trended slower with each of its past few runs and is now in
reasonable agreement. The 12z/Mar 7 UKMET is also a hair faster
and also quicker to occlude the system over the Northeast.
Incoming 00z guidance tonight overall had the same general
feeling, although the UKMET was slower and more in line. Given the
slower trend seen in all the guidance the past few days, the WPC
progs favored something closer to the slower EC/CMC for days 3-4,
however, overall the pattern remains rather progressive despite
rapid deepening of the surface low, and further refinements slower
or faster are probable. At this point, these are details that will
take until the short range period to fully resolve. So it's hard
to throw any solution off the table at this point.

After this system, deterministic models diverge more within a
quasi-zonal pattern. The 18z/March 7 GFS is quicker with the first
shortwave into the Pacific Northwest Sunday, but the ECMWF catches
up to it by Monday across the central Plains and both are rather
progressive downstream. The 12z/Mar 7 CMC is the real outlier
here, with a more amplified shortwave and overall slower
progression which eventually ends up with a closed low over the
lower Mississippi Valley next Tuesday. The second shortwave into
the Pacific Northwest early Tuesday shows pretty good agreement
right now timing wise. After day 5, the WPC blend leans
increasingly more towards the ensemble means (with some modest
contributions from the GFS/ECMWF) to help mitigate the
differences.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Showers and thunderstorms should still be ongoing Friday across
the Southeast as a frontal boundary remains parked over the region
with ample moisture and instability present. This boundary should
finally become absorbed/pushed east/lift northward with the strong
cold front on Saturday though. Rainfall will come in waves over
the Southeast, some of which could be heavy and flooding/flash
flooding may be a threat especially where multiple rounds of
convection train over the same areas and combined with heavy
rainfall the previous day in the same region. Given this
potential, the WPC day 4 (Friday) newly experimental excessive
rainfall outlook highlights a slight risk area from the Florida
Big Bend to southeast Georgia.

Cold air pouring into the Central U.S. behind the developing storm
system into Friday will support rain changing to snow behind the
front Friday evening, with accumulations possible as far south as
the lower Mississippi Valley. The rapidly deepening surface low
into the Northeast should allow for possibly heavy snow across the
lower Great Lakes/interior Northeast. Widespread, though quick
moving, rain is likely ahead of the front in the East.

The arctic airmass behind the front will bring daytime highs
20-30+ degrees below normal as far south as Texas on Friday.
Overnight lows across the northern Plains and in higher elevations
of the Rockies are likely to be near or below zero for many
locations. Modifying some with time, the cold air will shift into
the Midwest on Saturday and the Eastern U.S. on Sunday following
the frontal passage (with above normal temps ahead of it). Even
for parts of northern Florida and the Southeast, low temperatures
Sunday morning could be near or below freezing with record lows
possible in some locations. By next week, parts of the West and
central U.S. may see moderately above normal temperatures as
periodic upper ridging slides through.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CST Tue Mar 08 2022

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure and accompanying cooler temperatures are
expected to suppress widespread significant wildfire-spread concerns
across most of the CONUS today. The main exception would be the far
southern High Plains/Trans Pecos region in southern New Mexico into
far west Texas, where modest surface lee troughing will encourage
dry downslope flow. By afternoon, 15 mph sustained winds coinciding
with 15-20 percent RH will promote Elevated fire weather conditions.
Given the presence of modestly dry fuels, Elevated fire weather
highlights have been introduced.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0153 AM CST Tue Mar 08 2022

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level impulse embedded within the broader cyclonic upper flow
regime will impinge on the southern Rockies tomorrow/Wednesday,
encouraging surface low development across the southern High Plains
in advance of another southward-surging cold front. Gradient flow
associated with the surface cyclone will promote critically dry and
windy conditions across parts of the southern High Plains, where
wildfire-spread concerns will exist.

...Southern High Plains...
As the surface low develops and deepens near the New Mexico and
Oklahoma Panhandle border area tomorrow afternoon, sustained
westerly surface winds over 20 mph amid 15 percent RH will be
possible on a widespread basis across central and eastern New Mexico
into far west Texas. In this area, latest fuel guidance shows 100-hr
fuel moisture below 10 percent with a severe drought in place.
Forecast ERCs are expected to range from 60-80 percent across
southwest New Mexico to near 90 percent in far southwestern Texas,
warranting the introduction of Critical highlights from the Oklahoma
Panhandle southwest into southwestern New Mexico. In central into
southern and western New Mexico, fire weather concerns will be
greatest in lower-terrain areas, where finer fuels would be most
dry. At least Elevated meteorological surface conditions are
expected across the Trans Pecos region in southwest Texas, with
locally Critical conditions possible by afternoon peak heating.
Critical highlights may be expanded into the Trans Pecos region in
future outlooks should guidance depict a stronger surface wind
field, or if fuels become drier than anticipated.

...Cold air spills into the Rockies and Great Plains through
late-week; Critical Fire Weather Risk issued for portions of the
Southern Plains on Wednesday...

Persistent upper-level troughing in the West will contribute to an
active weather pattern for much of the country over the next
couple of days. A piece of shortwave energy will slide down the
spine of the Rockies over the coming days. This bit of energy will
allow for a low pressure systems to form, deepen and move south
through the Intermountain West. Heavy snow will develop and impact
portions of the Cascades, Northern Great Basin and
Northern/Central Rockies, while light rain falls over low lying
areas of the Pacific Northwest through Wednesday. Winter Storm
Warnings and Advisories are in effect for the mountainous areas.
The threat of heavy snow will linger over the Central Rockies
while simultaneously spreading into the Front Range and Central
Plains on Wednesday, where Winter Storm Watches are in effect.

Additionally, on the backside of this system, temperatures will
take a tumble due to the arrival of very frigid air from southern
Canada. This cold airmass will plunge high temperatures across the
Rockies and Plains down into the 20s and 30s, with some isolated
areas of North Dakota failing to climb out of the single digits
through the end of the week. The cold front responsible for the
dip in temperatures will tighten the local pressure gradient
leading to windy conditions across the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle
into eastern New Mexico on Wednesday. Windy and dry conditions
will contribute to a Critical Fire Weather Risk for that day.
Meanwhile, from the Deep South up into the Mid-Atlantic, a stalled
out front will be the focus for moderate to heavy rain and
scattered thunderstorms over the next couple of days. Sufficient
cold air may lock into the Central Appalachians, Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast to allow for some light snow accumulations tonight.

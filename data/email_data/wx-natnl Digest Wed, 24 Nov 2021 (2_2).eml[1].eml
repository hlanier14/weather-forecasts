Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 AM EST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Nov 27 2021 - 12Z Wed Dec 01 2021

...Overview...

The upper level flow during the medium range period should remain
mostly stagnant and amplified consisting of mean troughing in the
East and ridging out West. A southern stream upper low over Baja
California on Saturday should weaken with the leftover energy
shifting into the southern Plains and eventually being absorbed by
the Eastern U.S. trough. A couple of shortwaves into the Eastern
trough should help reinforce it through the period. General
ridging should persist out West, though periodically may be
interrupted by weak waves of shortwave energy.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to show good agreement on the large scale flow
pattern but offer plenty of uncertainty still in the details.
Early on, there are some timing/intensity differences with
reloading energy into the Eastern trough, which eventually results
in some placement differences of a deepening low pressure system
off the Northeast coast. The latest GFS is stronger with the
system, while the CMC is farthest south. By day 5/Monday, the GFS
and CMC are a little bit stronger with a shortwave moving into the
Pacific Northwest, which eventually propagates downstream into the
Eastern trough, and offers additional differences in
evolution/shape of the Eastern trough late period. By that point
though, there's enough run to run variability in the models that
leaning more on the ensemble means seems to be the best for now.

The WPC forecast used a general deterministic model blend for days
3-5 amidst decent model agreement. Thereafter, more weighting
towards the ensemble means were used to help mitigate some of the
smaller scale, hard to resolve, detail. Did maintain modest
amounts of the ECMWF and GFS just for some added system
definition. This approach maintains good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast for days 3-6.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Westerly flow across the still relatively warm Great Lakes on
Saturday should provide favorable conditions for lake effect and
interior Northeast (particularly higher elevation) snow. Moderate
to locally heavy snow amounts downwind of Lake Ontario, the
Adirondacks, and northern New England are possible. Meanwhile, a
plume of moisture/atmospheric river coming into the Pacific
Northwest could bring another round of moderate to locally heavy
rains to parts of western Washington, with the heaviest totals
likely along favorable terrain. Lighter precipitation should spill
over into northern parts of the Rockies as well this weekend but
quickly dry out early next week. Then another round of
precipitation is forecast for the Pacific Northwest by around next
Tuesday. The remainder of the country should remain fairly dry
through the weekend and into next week. A weak system moving
through the Ohio Valley into the East and energy across the
southern Plains may bring some light precipitation to these
regions but nothing looks particularly impactful at this time.

A building trough over the East should keep temperatures below
normal through Monday with some moderation back towards normal on
Tuesday and Wednesday. Meanwhile, amplified ridging will promote a
warming trend across the West and into the Plains with several
days of +15 to +25 anomalies (locally higher) likely, especially
across parts of the northern and central Plains Sunday and Monday
and again on Wednesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0144 AM CST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough, evident in water vapor satellite imagery this
morning over the Great Basin, is forecast to move eastward
throughout the day and become more positively tilted.  Meanwhile, a
northeast-southwest oriented upper-level ridge is forecast to
develop over the West in the wake of the departing trough.  At the
surface, low pressure in the vicinity of the Great Lakes will weaken
while an associated cold front will push southward and eastward
across the southern Plains.  In the West, high pressure will build
into the Great Basin, increasing the pressure gradient across
Southern California.

...Portions of Southern California...
As the pressure gradient increases across the region, offshore winds
will increase by late morning.  Downslope processes will aid in
warming and drying, resulting in critical fire weather conditions
beginning around noon local time.  Beginning around this time, winds
aloft will also increase significantly from the northeast, lending
upper-level support to the offshore flow regime.  This upper-level
support will continue through the evening and overnight hours,
likely enhancing gusts to over 60 mph in favored terrain locations.
Given the continued strong offshore flow, RH recovery will be very
poor overnight, resulting in continuous critical fire weather
conditions for many locations through the night into Thursday
morning.

...Portions of Southern High Plains...
Strong northerly winds of 15-20 mph are forecast in the wake of a
cold-frontal passage across the southern High Plains.  Given the dry
airmass in place, critical RH values are also likely to be
concurrent with these strong winds, elevating fire weather
conditions.  Given the eventual cooling and moistening behind the
front, elevated fire weather conditions will progress
south-southeastward through the afternoon.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0149 AM CST Wed Nov 24 2021

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, a closed midlevel low is forecast to develop off of
Baja California, as the northern portion of the upper-level trough
pushes eastward across the Great Lakes Region.  At the surface, high
pressure over the Great Basin will slowly weaken throughout the day.

...Portions of Southern California...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected to be ongoing at the
beginning of the period on Thursday, as the offshore pressure
gradient peaks.  Despite a gradual weakening of the pressure
gradient throughout the rest of the day, critical fire weather
conditions will persist and expand southward in conjunction with the
movement of the upper-level support (i.e., enhanced northeasterly
flow aloft).  Although the peak wind gusts may weaken throughout the
day, gusts of 40-50 mph will still be possible in favored locations
in conjunction with widespread single-digit RH values in the
afternoon.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Although high temperatures are forecast to remain relatively cool
(40s to low 50s F), a very dry airmass and enhanced
westerly-to-northwesterly flow aloft will likely lead to elevated
fire weather conditions.  Boundary-layer heating and mixing are
likely to yield afternoon RH values around 15% and sustained winds
approaching 20 mph. Dry fuels (ERC and 100-hour fuel moisture values
near the 90th percentile) and lack of recent rainfall support
elevated fire weather concerns.

...Unsettled weather to track over the Middle Mississippi Valley
Wednesday night, then into the Great Lakes and Mid-South on
Thanksgiving; thunderstorms and Excessive Rainfall possible in the
South Central U.S...

...Atmospheric River to deliver coastal and valley rain, high
elevation snow to the Pacific Northwest on Thanksgiving...

...Critical Risk of fire weather in Southern California today;
brief warm up in the East, cold Canadian air-mass returns by Black
Friday...

A progressive jet stream pattern atop the Lower 48 makes for
transient temperature regimes and a fast paced storm system
traversing the country this Thanksgiving. An area of low pressure
in the Upper Midwest this morning will have no issues being stuck
in traffic en route to its destination in the Great Lakes this
Thanksgiving. Conditions look mostly dry today, but showers
breaking out along and in front of its associated cold front will
expand from the Lower Great Lakes to South Texas Wednesday night.
By Thanksgiving morning, damp conditions are likely in the Ohio
and mid-Mississippi Valleys. Thunderstorms are also possible in
southeast Texas and in the Lower Mississippi Valley with a
Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall from far East Texas to the
southern Texas border on late Wednesday into Thursday. As the
front marches east Thanksgiving night, so will its precipitation
shield, reaching the East Coast overnight but already making a
quick exit by Black Friday morning. Cold Canadian air filtering
behind the cold front then triggers the formation of lake effect
snow showers with generally light accumulations expected from the
Upper Great Lakes to the central Appalachians.

After a quiet day weather-wise on Wednesday thanks to a brief
bubble of high pressure aloft, the Pacific Northwest braces for
yet another Atmospheric River that makes its arrival Thanksgiving
morning. Western Washington can expect a prolonged barrage of rich
Pacific moisture, resulting in periods of moderate-to-heavy
rainfall on Thanksgiving. A Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall
has been posted in parts of Western Washington for Thanksgiving.
Due to unusually high snow levels, only the highest elevations of
the northern Cascades are likely to witness measurable snowfall.
Aside from spotty showers and light snowfall accumulations in the
Rockies this morning, the vast majority of the West will enjoy an
otherwise dry pattern through Thanksgiving and into Black Friday
thanks to a strengthening dome of upper level high pressure
stretching from California to the Great Plains.

Elsewhere, much of the Southern California coast is under Red Flag
Warnings through Thanksgiving due to ongoing Santa Ana winds. The
Storm Prediction Center has also placed the higher elevations of
Southern California under a Critical Risk for fire weather
conditions today and for Thanksgiving. Temperature-wise, the East
Coast can expect one more day of abnormally chilly temperatures
today, but a brief warm-up arrives on Thanksgiving ahead of an
approaching cold front. This cold front, the one responsible for
the unsettled weather tracking across the East during the short
term period, is set to bring another intrusion of cold Canadian
air into the Midwest and Southern Plains on Thanksgiving. This
surge of colder temperatures reaches the East Coast and Deep South
just in time for the start of the upcoming weekend. Meanwhile in
the West, the aforementioned ridge of high pressure will lead to a
warm-up along the West Coast on Thanksgiving, then quickly
expanding into the Rockies and Great Plains by Black Friday.

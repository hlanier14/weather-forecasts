Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
354 AM EDT Sat Apr 03 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 03 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021

...Another round of freezing temperatures and record-breaking cold
are forecast for the East this morning before moderating Sunday...

...Elevated Risks of fire weather are in place for the Plains
supported by warm temperatures in the western and central CONUS...

A cold high pressure system persisting over the eastern part of
the U.S. will lead to continued chilly temperatures today, with
lows 15 to 25 degrees below average and highs generally 5 to 15
degrees below average. Several daily records for low minimum
temperatures could be set across the Southeast and the
Appalachians eastward. Freeze/Hard Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories are widespread once again this morning for portions of
the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys and much of the
Southeast. These cold temperatures in early April could cause
damage to early-season crops and plants. Temperatures are expected
to moderate closer to normal on Sunday and Monday as the high
weakens.

On the other hand, the western and north-central U.S. can expect
much warmer temperatures over the next few days, with much above
average and possibly record-breaking warm temperatures. The
Southwest should see temperatures in the upper 90s and nearing 100
degrees, while 80s are forecast for northern/central portions of
the Plains. Unfortunately, these warm temperatures combined with
dry soils, low relative humidity, and gusty winds will lead to the
potential for fire weather for parts of the Plains. Per the Storm
Prediction Center, today's Fire Weather Outlook indicates an
Elevated Risk across the Northern Plains, while Sunday has
Elevated Risks across portions of Montana as well as
southern/central parts of the High Plains.

In terms of precipitation, the next couple days still look to be
dry for most areas, but with a few exceptions. The most notable
precipitation should be across the Northwest, as a frontal system
brings moisture to the Pacific Northwest today and to the Northern
Great Basin and Northern Rockies on Sunday. Still, only a few
inches of snow are expected in higher elevations, with light rain
totals in lower elevations. Farther south, isolated rain showers
and thunderstorms are possible today into early Sunday in and
around Texas as an upper-level impulse approaches. Light rain is
possible across portions of the Midwest Sunday into Monday.
Additionally, light rain and snow may occur across the Interior
Northeast today and tonight, while another chance of
precipitation/snow is expected for Maine late Sunday into Monday
as a surface low pressure system in the Atlantic comes near.

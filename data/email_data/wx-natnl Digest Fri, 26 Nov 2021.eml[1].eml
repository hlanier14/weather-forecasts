Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1018 AM CST Thu Nov 25 2021

Valid 251700Z - 261200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

The forecast for high-end Critical to locally Extremely Critical
conditions across portions of southern California remains on track.
Several recent surface observations have depicted single-digit RH
values in close proximity to the Los Angeles metropolitan area, with
a couple METAR sites showing sustained 30-40 mph northeasterly
surface winds in terrain-favoring areas. Latest high-resolution
guidance consensus suggests that high-end Critical meteorological
conditions will persist through 00Z, before surface winds begin to
weaken as the surface pressure gradient diffuses. However, RH
recovery will be very poor tonight, through 12Z Friday, with at
least Elevated to locally Critical conditions expected.

Otherwise, Elevated to locally Critical conditions remain likely
across far southeast Wyoming into the Nebraska Panhandle this
afternoon, when surface temperatures can exceed 50F. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details on the High Plains
wildfire-spread threat.

..Squitieri.. 11/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0143 AM CST Thu Nov 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed mid-level low over portions of southern California/Arizona
and vicinity will retrograde southwestward into portions of the Baja
Peninsula. Meanwhile, an upper-level trough over the central CONUS
will shift east as a strong mid-level jet and zonal flow pattern
enters the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. At the surface,
high pressure over the Great Basin region will weaken throughout the
day.

...Portions of Southern California...
Critical fire-weather conditions will be ongoing this morning and
are expected to persist throughout the day. The regional pressure
gradient will favor strong offshore flow, with sustained winds of
20-30 mph, gusting to 40-50 mph in terrain-favored locations.
Despite the relaxing surface pressure gradient, winds should remain
strong into the afternoon as strong northeasterly mid-level flow
(60-70 kt) aloft overspreads the region. Likewise, RH values will
fall into the teens and single digits throughout the day. Given
these forecast indices, potential exists for localized extremely
critical fire-weather conditions where fuels have cured (e.g., ERC
values exceeding the 80th percentile), in addition to the
critical/elevated delineations.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Diurnally driven momentum transfer of modestly enhanced
northwesterly mid-level flow should yield a period of sustained
winds exceeding 15-20 mph during the afternoon.
Downsloping/compressing surface flow should aid in temperatures
warming into the low 50s F and RH values falling into the teens.
Fuels across the region remain receptive to large-fire spread,
supporting an elevated fire-weather threat.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Mean troughing in the East will be reinforced several times by
shortwaves and maintained throughout much of the medium range
period (Sunday-Thursday). Elsewhere, an amplified ridge across the
West should weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into
the central U.S., which may also help to flatten the overall upper
pattern some by mid to later next week.

The guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for this
large scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in
the details. Energy reloading through the western side of the
trough in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show some slight
timing and magnitude differences, which would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The 00Z/06Z model cycle trended
a bit eastward with the surface low away from the coast compared
to the previous model cycle and WPC forecast, which was generally
maintained with the incoming 12Z models. Guidance was fairly well
clustered with the low position with the main exception of the
UKMET, which has been slower and farther south. Shortwaves moving
through the trough in the East and their potential spinups into
closed lows within the mean trough, as well as the fate of
shortwaves tracking through the eastern Pacific, become less
agreeable in deterministic guidance as the period progresses from
Tuesday onward, with no particularly clear solution at this point.
Though one seemingly clear outlier was the 00Z CMC, which showed a
strong shortwave moving into the West diving south to meet up with
energy over northern Mexico to create a closed low differently
than consensus.

Thus, the WPC forecast began with a blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS,
ECMWF, and CMC, gradually transitioning to a blend that favored
the GEFS and EC ensemble means (along with some component of the
EC and GFS) by around midweek to minimize individual model
differences. Overall this maintained good continuity with the
previous forecast, with the main change the aforementioned shift
of the Atlantic low and its associated precipitation a bit
eastward for this cycle, but will continue to be monitored.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest should be
weakening by Sunday, though some lingering moderate to locally
heavy rainfall will remain possible across the Olympic Peninsula
and far northern Cascades. Relatively light precipitation is
likely to continue there through Monday before another increase in
moisture brings another round of moderate to locally heavy
precipitation to western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday,
which may be mostly rain but with some uncertainty in snow levels
at this point. Light precipitation should spill into the Northern
Rockies as well. Northwesterly flow across the Great Lakes should
continue to support periodic lake effect/enhanced snowfall while
upper level-energy brings waves of light precipitation across the
Midwest to interior Northeast. Downwind of Lake Erie is expected
to be a focus for lake effect snow Sunday-Monday while Lake
Ontario could be a focus later in the week. Given the eastern
trend of the Atlantic low for this model cycle, less precipitation
is shown for New England early in the week, but light rain and
snow could still wrap around the low onshore. Elsewhere, the
contiguous U.S. should remain mostly dry, other than some early
week showers for Florida and increasing moisture for Texas midweek
onward.

The mean trough over the East should keep temperatures slightly
below normal into Tuesday with some moderation back towards normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Meanwhile, upper level ridging keeps
conditions warm throughout the West and central U.S. the entire
period, with a handful of both record highs and warm overnight
lows possible. The greatest anomalies should be across the
northern-central Plains where daytime highs could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. As the flow flattens during the late period,
above normal temperatures should also begin expanding into the
Midwest and South.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Mean troughing in the East will be reinforced several times by
shortwaves and maintained throughout much of the medium range
period (Sunday-Thursday). Elsewhere, an amplified ridge across the
West should weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into
the central U.S., which may also help to flatten the overall upper
pattern some by mid to later next week.

The guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for this
large scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in
the details. Energy reloading through the western side of the
trough in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show some slight
timing and magnitude differences, which would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The 00Z/06Z model cycle trended
a bit eastward with the surface low away from the coast compared
to the previous model cycle and WPC forecast, which was generally
maintained with the incoming 12Z models. Guidance was fairly well
clustered with the low position with the main exception of the
UKMET, which has been slower and farther south. Shortwaves moving
through the trough in the East and their potential spinups into
closed lows within the mean trough, as well as the fate of
shortwaves tracking through the eastern Pacific, become less
agreeable in deterministic guidance as the period progresses from
Tuesday onward, with no particularly clear solution at this point.
Though one seemingly clear outlier was the 00Z CMC, which showed a

...Developing storm system to produce heavy snow and gusty winds
across portions of the Interior Northeast and Northern New England
beginning early on Friday...

...Atmospheric River to generate moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the
Pacific Northwest tonight and again on Saturday...

...Strong Santa Ana wind event to cause threatening fire weather
conditions and destructive wind gusts through the end of the
week...

The primary weather maker this Thanksgiving and succeeding Black
Friday is associated with an area of low pressure tracking through
the Upper Great Lakes. Its trailing cold front is causing numerous
showers to develop from the Great Lakes and Mid-South to the
western Gulf Coast. In fact, South Texas may experience a few
thunderstorms capable of producing locally heavy rain tonight. By
Friday morning, showers are forecast to reach the East Coast while
colder temperatures funneling behind the cold front initiate lake
effect snow bands across parts of the eastern Great Lakes and into
the interior northern Mid-Atlantic. This storm system is set to
strengthen quickly during the day Friday as an upper level low
deepens over the Northeast. On the northern side of this upper
low, periods of snow are expected with the heaviest totals taking
shape over northern New England. Latest forecast totals show over
six inches of snow in the Adirondacks, with as much as a foot
possible in the Green and White Mountains. Travelers in northern
New England may contend with icy and treacherous conditions,
especially on untreated surfaces late Friday into Saturday
morning. Gusty winds will also accompany the system, particularly
between Friday night and Saturday, which could lead to reduced
visibility due to blowing snow. Winter Storm Watches have been
issued from northern New York State to northern Maine.

In the West, a new Atmospheric River containing rich subtropical
Pacific moisture takes aim at the Pacific Northwest this evening.
A prolonged stretch of moderate-to-heavy rainfall combined with
rapid snow melt could lead to excess runoff. This may result in
quickly rising creeks and streams, making localized flooding a
possibility in parts of western Washington. Locally heavy rainfall
is also possible in far northwestern Oregon, but the heaviest
rainfall totals (1 to 3 inches) are most likely to occur in the
Olympics and northern Cascades. High pressure building in atop the
Northwest on Friday will provide a brief break in the action, but
another round of heavy rain arrives late Saturday. This next
Atmospheric River event is expected to produce an additional 1 to
3 inches of rain across the Olympics and northern Cascades
beginning Saturday afternoon, with locally higher amounts
possible. Given the recent periods of heavy rainfall, flooding and
excessive runoff will undoubtedly be a concern once again.

In contrast to their neighbors in the Northwest, residents in
Southern California are dealing with dry Santa Ana winds. High
Wind Warnings have been posted along the mountain ranges, as well
as coastal regions. Widespread wind gusts of 35 to 60 mph are
expected with damaging gusts up to 75 mph possible in the
mountains and foothills. In addition, dangerously low humidity
levels support a hazardous environment for fire weather
conditions. Red Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk for hazardous
fire weather conditions, issued by the Storm Prediction Center,
were issued for much of the Southern California mountains and
adjacent foothills. The Santa Ana wind event this afternoon should
wind down to an extent by tonight, but an Elevated Risk for
favorable fire weather conditions looks to persist into Black
Friday. Temperature-wise, a cold front is set to usher in yet
another shot of cold Canadian air on Friday throughout the East.
December-like temperatures look to stick around in the
Mid-Atlantic and New England on Saturday. Meanwhile, a building
upper level ridge over the western third of the Lower 48 means
temperatures will warm-up incrementally each day to close out the
week and into the upcoming weekend.

FOR FRIDAY DECEMBER 03 - THURSDAY DECEMBER 09: Models are in above-average
agreement on the mean pattern for the week-2 period as a whole, but there
remains run-to-run and model-to-model inconsistency in the timing and
placement
of specific transient features. For this reason, no hazard was given more t=

a slight chance of occurring. Almost all models approximately agree on a
pattern featuring a weak mid-level ridge in the western CONUS and the south=
ern
half of the Plains while near or slightly below-normal 500-hPa heights cove=
r
the East. Beyond the CONUS, models concur that a negative phase of the NAO
will
be in place for most or all of week-2, which will leave moderate negative
500-hPa height anomalies across Canada, eastern Alaska, and the Davis Strai=
t.
Meanwhile, a strong mid-level ridge should form in the northern Atlantic,
south
of the subnormal height anomalies closer to the poles. This is a classic
feature of the negative phase of the NAO, and models are in excellent
agreement
on this feature. A moderate to strong mean ridge and significant positive
500-hPa height anomalies will also set up over the northern Pacific Ocean.
This
mean pattern is representative of a fairly progressive weather pattern acro=
ss
the country. Unusually mild temperatures are expected for the western
two-thirds of the CONUS, but there is no consistent model agreement farther
east. Tools overall don't favor particularly warm or cold weather for the
period, but it looks like conditions will be changeable, with mid-level
troughs
dropping south from eastern Canada, producing 1- or 2-day-long periods of c=
old
weather, followed by significant warming.

Two of these transient cold air masses could affect the CONUS. Cold, wintry
weather should be over New England early week-2, but surface high pressure
sliding off the East Coast will bring much milder air into the region. In t=
he
Southeast, a mid-week Canadian surface high pressure will drag another batc=

of
cold air southward from Canada. As this high pressure settles briefly over =
the
Southeast, nighttime temperatures could drop below freezing across Georgia =
and
northern Florida, and readings as low as 40 deg. F could filter into the
central Florida Peninsula. The western sections of Alaska will also be
affected
by a brief cold spell early week-2 along the western coastal areas and over
interior southwestern portions of the state before the strengthening ridge
over
the northern Pacific moderates temperatures for the rest of week-2.

Stormy weather is anticipated by most models along central and northern
sections of the Far West, but there are substantial differences in the timi=
ng,
strength, and evolution of individual features. But model consensus puts th=
e
best chances for storminess in the west-central CONUS. There is an elevated
chance for strong winds in this area around the middle of week-2 - especial=

0137 PM CST Thu Nov 25 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

Critical highlights were added to portions of the Ventura Valley,
extending to the San Gabriel Mountains in southern California,
mainly for tomorrow morning into early afternoon. Latest
high-resolution guidance consensus continues to indicate poor RH
recovery late tonight into Friday morning. However, despite the
weakening surface pressure gradient and departing upper support,
more widespread and longer lasting 20+ mph sustained northeasterly
surface winds will be more prevalent than previously expected, hence
the upgrade.

Elevated highlights were added to southeast Wyoming into parts of
the Nebraska Panhandle for tomorrow afternoon. Similar to today,
cool, but very dry and windy downslope flow is likely, with 20-30
mph sustained westerly surface winds overlapping with 15-20% RH
likely by afternoon peak heating. Consideration was given to adding
Critical highlights, but the cooler temperatures and modestly dry
fuels may limit a more robust wildfire-spread threat to a degree.
Conditions will be monitored for the need of Critical highlights in
future Day 1 Fire Weather Outlooks.

As a cold front sweeps across the Southeast, relatively drier
low-level air will overspread portions of the Florida Panhandle to
southern South Carolina as surface high pressure ushers in from the
northwest. Several guidance members depict RH dropping below 35%,
with a subset of these members showing 20-25% RH by afternoon peak
heating. However, northwesterly surface winds will struggle to
sustain above 10 mph in most locales, and a slight chance of modest,
preceding accumulating rainfall does exist. As such, Elevated
highlights have been withheld for now, but may be necessary in
future Day 1 Fire Weather outlooks if guidance consensus trends
windier, and forecast precipitation accumulations remain negligible.

..Squitieri.. 11/25/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CST Thu Nov 25 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed mid-level low over portions of the Baja Peninsula will lift
northeast and begin to merge with the broader jet stream, over
portions of the Southwest. Meanwhile, west-northwesterly mid-level
flow will remain positioned over the Pacific Northwest into the
northern Rockies. High pressure over the Great Basin region will
continue to weaken throughout the period.

...Portions of Southern California...
As the surface pressure gradient continues to weaken, offshore winds
will continue to subside throughout the day. Despite this trend,
sustained winds near 15 mph, along with higher gusts in
terrain-favored locations, should be possible. Dry conditions will
prevail, with RH values into the teens and single digits coinciding
with receptive fuels. Thus, elevated fire-weather conditions remain
likely for the region.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Dry/breezy conditions will be possible again during the afternoon in
response to diurnally driven mixing processes and persistent
marginally enhanced westerly flow aloft. Elevated fire-weather
conditions appear possible, but too localized to warrant any
highlights at this time.

300 PM EST Thu November 25 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 01 - 05 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging near the western Aleutians is forecast, leading to anticipat=
ed
troughing downstream across Alaska. Anomalous ridging is likely farther to =
the
south across the western and central CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted alo=
ng
the Eastern Seaboard with below normal 500-hPa heights over the Northeast.

Troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across most of the state. Ridging over the western and central
CONUS in the period favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast to
the
Mississippi Valley. Conversely, troughing over the Eastern Seaboard leads t=
o
increased chances of below normal temperatures for the Northeast and Florid=
a
Peninsula.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above-normal
precipitation for parts of the Northwest extending to the Northern Rockies =
and
Northern Plains. Ridging and surface high pressure are expected in the peri=
od
across much of the remainder of the CONUS, favoring below normal
precipitation.
Above normal precipitation is likely for eastern Alaska, ahead of a mean
surface low pressure predicted over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow to th=
e
northwest of this low leads to increased chances of below normal precipitat=
ion
across western Alaska.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed
on Day 8, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to a
good
agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the period=
,
offset by substantially increased uncertainty later in the period associate=
d
with a potential pattern change.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 03 - 09 2021

The potential for a pattern change and associated substantial uncertainty
exists for the week-2 period. The AO and NAO indices are both forecast by t=
he
GEFS to switch from negative to positive. In the period, agreement is fairl=
y
good among the models with troughs predicted across Alaska and the
northeastern
CONUS, and ridging forecast from the southwestern CONUS to the Great Plains=
.
Models are in agreement on a general de-amplification of the overall patter=
n
by
the end of the period. With this de-amplification, enhanced Pacific Flow is
forecast to become more dominant across much of the West Coast. Upstream,
troughing over Alaska is expected to weaken and push eastward by the end of
week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast to persist into
week-2 for most of Alaska. Ridging and a general low-amplitude pattern
thereafter, leads to increased chances of above-normal temperatures across
most
of the CONUS. Below normal temperatures are favored for the Florida Peninsu=
la,
as a trough predicted over the Eastern Seaboard early in the period pushes
offshore.

As the overall pattern transitions to a more zonal orientation, enhanced
Pacific Flow is increasingly likely across much of the Northwest Coast.
Additionally, teleconnections from an upstream ridge predicted near the
western
Aleutians presents a very strong wet signal across much of the West Coast. =
Due
to these factors, above normal precipitation is favored across the West Coa=
st
eastward to parts of the Northern Rockies. Below normal precipitation is
favored in parts of  the Southern Rockies, Great Plains and Mississippi
Valley,
due primarily to the ridging forecast. Below normal precipitation is favore=
d
for western Alaska behind of the departing trough. A wet pattern is likely =
for
eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle in association with the
troughing over the Gulf of Alaska.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
the potential for a significant pattern change during the period and
associated
substantial model disagreements.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Mean troughing in the East will be reinforced several times by
shortwaves and maintained throughout much of the medium range
period (Sunday-Thursday). Elsewhere, an amplified ridge across the
West should weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into
the central U.S., which may also help to flatten the overall upper
pattern some by mid to later next week.

The guidance continues to show reasonably good agreement for this
large scale flow pattern but offers plenty of uncertainty still in
the details. Energy reloading through the western side of the
trough in the East on Sunday-Monday continues to show some slight
timing and magnitude differences, which would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The 00Z/06Z model cycle trended
a bit eastward with the surface low away from the coast compared
to the previous model cycle and WPC forecast, which was generally
maintained with the incoming 12Z models. Guidance was fairly well
clustered with the low position with the main exception of the
UKMET, which has been slower and farther south. Shortwaves moving
through the trough in the East and their potential spinups into
closed lows within the mean trough, as well as the fate of
shortwaves tracking through the eastern Pacific, become less
agreeable in deterministic guidance as the period progresses from
Tuesday onward, with no particularly clear solution at this point.
Though one seemingly clear outlier was the 00Z CMC, which showed a
strong shortwave moving into the West diving south to meet up with
energy over northern Mexico to create a closed low differently
than consensus.

Thus, the WPC forecast began with a blend of the 00Z/06Z GFS,
ECMWF, and CMC, gradually transitioning to a blend that favored
the GEFS and EC ensemble means (along with some component of the
EC and GFS) by around midweek to minimize individual model
differences. Overall this maintained good continuity with the
previous forecast, with the main change the aforementioned shift
of the Atlantic low and its associated precipitation a bit
eastward for this cycle, but will continue to be monitored.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

The atmospheric river into the Pacific Northwest should be
weakening by Sunday, though some lingering moderate to locally
heavy rainfall will remain possible across the Olympic Peninsula
and far northern Cascades. Relatively light precipitation is
likely to continue there through Monday before another increase in
moisture brings another round of moderate to locally heavy
precipitation to western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday,
which may be mostly rain but with some uncertainty in snow levels
at this point. Light precipitation should spill into the Northern
Rockies as well. Northwesterly flow across the Great Lakes should
continue to support periodic lake effect/enhanced snowfall while
upper level-energy brings waves of light precipitation across the
Midwest to interior Northeast. Downwind of Lake Erie is expected
to be a focus for lake effect snow Sunday-Monday while Lake
Ontario could be a focus later in the week. Given the eastern
trend of the Atlantic low for this model cycle, less precipitation
is shown for New England early in the week, but light rain and
snow could still wrap around the low onshore. Elsewhere, the
contiguous U.S. should remain mostly dry, other than some early
week showers for Florida and increasing moisture for Texas midweek
onward.

The mean trough over the East should keep temperatures slightly
below normal into Tuesday with some moderation back towards normal
Wednesday and Thursday. Meanwhile, upper level ridging keeps
conditions warm throughout the West and central U.S. the entire
period, with a handful of both record highs and warm overnight
lows possible. The greatest anomalies should be across the
northern-central Plains where daytime highs could be 20 to 30
degrees above normal. As the flow flattens during the late period,
above normal temperatures should also begin expanding into the
Midwest and South.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 AM CST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 261200Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA...

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low over portions of the Baja Peninsula will lift
northeast throughout the day and begin merging with a broad
upper-level trough positioned over the central CONUS. At the
surface, high pressure over the Great Basin region will continue a
weakening trend.

...Southern California...
Elevated to critical fire-weather conditions will be ongoing this
morning and should persist into the afternoon. Despite weakening
high pressure over the Great Basin, the regional pressure gradient
should still favor offshore surface winds sustained near 20 mph,
with locally higher gusts in terrain-favored locations. Wind speeds
during the afternoon may continue support elevated to critical
conditions with at least modestly enhanced northeasterly flow aloft
(along the western periphery of the cutoff low) remaining over the
region. Very dry conditions will prevail, with RH values starting in
the teens and dropping into the single digits by early afternoon.
Likewise, fuels remain largely receptive to large-fire spread. The
fire-weather threat should begin to decrease somewhat by late
evening as winds relax, however, very dry conditions will remain
present and likely support at least elevated conditions through the
end of the period.

...Southeastern Wyoming and the Southwestern Nebraska Panhandle...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will be possible during the
afternoon, as modestly enhanced mid-level flow is mixed toward the
surface coupled with downsloping/compressional heating effects.
These processes should yield sustained winds near 20-25 mph and RH
values into the upper teens amid receptive fuels.

...Portions of the Southeast...
Dry post-frontal northwesterly flow will overspread the region
today, resulting in the potential for locally elevated fire-weather
conditions. Despite RH values falling to near 30% during the
afternoon, sustained winds should remain relatively light, perhaps
near 10-15 mph, and fuels appear marginally receptive to large-fire
spread. Thus, no highlights have been introduced for the region at
this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 AM CST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

...Synopsis...
A cutoff mid-level low over portions of the Southwest will continue
lifting northeast and merge with a large-scale upper-level trough
over the central/eastern CONUS. Meanwhile, an upper-level ridge will
build into the West. At the surface, weak high pressure should
remain present over the Great Basin region.

...Portions of Southern California...
Elevated fire-weather conditions will likely be ongoing at the start
of the period and persist for at least a few hours during the
morning. Thereafter, winds are forecast to relax substantially as
the offshore pressure gradient weakens, although dry conditions
(e.g., RH values into the single digits) will persist for much of
the day. Given the early day threat, an elevated area has been added
for the region.

...Portions of the Southern High Plains...
Dry/breezy post-frontal winds may yield potential for locally
elevated conditions across parts of the region during the afternoon.
Timing, and thus position, of the frontal boundary remains a bit
uncertain, but presently the most likely area for such conditions to
develop appears to be in northeast New Mexico and the OK/TX
Panhandles. Should the forecast position of the frontal boundary
improve, an elevated delineation may be needed for the region in
forthcoming outlooks.

212 AM EST Fri Nov 26 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Nov 29 2021 - 12Z Fri Dec 03 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Though one seemingly clear outlier was the 00Z

Multiple shortwaves will track across the CONUS during the
extended period; which will reinforce the mean trough over the
eastern U.S. Over the West, an amplified ridge will begin to
weaken as a couple of shortwaves move through and into the central
U.S., which may also help to flatten the overall upper pattern
some by mid to later next week.

Generally speaking, the global guidance and the ensemble means
have a fair handle on the evolution of this pattern albeit with
uncertainty in the specific details. The impulses moving across
the northern U.S. and Great Lakes regions pose timing and
magnitude differences that essentially would affect a surface low
deepening off the Northeast coast. The guidance is favoring an
eastern shift as the surface low skirts near the New England
coast. Once again the UKMET is positioned notably south of the
rest of the clustered guidance and was also as much as 10 mb
deeper with the low tracking across the Canadian Prairies/Northern
tier U.S. Therefore was considered an outlier for this issuance.
As noted in the previous forecast, the CMC which showed a strong
shortwave moving into the West diving south to meet up with energy
over northern Mexico to create a closed low differently than
consensus. The CMC was usable in the initial periods.

The WPC blend utilized a combination of the 12/18Z GFS, ECWMF and
CMC as a starting point then gradually ceasing use of the CMC
while increasing the inclusion of the GEFS and ECWMF means. This
approach helped maintain a degree of continuity as well as
minimizing individual model differences.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Remnant moisture from the weakening atmospheric river will keep
lingering moderate to locally heavy rainfall possible for the
Olympic Peninsula, far northern Cascades and the surrounding areas.
Relatively light precipitation is likely to continue for this
region through Monday before another increase in moisture brings
another round of moderate to locally heavy precipitation to
western Washington around Tuesday-Wednesday, which may be mostly
rain but with some uncertainty in snow levels at this point.
Portions of the Northern Rockies is also expected to have light
precipitation with this flow.

Periodic lake effect snow/enhanced snowfall is expected for the
Great Lakes regions through the extended period as northwesterly
flow passes across the open lakes. A favored locations downwind of
Lake Erie will likely observe enhancements through Monday while
areas downwind of Lake Ontario are anticipated later in the week.
In addition to the lake effect snows, parts of the Midwest and the
Northeast will have light precipitation as energy passes aloft.
Models have been trending down for the QPF amounts over New
England that past few runs. Although there are differences in the
location of the Atlantic Low, the possibility of flow wrapping
into the low onshore could yield light rain or snowfall. Other
than the two highlighted region, a majority of the country will be
generally dry other than some early week showers for Florida and
increasing moisture for Texas midweek onward.

Temperatures will generally be slightly below normal across the
Eastern U.S. as the mean trough becomes reinforced, with some
moderation back towards normal Wednesday and Thursday. Much of the
West and central states will maintain warmth through the extended
forecast thanks to the ridging over the region. A few locations
may reach or exceed daily maximum and minimum temperature records,
where some places could register 20 to 30 degrees above seasonal
average. As the flow flattens during the late period, above normal
temperatures should also begin expanding into the Midwest and
South.

...Developing storm system to produce heavy snow and gusty winds
across portions of the Interior Northeast and Northern New England
through Saturday morning...

...Atmospheric River to generate moderate-to-heavy rainfall in the
Pacific Northwest on Saturday...

...Strong Santa Ana wind event to cause threatening fire weather
conditions and destructive wind gusts through the end of the
week...

A pair of succeeding low pressure systems will bring wintry
weather and wind to the Great Lakes over the next couple of days.
The first in this series of systems will is currently underway and
is forecast to end by Saturday morning. Winds will continue on the
backside of this system, which means that blowing snow may become
a hazard today and into tonight. Lake effect and orographic
enhancement over the interior Northeast may contribute to snow
totals reaching between 4-8 inches with isolated higher amounts
when all is said and done. The highest snowfall totals are
forecast for portions of the Adirondacks and northern New England.
An Alberta Clipper is likely to arrive over the Upper Great Lakes
by Saturday night, bringing with it the chance for light snowfall
to the region through Sunday. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings
and Winter Weather Advisories are in effect for portions of
upstate northern New York through northern New England.

In the West, as one Atmospheric River event winds down today,
another round of heavy rain arrives tomorrow. This next
Atmospheric River event is expected to produce an additional 3 to
6 inches of rain across the Olympics and northern Cascades
beginning Saturday afternoon, with locally higher amounts
possible. Given the recent periods of heavy rainfall, flooding and
excessive runoff will undoubtedly be a concern once again.
Meanwhile, a low pressure system in the Gulf of Mexico will
produce light to moderate rainfall for much of coastal/central
Texas and the Lower Mississippi Valley on Saturday. Most of this
precipitation is likely to move offshore by Sunday.

In contrast to their neighbors in the Northwest, residents in
Southern California are dealing with dry Santa Ana winds. High
Wind Warnings have been posted along the mountain ranges, as well
as coastal regions. Widespread wind gusts of 35 to 60 mph are
expected with damaging gusts up to 75 mph possible in the
mountains and foothills. In addition, dangerously low humidity
levels support a hazardous environment for fire weather
conditions. Red Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk for hazardous
fire weather conditions, issued by the Storm Prediction Center,
were issued for much of the Southern California mountains and
adjacent foothills. The Santa Ana wind event this afternoon should
continue weakening today, but an Elevated Risk for favorable fire
weather conditions looks to persist into Black Friday.
Temperature-wise, a cold front is set to usher in yet another shot
of cold Canadian air across the East today. December-like
temperatures look to stick around in the Mid-Atlantic and New
England on Saturday. Meanwhile, a building upper-level ridge over
the western third of the Lower 48 means temperatures will warm-up
incrementally each day through the weekend.

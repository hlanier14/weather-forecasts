...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...PORTIONS
OF THE OKLAHOMA/TEXAS PANHANDLES...AND WESTERN KANSAS...

Morning observations indicate an impressively dry airmass this
morning across New Mexico, with dewpoints already in the single
digits and even below zero in a few areas.  Over time, this airmass
will spread downstream into the Panhandles and western Kansas, while
mixing processes increase surface wind speeds into the 25-35 mph
range.  This will result in areas of critical fire weather in many
areas especially where fuels are dry.  The critical area has been
updated to highlight the axis of strongest surface winds and lowest
RH (from central NM through western Kansas), though areas in the
elevated delineation may also experience briefly critical
fire-weather at times through the afternoon.

An elevated fire weather area was also added to portions of
southeastern New Mexico (near Chaves County) where very dry air (15%
RH) was already noted.  Though surface winds may be slightly weaker
here compared to areas north and west, single digit RH values will
become common later this afternoon.

The remainder of the outlook is unchanged.  See the previous
discussion below for more information.

..Cook.. 02/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CST Sat Feb 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
...Southern High Plains...
Lee cyclogenesis is ongoing in southeast Colorado with southwesterly
flow starting to strengthen across the southern High Plains. These
winds are expected to strengthen through the day as the pressure
gradient tightens and as deep mixing transports stronger mid-level
flow toward the surface. A broad area of 20 to 25 mph winds are
expected across much of the southern High Plains with the strongest
winds approaching 30 mph in northern New Mexico into the Oklahoma
Panhandle.

In addition, dewpoints are already in the single digits across much
of New Mexico, and this dry air will spread east into the TX/OK
Panhandles this afternoon. This combination of windy and very dry
conditions will lead to a broad area of elevated conditions in much
of the southern High Plains. Fuels in southwest Kansas are not that
dry, but given the strength of the winds and the dry air mass, rapid
drying of 1-hour fuels is expected to provide enough dry fuels for
some risk of fire spread.

Added a critical area along the New Mexico border from far southeast
Colorado to Parmer County, Texas. In this area, the aforementioned
meteorological conditions are expected, and fuels are drier than
elsewhere. There have been fires reported earlier this week and
fuels have dried significantly since then. Therefore, a critical
delineation is warranted.

...Southern California...
Very strong offshore winds are expected across much of southern
California starting early Sunday morning as an offshore pressure
gradient combines with upper-level support. Dry fuels and relative
humidity will be in place, but cool conditions are expected with
temperatures in the 20s to 30s expected in many of the mountain
areas. Therefore, an elevated delineation was added as wind and
relative humidity support fire spread, but cool temperatures should
temper the overall threat.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FAR SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA AND FAR
SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO...

Elevated and critical delineations were added to the outlook across
southern Arizona, southern New Mexico, and far west Texas for this
update.  Recent model guidance suggests that a very dry airmass will
reside in the region, with very low dewpoints contributing to
single-digit RH values during peak heating hours as surface
temperatures rise into the 50s F.  An advancing mid-level trough
over northern Arizona will amplify flow aloft over the region, with
vertical mixing processes resulting in 20-30 mph surface winds (with
higher gusts).  This dry airmass will extend eastward into west
Texas, though models are a bit less consistent on critically strong
wind speeds in far west Texas and southeastern New Mexico.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Sat Feb 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected to be ongoing across
southern California at the start of the period. These conditions
should persist for much of the day before the offshore pressure
gradient relaxes by evening and fire weather concerns are expected
to wane. Strong winds and dry conditions are expected, but cold
temperatures are expected to temper the overall threat.

...Heavy rain threat shifting eastward into the Southeast on
Tuesday before diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Since the ECMWF shifted toward the general GFS/GEFS scenario of
forming a closed low off California by the start of the period,
global models and ensembles have been showing indications of
converging toward a common solution on forecasting the pattern
evolution across the eastern two-thirds of the country for the
latter part of next week.  There are still plenty of forecast
uncertainties yet to be resolved.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging
to note that the GFS has now defaulted into the typically faster
solution cluster versus the typically slower ECMWF.  The better
model agreement therefore has increased the confidence for the
upper low to track across the Southwest on Wednesday into Thursday
followed by an increasing chance for cyclogenesis to occur over
the southern Plains.  There is also a general model trend of
tracking this system closer along the Gulf Coast later next week
instead of the early GFS idea of a much more inland track.  The
latest (12Z) ECMWF now shows a faster forward motion of the upper
low, which is another encouraging sign that the model solutions
are converging.  Meanwhile, the CMC offers a more suppressed
solution which keeps the system more as an open wave while
tracking east across the northern Gulf.

Otherwise, for the first half of the period, the GFS cluster takes
the rain faster eastward across the Deep South into the Southeast.
 The GEFS mean and EC mean show a better agreement.  Along the
West Coast, a deep trough originated from a deep upper low in the
Gulf of Alaska is forecast to edge closer toward the coast by the
end of next week.  There is a trend for the trough to arrive
earlier than previous forecasts.

New 00Z guidance thus far maintains support for the non-GFS
cluster from the Plains into the East early in the period while
the UKMET/CMC are consolidating close to the 12Z ECMWF for the
upper low tracking into the Southwest in contrast to the GFS that
has trended even faster than its 18Z runs.  The new ECMWF becomes
just a bit faster than its 12Z run.  Later in the period over the
East, the new CMC/ECMWF still support the established non-GFS
cluster for the overall pattern though the ECMWF has hedged a bit
less suppressed than the prior run.  The new ECMWF also adjusted a
fraction faster with the late period trough nearing the West
Coast.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was derived based on a
multi-model consensus of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z
GFS/GEFS with smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean and
the 00Z NAEFS.  Beginning on Day 5, more of the 06Z GEFS together
with the 00Z EC mean were used to handle the increasing forecast
uncertainty.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The favored guidance consensus still shows the potential for
another episode of locally heavy rainfall over parts of the South
into Tuesday-Tuesday night.  Expect the upper low forecast to be
over the south-central Plains early Tuesday to open up as it
continues eastward, interacting with a front near the Gulf Coast
and supporting one or more frontal waves along with some inclusion
of Gulf moisture.  Lighter precipitation could reach as far north
as the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic.  Precise northward
extent and intensity of precipitation remains fairly uncertain but
a general southward trend has been noted.  The upper low closing
off to the west of California should bring moderate amounts of
moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Plains by mid-late week
(some snow possible at high elevations over the Four Corners
states), still with only moderate confidence for timing at best.
Confidence trends even lower for the northward extent of
precipitation over the eastern half of the country by late
week/weekend, given the differences in how much eastern U.S. upper
troughing develops in response to upstream amplification.  To the
east of the Rockies, with both systems there could be some wintry
weather in the northern fringe/higher elevations of the
precipitation shield if the moisture extends far enough north.
Over the Northwest/West Coast, precipitation should initially be
light to moderate and primarily over northern areas.  The upper
trough approaching the West Coast later in the week should bring
an increase and southward expansion of precipitation with a trend
for earlier arrival time.

The above normal temperatures expected over the Northern Plains
and vicinity through the period are one of the more consistent and
confident aspects of the forecast.  There should be decent
coverage of plus 10-20F anomalies for highs/morning lows most days
and some locations could see highs greater than 20F above average.
 Southern and eastern states will see a cool day Tuesday with the
East Coast most likely to see some highs 10-15F below normal,
followed by a rebound toward normal.  Locations near the East
Coast could see a cooling trend next weekend depending on how much
upper troughing develops.  The West will see a warming trend that
should support highs reaching 5-15F above normal by late in the
week.

...Heavy rain threat shifting eastward into the Southeast on
Tuesday before diminishing...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Since the ECMWF shifted toward the general GFS/GEFS scenario of
forming a closed low off California by the start of the period,
global models and ensembles have been showing indications of
converging toward a common solution on forecasting the pattern
evolution across the eastern two-thirds of the country for the
latter part of next week.  There are still plenty of forecast
uncertainties yet to be resolved.  Nevertheless, it is encouraging
to note that the GFS has now defaulted into the typically faster
solution cluster versus the typically slower ECMWF.  The better
model agreement therefore has increased the confidence for the
upper low to track across the Southwest on Wednesday into Thursday
followed by an increasing chance for cyclogenesis to occur over
the southern Plains.  There is also a general model trend of
tracking this system closer along the Gulf Coast later next week
instead of the early GFS idea of a much more inland track.  The
latest (12Z) ECMWF now shows a faster forward motion of the upper
low, which is another encouraging sign that the model solutions
are converging.  Meanwhile, the CMC offers a more suppressed
solution which keeps the system more as an open wave while
tracking east across the northern Gulf.

Otherwise, for the first half of the period, the GFS cluster takes
the rain faster eastward across the Deep South into the Southeast.

Gulf of Alaska is forecast to edge closer toward the coast by the

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat February 27 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:
19630313 - 19850302 - 19530303 - 19640307 - 19550308

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall from parts of the
Lower Mississippi Valley to the Central Appalachians/Ohio Valley
through Monday morning...

...Snow over the Upper Midwest into parts of the Northeast through
Monday evening...

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic to the Central Plains,
then westward to the Southwest will slowly move eastward to off
the East Coast by Monday.  Moisture pooling along the front will
help produce rain and thunderstorms from the Southern Plains to
the Southern Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, with rain extending from
Central/Southern Appalachians into the Mid-Atlantic through
Monday.

The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall from parts
of the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Central Appalachians/Ohio
Valley through Monday morning.  The heavy rain along the front
will produce scattered areas of flooding, with the most vulnerable
areas will be urban areas, roads, and small streams.  Isolated
areas of significant areas of flash flooding are possible from
Saturday evening into Monday morning.  In the meantime, a wave of
low pressure over the western end of the front will move from the
Southern Rockies into Mexico by Monday.  The wave will help
produce snow over parts of the Southern Rockies into the Panhandle
of Texas on Sunday afternoon into Monday afternoon.

Another front extending from the Upper Great Lakes to the Northern
Plains will slowly move eastward to the Northeast by Monday.
Light snow will develop along the Northern Plains boundary into
the Upper Great Lakes through Sunday evening.  Also, pockets of
rain/freezing rain will develop over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley.  Areas of rain will move into the Great Lakes
on Sunday afternoon into late Sunday night.  Also, overnight
Sunday rain will move into parts of the Northeast that will change
over to snow from west to east over the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley into the Northeast on Monday morning into Monday evening.
Along the rain/snow line, rain/freezing rain areas will develop
over parts of the Northern Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.

Meanwhile, an upper-level trough over the Northern/Central Rockies
will move eastward to the Upper Great Lakes to the Southern
Rockies by Sunday evening.   The energy will help produce light
snow over the Northern/Central Rockies on Saturday evening, ending
overnight.  Onshore flow will help produce coastal rain and higher
elevation snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest through early
Monday morning.  On Monday, a front will approach the Pacific
Northwest and start to move inland by Monday evening.

Elsewhere, fire weather is a concern across portions of the
Southern High Plains and Red Flag Warnings are in place there.
Gusty winds are possible in the southwestern U.S. and parts of
California in particular, so scattered Wind Advisories and High
Wind Watches are in effect on Saturday evening into Sunday morning.

158 AM EST Sun Feb 28 2021

Valid 12Z Wed Mar 03 2021 - 12Z Sun Mar 07 2021

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

At least through the 12Z/18Z cycles, guidance was showing some
favorable converging trends with respect to the evolution of an
upper low that forms offshore California during the short range
and then progresses inland, along with how developing eastern U.S.
upper troughing will eventually influence what remains of this
feature later in the period.  At the same time the models and
means have consolidated fairly well for the upper trough
amplifying off the West Coast into early Friday, but then continue
to diverge with specifics of the leading shortwave as an upstream
feature amplifies into the overall mean trough next weekend.

Among data reviewed for this forecast the 18Z GFS and 12Z
ECMWF/CMC ended up clustering fairly well for the upper low
tracking through the Southwest and into the Plains.  The 18Z GFS
represented a slower trend from the 12Z run.  The 12Z UKMET was
the slow extreme.  The 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their means also
provided a decent basis for the preferred blend for eastern U.S.
upper trough that develops in response to the upstream pattern and
ultimately suppresses the Southwest/Plains system toward the Gulf
Coast before strengthening it over the western Atlantic next
weekend.  At the moment it looks like a close call regarding how
much of an effect this system may have along central and northern
parts of the East Coast but with greater likelihood of minimal
influence.  Specifics of this system by then will depend on exact
details of northern stream trough energy which so far has differed
among guidance and consecutive runs.  Convergence for the eastern
U.S. and vicinity has been by way of the GFS trending more
amplified with the eastern trough and the ECMWF backing off from
its prior depth somewhat.

As upper troughing amplifies off the West Coast mid-late week,
latest consensus represents an eastward trend in the ECMWF over
the past couple days and slightly slower adjustment in the GFS.
Then after early Friday the GFS/GEFS mean have consistently been
ejecting the leading shortwave quickly inland as upstream energy
drops into the mean trough, in contrast to the much slower and
more amplified/sharper ECMWF.  The 12Z CMC was a compromise though
on the fast side with the upstream feature.  Some aspects of each
solution could have some merit.  Typical GFS biases suggest it
could be too fast but at that time frame there has been a modest
faster trend with this feature in most guidance recently.  Also
the idea of a flatter shortwave ejecting into the downstream ridge
could have some merit versus the ECMWF/ECMWF mean that bring more
height falls into the ridge.  Thus a blended approach seems best
for the purposes of a single deterministic forecast.

New 00Z model runs seem to continue the theme of volatility from
recent days.  The GFS/CMC/ECMWF have all trended westward with the
upper low offshore California, joining the UKMET.  The 00Z cluster
remains slower than the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS as the system tracks
through the Southwest but gradually catches up over the Plains on
Friday.  However this slower trend is enough to lead to a more
suppressed surface pattern farther eastward as the eastern upper
trough has more time to amplify.  Meanwhile solutions have
remained in their respective clusters near the West Coast during
the latter half of the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

On Wednesday expect precipitation over the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic to taper off as a wave initially along the
southeastern coast continues into the Atlantic.  Some rainfall
could still be locally heavy early in the day depending on timing
of this system.  The upper low closing off to the west of
California during the short range period should move through the
Southwest and into the Plains during the latter half of the week.
This system will bring some rain into parts of southern California
and rain/higher elevation snow to portions of the Southwest and
southern Rockies.  Then rainfall over the Plains (possibly
moderate to heavy in places) should stay suppressed at least as
far south as the southeastern quadrant of the lower 48 as the
surface system drops toward the Gulf Coast or even into the Gulf,
possibly continuing over the western Atlantic.  Confidence is
improving for the general path of the upper low through the
Southwest into the Plains but timing is still a question.  However
confidence remains lower than desired for precipitation coverage
and intensity over the eastern half of the country due to the
combined uncertainties of the upper low's timing and relation to
the upper trough that develops over the East.  00Z model trends
toward slower upper low timing could allow for sufficient eastern
U.S. trough amplitude to prevent most of the moisture from
extending eastward from the Plains.  Currently expect most effects
to remain offshore the East Coast if low pressure develops over
the western Atlantic next weekend.

Precipitation ahead of the amplifying eastern Pacific trough aloft
will initially focus primarily over Vancouver Island and into the
Olympics, with some moderate to heavy totals possible.  Expect
rain and mountain snow of varying intensity to extend southward to
the central West Coast by late week and the weekend.  Some light
precipitation will be possible at times during the period over the
northern Rockies, and possibly over parts of the Interior
West/central Rockies next weekend depending on the details of
shortwave energy aloft.

The forecast is very consistent in showing above normal
temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity through the
period, with decent coverage of plus 10-25F anomalies for highs
and plus 10-20F anomalies for morning lows.  Gradual amplification
of the large scale pattern will bring a warming trend to the West.
 The warmest days should be around Friday-Saturday with the Great
Basin the most likely to see readings up to 10-15F above normal.
On the other hand areas near the East Coast will see a cooling
trend that could bring highs down to 5-15F below normal by next
weekend.

U.S. and vicinity has been by way of the GFS trending more
amplified with the eastern trough and the ECMWF backing off from
its prior depth somewhat.

As upper troughing amplifies off the West Coast mid-late week,
latest consensus represents an eastward trend in the ECMWF over
the past couple days and slightly slower adjustment in the GFS.
Then after early Friday the GFS/GEFS mean have consistently been
ejecting the leading shortwave quickly inland as upstream energy
drops into the mean trough, in contrast to the much slower and
more amplified/sharper ECMWF.  The 12Z CMC was a compromise though
on the fast side with the upstream feature.  Some aspects of each
solution could have some merit.  Typical GFS biases suggest it
could be too fast but at that time frame there has been a modest
faster trend with this feature in most guidance recently.  Also
the idea of a flatter shortwave ejecting into the downstream ridge
could have some merit versus the ECMWF/ECMWF mean that bring more
height falls into the ridge.  Thus a blended approach seems best
for the purposes of a single deterministic forecast.

New 00Z model runs seem to continue the theme of volatility from
recent days.  The GFS/CMC/ECMWF have all trended westward with the
upper low offshore California, joining the UKMET.  The 00Z cluster
remains slower than the 12Z ECMWF/18Z GFS as the system tracks
through the Southwest but gradually catches up over the Plains on
Friday.  However this slower trend is enough to lead to a more
suppressed surface pattern farther eastward as the eastern upper
trough has more time to amplify.  Meanwhile solutions have
remained in their respective clusters near the West Coast during
the latter half of the period.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

On Wednesday expect precipitation over the Southeast/southern
Mid-Atlantic to taper off as a wave initially along the
southeastern coast continues into the Atlantic.  Some rainfall
could still be locally heavy early in the day depending on timing
of this system.  The upper low closing off to the west of
California during the short range period should move through the
Southwest and into the Plains during the latter half of the week.
This system will bring some rain into parts of southern California
and rain/higher elevation snow to portions of the Southwest and
southern Rockies.  Then rainfall over the Plains (possibly
moderate to heavy in places) should stay suppressed at least as
far south as the southeastern quadrant of the lower 48 as the
surface system drops toward the Gulf Coast or even into the Gulf,
possibly continuing over the western Atlantic.  Confidence is
improving for the general path of the upper low through the
Southwest into the Plains but timing is still a question.  However
confidence remains lower than desired for precipitation coverage
and intensity over the eastern half of the country due to the
combined uncertainties of the upper low's timing and relation to
the upper trough that develops over the East.  00Z model trends
toward slower upper low timing could allow for sufficient eastern
U.S. trough amplitude to prevent most of the moisture from
extending eastward from the Plains.  Currently expect most effects
to remain offshore the East Coast if low pressure develops over
the western Atlantic next weekend.

Precipitation ahead of the amplifying eastern Pacific trough aloft
will initially focus primarily over Vancouver Island and into the
Olympics, with some moderate to heavy totals possible.  Expect
rain and mountain snow of varying intensity to extend southward to
the central West Coast by late week and the weekend.  Some light
precipitation will be possible at times during the period over the
northern Rockies, and possibly over parts of the Interior
West/central Rockies next weekend depending on the details of
shortwave energy aloft.

The forecast is very consistent in showing above normal
temperatures over the Northern Plains and vicinity through the
period, with decent coverage of plus 10-25F anomalies for highs
and plus 10-20F anomalies for morning lows.  Gradual amplification
of the large scale pattern will bring a warming trend to the West.
 The warmest days should be around Friday-Saturday with the Great
Basin the most likely to see readings up to 10-15F above normal.
On the other hand areas near the East Coast will see a cooling
trend that could bring highs down to 5-15F below normal by next
weekend.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST ARIZONA AND SOUTHWEST
NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
...Southwest...
Mid-level flow is expected to strengthen above 50 mph near the
confluence of Mexico, Arizona, and New Mexico by this afternoon.
Deep mixing is expected in the region, and thus, some of this
stronger flow is expected to be transported toward the surface. In
addition, the surface pressure gradient is expected to tighten as
low-pressure develops in southern New Mexico. As a result, winds are
expected to be around 25 mph with relative humidity around 5 to 10
percent.

...Southern California...
Offshore flow has started across southern California early this
morning, and is expected to strengthen substantially through
mid-morning as mid to upper level winds strengthen. While
temperatures will remain quite cool across the region, winds are
expected to be very strong and thus an elevated delineation is
warranted. Offshore flow is expected to continue through the day and
into tonight, but the strongest winds (and the majority of the fire
weather concerns) are expected to wane by late afternoon.

...Flash flooding and flooding are likely across portions of the
Tennessee and Ohio Valleys and Central Appalachians today and
tonight as a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall is in place...

...Severe weather is possible for the Ark-La-Tex into the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys...

...Some snow is possible across the Upper Midwest to Northeast
through Monday...

Another day of widespread rain and thunderstorms is expected for
portions of the central and eastern U.S., as ample moisture from
the Gulf of Mexico streams in ahead of a frontal system. Rainfall
amounts over an inch are possible stretching from the Lower
Mississippi Valley into the northern Mid-Atlantic, with rainfall
of 3+ inches possible in the Ohio Valley. Many of these areas have
received considerable rainfall over the last few days as well,
exacerbating the risk for flooding and flash flooding. A Moderate
Risk of excessive rainfall is in place for the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys into the Central Appalachians through tonight, while Flood
Watches are in effect as well. Severe weather is also a threat,
mainly just to the south of the main flash flooding axis, with a
Slight Risk of severe weather located across the Ark-La-Tex and
into parts of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys. The
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall stretches into these areas as
well. The southeastern quadrant of the country will be quite warm
especially today ahead of the front, and daily record high maximum
and minimum temperatures could be broken.

While rain and thunderstorms should clear out of the Ohio Valley
by Monday morning after the cold front passes, showers and
thunderstorms will continue Monday in the Gulf Coast states as the
front lingers there. Areas from eastern Texas into the Lower
Mississippi Valley could see some isolated flash flooding
concerns, but not nearly as widespread. Light precipitation could
fall in the form of snow or mixed precipitation in the Southern
Rockies and east into the Southern Plains on Monday, as
temperatures cool to below normal behind the front.

Farther north, snow is expected in the Upper Midwest to Upper
Great Lakes region today. An axis of 6 to 8 inches of snow is
forecast in northern Wisconsin into the U.P. of Michigan, and
Winter Weather Advisories are in effect there. Lighter snow could
again move through these regions tonight into early Monday.
Farther east, interior New England could see light mixed
precipitation or snow beginning this evening, with a round of snow
spreading across the Lower Great Lakes into the Northeast Monday
as a cold front passes through. Generally light amounts of snow
are forecast, but isolated areas could accumulate a few inches of
snow.

On the southern end of an upper-level trough over the West, gusty
winds are possible today for California into the Desert Southwest
and Southern High Plains. Scattered High Wind Warnings and Wind
Advisories are in effect, and the winds could cause elevated fire
danger as well, with Red Flag Warnings and a Critical Risk of fire
weather for southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico. This
trough should also lead to cooler than normal temperatures in the
Great Basin and Rockies today, moderating on Monday.

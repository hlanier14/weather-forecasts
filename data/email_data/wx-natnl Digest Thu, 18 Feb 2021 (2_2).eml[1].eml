...Active weather continues across the Pacific Northwest and
northern Rockies through the period...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation...

Progressive mean flow over most of the lower 48 will finally bring
an end to the record cold airmass that has plagued the Central
U.S. for several days. The pattern will also promote the
continuation of an active weather period for the Pacific Northwest
into next week with persistent onshore flow and a series of
shortwave troughs/impulses. The first trough should amplify
somewhat across the central U.S. by Sunday before continuing
through the East early next week (with associated surface system).
Then a strong jet reaching into the Northwest U.S. and western
Canada around the start of next week will push a frontal system
across the northern tier states. A shortwave dropping through the
Northeast Pacific should reach the Northwest around the middle of
next week, possibly supporting trough amplification over the West
and eventually a renewed southward push of the trailing part of
the northern tier front.

Synoptically, the latest guidance is still in reasonable agreement
through at least day 5. Some timing and detail differences remain
with the initial central to eastern U.S. trough, but by early
Tuesday, clustering is good for a compact coastal system to be
just off New England. Bigger questions arise after Tuesday on
timing and amplitude of the next upper shortwave pushing into the
Northwest. The GFS/GEFS continue to be weaker/faster while the
ECMWF/CMC (with support from their respective ensemble means) are
more amplified and as a result, slower. Given the typical low
predictability of features at the day 6-7 time frame, and somewhat
inconsistent run to run continuity in the guidance, prefer an
intermediate solution for the time being. Thus, a majority
deterministic model blend (ECMWF/GFS/CMC) for the first half of
the period transitions to more weighting towards the ensemble
means by the end. This also keeps good continuity with the
previous WPC forecast.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The Pacific Northwest into the Rockies will see the heaviest
precipitation during the period as a couple of fronts and
persistent onshore flow contribute to multiple episodes of coastal
rain and heavy mountain snow. Expect the highest totals to be over
favored terrain in the Olympics and Washington Cascades (some
liquid equivalent totals of 5" or greater possible for the
five-day period) with some significant totals reaching into parts
of western Oregon. The Plains into Great Lakes/New England low
pressure and associated fronts should produce some moderate wintry
precipitation on the northern side of the moisture shield, most
likely from the Midwest into the Northeast. Areas of light to
moderate rain are likely farther south. Some lake effect snow will
be possible in the chilly cyclonic flow behind this system.

The central to eastern states will continue to be below normal on
Sunday, but should finally get back to more normal mid-February
values by early next week and possibly even slightly above by the
end of the period. The West to northern tier should also trend
warmer early in the period, with parts of the northern Plains and
Southwest most likely to see daytime highs 10-20F above normal.
Late period troughing should bring a new push of colder air int
the Northwest and Rockies by next Wednesday-Thursday.

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will move eastward out of the southern Plains
today. Across the West Coast, an upper-level ridge will develop.
Surface conditions will remain rather cold with precipitation
occurring within the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. High
pressure will build into the Great Basin. Offshore winds in southern
California will be moderate in the typical wind-prone locations.
Humidity in some locations could approach 10-15% within some of the
valleys. With a majority of fuels generally unreceptive to fire
ignition and spread, fire weather concerns are not expected to be
more than locally elevated where fine fuels have been able to cure.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Upper-level flow will become less amplified as a flattened ridge
moves over the Plains ahead of the next trough along the West Coast.
The surface high in the southern Plains should shift east and
weaken. Enough mid-level flow across the Rockies will exist to
develop a lee trough in the High Plains. Dry and breezy conditions
are possible in eastern New Mexico and parts of West Texas. However,
recent cold temperatures and precipitation will drastically reduce
any potential fire weather concerns as fuels have become quite
unreceptive.

...Major winter storm to impact the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast
with heavy snow and significant ice accumulations today...

...Much below-average temperatures continue to linger over the
Central/Southern Plains into the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Southeast today, Pacific storm system to bring unsettled
weather to the Northwest and northern Rockies...

The headlining weather story today is a winter storm tracking
along the Southeast coast that produces heavy snow and significant
ice accumulations across the Mid-Atlantic. The swath of heaviest
snowfall is forecast to occur from the Appalachians of Virginia
and West Virginia to northern Maryland and southern Pennsylvania.
Snow totals of 6 to 8 inches are possible with localized totals up
to a foot in the Appalachians possible. Treacherous travel
conditions and delays are likely in these areas. A little farther
south, significant and disruptive ice accumulations are
anticipated in the Mid-Atlantic. Between a quarter to a half inch
of ice accumulation is expected from the northern North Carolina
Piedmont to southern Virginia. Some locations could receive a
dangerous half inch to three quarter of an inch in these
aforementioned areas. The result will be dangerous travel
conditions, numerous power outages, and extensive tree damage. The
footprint of a tenth to a quarter inch stretches as as north as
the I-95 corridor from the Washington D.C. to Philadelphia metro
areas. Snow eventually reaches the Northeast the second half of
the day and continues into Thursday night. Snow totals of 3 to 6
inches are possible from the Lower Hudson Valley to southern New
England. The worst of the snow and ice will be over in the
Mid-Atlantic but lingering areas of sleet and freezing rain could
prompt icy travel conditions into Friday morning.

The prolonged stretch of frigid temperatures courtesy of a strong
Arctic high pressure system continues to gradually loosen its icy
grip over the Heartland. That said, abnormally cold temperatures
will hang around through the end of the work-week. Record cold
daily maximum and minimum temperatures are likely to transpire in
the South Central U.S. through Saturday morning. The Plains and
Mississippi Valley can expect daily temperature anomalies ranging
between 20 and 30 degrees below normal. Thursday also looks to be
quite chilly in the Mid-Atlantic as the previously mentioned
winter storm unfolds across the region. After a very warm stretch
in recent days, Florida will enjoy one more day of summer-like
temperatures before a passing cold front ushers in the return of
below normal temperatures. The Sunshine State will witness highs
in the 80s throughout much of the state today, but generally sit
in the 60s on average for highs on Saturday.

Elsewhere precipitation-wise, the cold front sweeping through the
Southeast will trigger heavy showers and thunderstorms with some
storms potentially becoming severe. As a result, the Storm
Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for severe weather from
the Florida Panhandle and southern Georgia to far southern South
Carolina. There is also a Marginal Risk for excessive rainfall for
these same areas including eastern South Carolina and eastern
North Carolina. Showers and thunderstorms will linger along the
Southeast coast Friday morning as a cold front pushes west to
east. Florida will continue to experience scattered showers and
storms on Friday before drier conditions arrive Friday night as
high pressure builds in from the west. Meanwhile, a Pacific storm
system makes landfall in the Pacific Northwest this afternoon
delivering more coastal/valley rain and mountain snow to the
region. A steady onshore flow continues favors additional
upsloping winds along the Cascades while Pacific moisture advances
deeper into the Intermountain West. Through Friday night, 1 to 2
feet of snow is forecast to pile up along the Cascade Range with 6
to 12 inches of snow possible in the Sawtooth, Bitterroots, and
Teton mountain ranges. Those along the coastal range of northern
California and western Oregon/Washington may receive 1 to 2 inches
of rain through Friday night.

No changes. See previous discussion below.

..Bentley.. 09/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1254 AM CDT Wed Sep 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals a progressive shortwave
trough approaching the Pacific Northwest from the northeastern
Pacific. This feature will be responsible for augmenting
low/mid-level winds across parts of the West, which will likely
result in areas of fire weather concerns this afternoon. Outside of
a couple of regional concerns, recent rainfall and/or weak flow
regimes will limit the potential for robust wildfire threats.

...Northwest Nevada...
The upper-level trough axis is expected to propagate over the
northern Sierra late this afternoon and phase with peak daytime
heating. As a result, strengthening flow within a deep boundary
layer will support breezy conditions at the surface in the immediate
lee of the terrain. Downslope flow will help RH values fall into the
teens, and modestly receptive fuels (ERC values above the 75th
percentile) will support elevated fire weather conditions. Elevated
wind/RH combinations may evolve across southeast OR and northern NV,
but a combination of lower ERC values, potential for
rain/thunderstorms, and higher spread in model guidance yield lower
confidence in the fire weather threat for these locations.

...Northern Montana...
Strengthening zonal flow over the Canadian Rockies ahead of the
approaching trough will help deepen a lee surface low over the
Canadian Prairies. As a result, west to southwest winds will
increase to near 15 mph across much of northern MT. RH reductions
into the 15-25% range appear likely and will support elevated fire
weather conditions given above-seasonal ERC values for some
locations. Elevated conditions are possible outside of the
highlighted area, but lower probabilities for sustained 15+ mph
winds and a similar downward trend in deterministic wind speed yield
low confidence elsewhere.

...Southern Wyoming...
Elevated wind/RH combinations are probable across parts of southern
WY this afternoon as downslope winds increase to 15-20 mph with RH
values in the teens and low 20s. However, recent ERC analyses show
many locations are near or just below seasonal values, suggesting an
overall modest fire weather threat.

...Southern Plains...
Winds across the Southern Plains are forecast to be much weaker
today compared to yesterday; however, an unseasonably dry air mass
will remain in place with RH values in the 20-25% range expected
this afternoon. Light fire activity yesterday supports the idea of
receptive fuels, and occasional 15-20 mph wind gusts may support
localized fire weather concerns.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 22 2021

SYNOPSIS: A strong area of mid-level high pressure is forecast to become
centered over the east-central U.S. early in week-2. Increasing onshore flo=
w
is
expected to bring a wetter pattern to the Pacific Northwest next week and t=
his
may continue into the first week of October. Following anomalously cold
temperatures across Mainland Alaska during late September, a gradual
moderating
trend in temperatures is anticipated later in week-2. A tropical wave in th=
e
eastern Atlantic is likely to become a tropical cyclone and its future trac=
k
should be closely monitored.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of Mainland Alaska,
Thu-Fri, Sep 30-Oct 1.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 25 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 29:

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 30 - WEDNESDAY OCTOBER 06: Early in week-2, an
amplified
500-hPa trough continues to result in an increased risk of much below norma=
l
temperatures across Mainland Alaska. Due to its better skill recently, the
GEFS
reforecast was preferred in outlining the slight risk of much below normal
temperatures for parts of Mainland Alaska. The outlined area on Sep 30 and =
Oct
1 includes where the GEFS reforecast tool indicates that minimum temperatur=
es
have at least a 20 percent chance of falling into the lowest 15th percentil=
e
of
the climatological distribution and below 20 degrees F. The ECMWF reforecas=
t
tool remains the coldest model solution and shows a 20 to 40 percent chance=
 of
subzero lows across the North Slope of Alaska and also parts of eastern
Mainland Alaska into the beginning of October.



Ensemble means depict a high amplitude 500-hPa ridge axis located along or
east
of the Mississippi River later next week, which is likely to result in the
most
anomalous warmth shifting to the higher latitudes of the north-central CONU=
S.
The slight risk of much above normal temperatures, posted earlier this week=
,
is
discontinued as the preferred ECMWF reforecast tool depicts maximum
temperatures having  less than a 20 percent chance of exceeding the 85th
percentile by Sep 30. Although no temperature hazard is posted, above-norma=
l
temperatures and little to no rainfall is expected to favor additional drou=
ght
development or intensification across the central and southern Great Plains
heading into week-2.



Based on the latest GEFS tools, a brief period of heavy precipitation and h=
igh
winds may affect the coastal Pacific Northwest prior to week-2. The ECMWF
model
favors enhanced onshore flow most likely remaining at or north of 50N. The
week-2 GEFS (drier) and ECMWF (wetter) reforecast tools are in poor agreeme=
nt
for the Pacific Northwest. Therefore, no precipitation or wind hazards are
posted for the West Coast at this time.



A tropical wave currently located a few hundred miles southwest of the Cabo
Verde Islands is likely to become a tropical cyclone (TC) over the Main
Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic this week. The amplitude of a 500-=
hPa
trough near the East Coast will be a major factor on the eventual track nex=
t
week of this likely TC. The deterministic GFS models and many of its ensemb=
le
members favor the northward turn along 70W. However, the Canadian and ECMWF
models continue to depict a westward track which poses a risk to the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sep 30 and Oct 1. Please refer to the

...Heavy rainfall will slowly exit the Northeast/New England
Saturday...

...Overview...

Upper ridging near the Labrador Sea/Davis Strait and initially off
the West Coast into the Great Basin will favor troughing over the
Great Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low over the Southwest.
Troughing over the North Pacific this weekend will dive
southeastward early next week toward British Columbia and the
Pacific Northwest. This favors a mostly dry pattern for the middle
of the CONUS once as heights build and temperatures moderate. A
lead eastern system near New England will move into Atlantic
Canada as its upper level support wraps up through central Quebec.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models continued to struggle with the rather complex interaction
of several upper features over the Great Lakes/southern Canada
this weekend, resulting in poor run-to-run consistency for system
details for a day 3-4 lead time. Part of this is tied to the
movement, or lack thereof, of a Southwestern upper low that will
likely only slowly move eastward. Some GFS runs, including the 06Z
cycle, have pushed this farther east toward Texas by the weekend
which muddied the already uncertain trough forecast along and east
of 90W. 00Z GFS run aligned well with the other 00Z guidance
overall and used that as a base to start the forecast period. A
blended solution continued to act to minimize changes in the
guidance that have not been steady.

For the Northwest early to mid next week, considerable uncertainty
remains in how the upper pattern evolves as the energy moves
onshore toward the Intermountain West by the middle of next week.
The GFS Multi-day ensemble trend has been quicker, with the ECMWF
and Canadian ensembles a bit faster than the GEFS members. Despite
building ridging downstream, opted to rely more with the
larger/quicker consensus near the ECMWF ensemble mean by the end
of the period given the trend. This favored well with continuity
while adjusting toward the latest trends in the guidance.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow-moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Saturday. The second system in its wake will bring
additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the Great Lakes
region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a stationary/stalled
frontal boundary draped across central/south Florida will bring
daily chances of diurnally-driven thunderstorms. Much of the rest
of the Lower 48 will be relatively dry, though some isolated
showers and storms will be possible across portions of CA/NV/AZ
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week. Return flow moisture will bring increasing
chances of storms to Texas by the middle of next week, where some
models indicate some heavier amounts. Areas of the Pacific
Northwest may see periods of modest rain and some highest
elevation snow (once cooler temperatures push through) early next
week.

Cooler, but still near normal, temperatures will prevail across
the central/eastern U.S. this weekend in the wake of the cold
front passages. Meanwhile, as ridging aloft asserts itself across
the central U.S. and troughing develops on each coast, above
normal readings are likely across the central/northern Plains with
daily highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal Sunday into next week. A
front passing through the Northwest early next week will bring
below normal readings in its wake with highs 5 to locally 15
degrees below normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed September 22 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 28 - OCT 02, 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a deep trough
stretching from northern Alaska to the West Coast of the CONUS. Negative
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over most of Mainland Alaska, the Ala=
ska
Panhandle and parts of the northwestern CONUS, while positive 500-hPa heigh=
t
anomalies are favored over the western Aleutians. A broad ridge and associa=
ted
positive 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over much of the central an=
d
eastern CONUS.

Below normal temperatures are favored over the West Coast of the CONUS due =
to
a
forecast trough over the region. Near to above normal temperatures are like=
ly
for the remainder of the CONUS associated with persistent broad ridging and
above normal 500-hPa heights, and also consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool. Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated over mos=
t
of
Alaska underneath predicted troughing and below normal 500-hPa heights, whi=
le
near to above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over the wester=
n
Aleutians, under above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of =
the
western CONUS as well as parts of the Central and Southern Plains due to a
forecast trough along the West Coast and potential storm system development=
.
Near to below normal precipitation is likely for most of the eastern half o=
f
the CONUS and parts of the Northern Plains underneath forecast ridging and
above normal 500-hPa heights. Troughing and associated surface low pressure
over the Gulf of Alaska increases the odds of near to above normal
precipitation over the Panhandle due to increased southerly flow. Near to
below
normal precipitation probabilities are increased over Mainland Alaska and t=
he
Aleutians due to being farther displaced from the forecast surface low
pressure.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offse=
t
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 30 - OCT 06, 2021

Today's ensemble mean dynamical model forecasts are in good agreement on th=
e
predicted 500-hPa circulation pattern over North America for the week-2
period.
Anomalous ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over the
Aleutians, while a trough is predicted near the West Coast of the CONUS and
the
Alaska Panhandle. Predicted ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies a=
re
forecast over much of CONUS except for parts of the northwestern CONUS and =
the
Gulf Coast where weak negative height anomalies are indicated.

Below normal temperatures are favored over the West Coast of the CONUS due =
to
a
forecast trough near the region. Anomalous ridging with above normal 500-hP=
a
heights increases chances of near to above normal temperatures over the
remainder of the CONUS. Predicted troughing across Alaska and associated no=
rth
to northwesterly mid-level flow favor increased probabilities of below norm=
al
temperatures across Mainland Alaska and Alaska Panhandle, while near to abo=
ve
normal temperature probabilities are elevated over the western Aleutians,
under
above normal 500-hPa heights.

Near to above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over most of =
the
western CONUS due to a forecast trough near the West Coast, except for part=
s
of
the Northern High Plains where below normal precipitation is favored. Near =
to
below normal precipitation is favored across most of the eastern half of th=
e
CONUS, under the broad ridging and positive 500-hPa heights. Above normal
precipitation probabilities are increased over the Alaska Panhandle and par=
ts
of far western Mainland Alaska, while below normal precipitation is likely
over
southeastern Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation forecast to=
ol.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=

FORECASTER: Luke H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
October 21.

...Widespread heavy rain, localized severe weather to transpire
with areas of flooding likely from the Great Lakes to the northern
Mid-Atlantic this evening; Moderate Risks for Excessive Rainfall
are posted...

...Swath of heavy showers and thunderstorms reaches the Northeast
on Thursday; hazards such as flash flooding and severe weather are
possible...

...Autumn-like temperatures in the South and Northern Plains; the
West Coast gradually warms up the second half of the week...

All eyes are on a strengthening area of low pressure located in
the Ohio Valley this afternoon. This storm system is intensifying
thanks to a deepening upper level low tracking through the Lower
Great Lakes region. This wave of low pressure is responsible for
ongoing showers and thunderstorms up and down the East Coast and
as far west as the eastern Corn Belt. Thunderstorms will be severe
at times from the Ohio Valley on south into the Carolinas with
damaging wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes all possible. In
addition, a rich feed of tropical moisture accompanied within a
robust southerly wind field aloft supports Excessive Rainfall
rates within heavy showers and thunderstorms in advance of, and
along, an advancing cold front. This has led to the issuance of
two Moderate Risks for Excessive Rainfall; one in the central
Appalachians and one in portions of the Lower Great Lakes. Heavy
rainfall rates leading to areas of flash flooding is also a
concern in the northern Mid-Atlantic where soil moisture anomalies
remain overly saturated versus normal for parts of the region.
This has resulted in Flash Flood Watches being issued in these
aforementioned areas, including for some of the major markets of
the northern Mid-Atlantic. On the back side of the storm, periods
of moderate-to-heavy rainfall is likely to produce areas of flash
flooding in the lower Great Lakes this evening. Rapid runoff, fast
rising creeks and streams, and urbanized flash flooding are all
expected to occur where the most intense rainfall rates take shape.

As the low occludes over the Great Lakes tonight and into
Thursday, the cold front will gradually push east, shifting the
focus for heavier rainfall into the Northeast on Thursday. A
Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall remains in place from the
northern DelMarVa Peninsula and Delaware Valley on north into the
interior Northeast. The front's slow progression will keep rounds
of heavy showers and thunderstorms in the forecast across much of
New England on Friday, where a Marginal Risk for Excessive
Rainfall is in place. Farther south, the trailing end of the cold
front comes to a crawling speed over central Florida, leading to
daily rounds of strong thunderstorms capable of producing locally
heavy downpours over South Florida both Thursday and Friday.

Behind the front, high pressure and dry conditions look to stick
around throughout the Nation's Heartland Thursday and into Friday.
Farther west, a relatively dry cold front brings a reinforcing
shot of autumn-like temperatures to parts of the northern Rockies
on Thursday, then into the Northern Plains on Friday. Seasonally
cooler temperatures and more refreshing humidity levels engulf
much of the South, while the West Coast heats up as a ridge of
high pressure aloft builds in by Friday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0255 PM CDT Wed Sep 22 2021

Valid 231200Z - 241200Z

Added an elevated area for the southern Plains. More widespread
winds of 15 to 20 mph seem likely with relative humidity of 13 to 18
percent. In addition, recent fuel guidance shows ERC values locally
above the 90th percentile indicating pockets of critically dry fuels
are likely present.

..Bentley.. 09/22/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Wed Sep 22 2021/

...Synopsis...
Morning surface observations from the Canadian Prairies show weak
surface pressure falls already occurring as a lee low begins to
develop. This feature is expected to continue deepening today before
shifting eastward Thursday, funneling cold air into the northern and
central High Plains as a result. Breezy and dry conditions behind
this cold front may support a low-end fire weather concern.
Increasing southerly winds across the Southern Plains may likewise
support elevated conditions, but the probability of sustained 15+
mph winds appears too low for highlights at this time.

...Central High Plains...
Recent ensemble guidance shows reasonably high probabilities for
15-20 mph winds immediately behind the dry cold front as it shifts
southward along the High Plains. A combination of dry air advection
and a weak downslope component will likely result in widespread RH
reductions into the teens and low 20s. While elevated wind/RH
combinations appear likely, rainfall over the past 72 hours has
reduced fuel readiness for many locations. Dry conditions today may
help cure fine fuels to a degree, and highlights may be introduced
in subsequent outlooks if fuel conditions sufficiently deteriorate.

...Heavy rainfall will slowly exit the Northeast/New England
Saturday...

...Overview...

Upper ridging near the Labrador Sea/Davis Strait and initially off
the West Coast into the Great Basin will favor troughing over the
Great Lakes/Northeast and a small closed low over the Southwest.
Troughing over the North Pacific this weekend will dive
southeastward early next week toward British Columbia and the
Pacific Northwest. This favors a mostly dry pattern for the middle
of the CONUS once as heights build and temperatures moderate. A
lead eastern system near New England will move into Atlantic
Canada as its upper level support wraps up through central Quebec.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Models continued to struggle with the rather complex interaction
of several upper features over the Great Lakes/southern Canada
this weekend, resulting in poor run-to-run consistency for system
details for a day 3-4 lead time. Part of this is tied to the
movement, or lack thereof, of a Southwestern upper low that will
likely only slowly move eastward. Some GFS runs, including the 06Z
cycle, have pushed this farther east toward Texas by the weekend
which muddied the already uncertain trough forecast along and east
of 90W. 00Z GFS run aligned well with the other 00Z guidance
overall and used that as a base to start the forecast period. A
blended solution continued to act to minimize changes in the
guidance that have not been steady.

For the Northwest early to mid next week, considerable uncertainty
remains in how the upper pattern evolves as the energy moves
onshore toward the Intermountain West by the middle of next week.
The GFS Multi-day ensemble trend has been quicker, with the ECMWF
and Canadian ensembles a bit faster than the GEFS members. Despite
building ridging downstream, opted to rely more with the
larger/quicker consensus near the ECMWF ensemble mean by the end
of the period given the trend. This favored well with continuity
while adjusting toward the latest trends in the guidance.

...Weather and Potential Hazards...

Expect lingering rain, some of which could be locally heavy, along
and ahead of the slow-moving cold front across the Northeast and
New England on Saturday. The second system in its wake will bring
additional showers and possibly thunderstorms to the Great Lakes
region through the weekend. Meanwhile, a stationary/stalled
frontal boundary draped across central/south Florida will bring
daily chances of diurnally-driven thunderstorms. Much of the rest
of the Lower 48 will be relatively dry, though some isolated
showers and storms will be possible across portions of CA/NV/AZ
associated with the weak closed upper level low late this weekend
into early next week. Return flow moisture will bring increasing
chances of storms to Texas by the middle of next week, where some
models indicate some heavier amounts. Areas of the Pacific
Northwest may see periods of modest rain and some highest
elevation snow (once cooler temperatures push through) early next
week.

Cooler, but still near normal, temperatures will prevail across
the central/eastern U.S. this weekend in the wake of the cold
front passages. Meanwhile, as ridging aloft asserts itself across
the central U.S. and troughing develops on each coast, above
normal readings are likely across the central/northern Plains with
daily highs 10 to 15 degrees above normal Sunday into next week. A
front passing through the Northwest early next week will bring
below normal readings in its wake with highs 5 to locally 15
degrees below normal.

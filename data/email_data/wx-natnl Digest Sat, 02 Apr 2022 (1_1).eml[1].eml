Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1137 AM CDT Fri Apr 01 2022

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

Much of the previous forecast (see below) generally remains on
track. Mostly sunny skies are in place across eastern New Mexico
into western Texas, which is fostering boundary layer mixing.
Surface observations show RH already dropping to 20 percent in some
locales, and this trend is expected to continue across much of
western Texas. RH is expected to drop to 25 percent closer to
south-central Texas, where widespread 15-20 mph sustained southerly
surface winds will develop, warranting the southeastward expansion
of Elevated highlights when taking the very dry fuels into account.
Isolated dry thunderstorms are still expected with the onset of
convective initiation across far eastern New Mexico into the Texas
Panhandle, with only slight adjustments made to the Isolated Dry
Thunderstorm delineation to reflect the latest guidance consensus.

Elevated meteorological conditions may materialize across central
and eastern portions of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Georgia over the next few hours. Skies are sunny, with surface RH
already dropping below 30 percent in several spots, with guidance
consensus suggesting RH dropping by another 5 percent by afternoon
peak heating. While dry fuel beds should be present on a spotty
basis, several areas have also experienced appreciable rainfall
accumulations in the past 24 hours. As such, fire weather highlights
have been withheld for the East Coast. Nonetheless, localized
wildfire-spread concerns exist.

..Squitieri.. 04/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1239 AM CDT Fri Apr 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns are expected this afternoon across parts of
the southern High Plains, including the potential for isolated dry
thunderstorms. Early-morning water vapor imagery reveals a somewhat
diffuse upper-level disturbance over the central Rockies. This
feature is expected to shift to the east/southeast through the day
and slightly deepen amid modest mid-level cold advection associated
with an approaching cold front (noted in recent 700 mb analyses).
Very modest surface pressure falls are noted across east CO, but lee
cyclogenesis should become more pronounced through the day as the
upper wave ejects into the Plains.

...Southeast NM and southwest TX...
Both surface observations and 00Z soundings show a very dry air mass
in place across southwest TX/southeast NM this morning (dewpoint
values near the 10% percentile for early April). This air mass will
be reinforced by downslope warming/drying via increasing westerly
winds by early afternoon as a dryline tightens to the east across
west TX. Wind speeds between 15-20 mph will be common with frequent
gusts up to 25-30 mph possible. RH values are forecast to fall into
the low to mid teens, which should support widespread elevated to
locally critical fire weather conditions. Fuels across the region
remain receptive, denoted by fire activity in recent days, and will
support a widespread fire weather concern. Confidence in the
duration and coverage of this threat diminishes with northward
extent into east-central NM where increasing cloud cover, scattered
showers, and recent precipitation may limit the fire weather
potential (despite higher probability of sustained 20 mph winds).

...West-Central Texas into northwest OK and southwest KS...
Fire weather concerns are also possible to the east of the dryline
this afternoon, but may be more conditional on the quality of
moisture return through the day. Early morning surface obs show
dewpoints in the 50s already in place across south TX. However, the
00Z CRP sounding suggests this moisture resides in a rather shallow
boundary layer. As south to southeasterly winds increase through the
day this moisture will advect northwestward into west-central TX and
parts of western OK. Daytime mixing should mitigate the effects of
this moisture return to a degree, but confidence in exact RH
reductions is somewhat low. Nonetheless, increasing flow near 850 mb
ahead of the approaching wave/deepening trough will support
widespread sustained winds near 20 mph with gusts up to 30-35 mph
possible. Given the strong winds and receptive fuels, fire weather
concerns are expected despite more marginal RH reductions. The
duration of this threat may be limited for the eastern TX Panhandle,
western OK, and southwest KS due to developing showers/thunderstorms
in the mid to late afternoon hours.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
00Z soundings under the upper-level disturbance show cold
temperatures aloft and ample mid-level moisture. This thermodynamic
environment will advect to the east/southeast over the next 24
hours. The combination of cool, moist conditions atop a warm, dry
boundary layer will support sufficient instability for isolated to
scattered thunderstorms this afternoon from eastern NM into the TX
Panhandle. Although the dry sub-cloud layer may be somewhat shallow
(around 2 km deep), fast storm motions may limit rainfall amounts
for any one location and support an isolated dry thunderstorm
threat.

...Quieter weather pattern for most of the nation this weekend...

...Heavy rains and severe weather possible across central Florida
on Saturday...

...Lake effect snow showers diminish Friday night across northern
New England...

...Heavy precipitation to begin moving into the Pacific Northwest
late Sunday afternoon...

After several days of active weather from the Mississippi Valley
into the eastern U.S., more tranquil weather is on tap moving into
this weekend.  The surface frontal boundary that has been the
focus of this active weather will continue to push off the east
coast on Friday.  Lake effect snow showers in the wake of this
front will diminish Friday night across northern New England.
Temperatures will be below average this weekend from the Great
Lakes into the northeast, but not nearly as cold as the previous
cold air outbreak last weekend.

The southern portion of the front moving off the east coast will
become stationary across central Florida Friday afternoon,
remaining across this region through the weekend.  This front will
be the focus for potentially heavy rains and severe weather late
Saturday afternoon into Saturday night as an area of disturbed
weather is forecast to push off the eastern Gulf of Mexico and
ride from west to east along this frontal boundary.

A fast moving frontal system moving into the Plains Friday night
will move into the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley on Saturday
and east coast/northeast on Sunday.  The fast movement of this
system should keep any associated precipitation on the light side.
 Another fast moving system will emerge out of the Northern
Rockies on Saturday and move into the Northern Plains on Sunday.
Similar to the lead system, the expected quick movement should
limit precipitation potential across these areas.

The recent dry weather pattern across the Pacific Northwest to the
west of the Cascades will be coming to an end late this weekend as
precipiation begins to move back in associated with a cold front
moving off the northeast Pacific.  This will be the beginning of a
multi day precipitation event that will linger into the early part
of next week.  While he Pacific Northwest has seen below average
precipitation over the past few weeks, areas to the west of the
Cascades from western Washington State into northwest Oregon are
one of the few areas of the west not experiencing drought
conditions.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 01 2022

SYNOPSIS: Surface high pressure, with anomalously cold temperatures, is
forecast to become centered across the Southeast on April 9 and 10. A patte=
rn
change is likely at the outset of week-2 as mid-level low pressure develops
over the West. Periods of heavy snow are expected across the Cascades, Sier=
ra
Nevada and Klamath Mountains, and northern Rockies throughout week-2. To th=
e
east of this strengthening area of mid-level low pressure, surface low
development is likely across the central high Plains. Multiple weather
hazards,
including high winds, elevated wildfire danger, blowing dust, and
thunderstorms
with heavy rainfall, could affect parts of the southwestern and central U.S=
.
Surface high pressure is predicted to build across much of Mainland Alaska =
by
the middle of the period, increasing the potential for much below normal
temperatures across the southern half of the region.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Ohio
Valley, Lower Mississippi Valley, Tennessee Valley, Appalachians, Southeast=
,
and Mid-Atlantic, Sat, Apr 9.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the eastern CONU=
S,
Sat-Sun, Apr 9-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures expanding eastward across muc=
h
of
the western half of the CONUS, Sun-Fri, Apr 10-15.

Slight risk of periods of heavy snow for the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Klama=
th
Mountains, and northern Rockies, Sat-Fri, Apr 9-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the central U.S., Mon-Fri, =
Apr
11-15.

Moderate risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest, Central and Souther=
n
Rockies, and Central and Southern Great Plains, Sat-Mon, Apr 9-11.

Slight risk of high winds for parts of the Southwest, Central Great Basin,
Central and Southern Rockies, and Central and Southern Great Plains, Sat-Fr=
i,
Apr 9-15.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across the southern half of
Mainland Alaska, Mon-Fri, Apr 11-15.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY APRIL 04 - FRIDAY APRIL 08:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!of46ukJV7WY4INwMgHoVTHKX87gUtOFN4rklopwKdgQJBIpn0-pXzdFajI4I9=
AYyN_BPJBx7$

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 09 - FRIDAY APRIL 15: On April 9 and 10, an elevated ris=
k
of
a frost or freeze exists across the Tennessee Valley and southern Appalachi=
ans
where surface high pressure becomes centered. A moderate risk of much below
normal temperatures is posted for areas where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast
tools depict minimum temperatures having more than a 40 percent chance of a
frost or freeze and vegetation has emerged. Based on the surface pattern an=
d
temperature tools, frost may extend as far south as the Coastal Plain of th=
e
Southeast with a freeze across the southern Appalachians.



The GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means are in excellent agreement
indicating a high amplitude 500-hPa trough developing over the West early i=
n
week-2. A major temperature change is forecast across the West during early=
 to
mid-April associated with this pattern transition to troughing by the start=
 of
the period. Model guidance initiates this trough formation slightly earlier=
 in
the period compared to yesterday's guidance, resulting in an adjustment in =
the
start time for the much below normal hazard posted across the West compared=
 to
yesterday. A broad area is highlighted across the West with a slight risk o=
f
much below normal temperatures, Apr 10 to 15. This risk is initially expect=
ed
across the northwestern CONUS, expanding eastward throughout the period as =
the
mid-level trough progresses eastward. There is good agreement between the G=
EFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting minimum temperatures having at least a=
 20
percent chance of falling below the 15th percentile and at or below freezin=
g.
Given the anticipation of troughing quickly amplifying at the beginning of
week-2 across the West, the much above normal temperature hazard across the
southwestern CONUS is not included in today's outlook.



The trough across the West is anticipated to amplify until the middle of th=
e
period, gradually weakening thereafter. A slight risk of periods of heavy s=
now
is designated for the Cascades, Sierra Nevada, Klamath Mountains, and north=
ern
Rockies throughout the entirety of week-2 given the enhanced moist flow
associated with the persistent mid-level troughing. There is good multi-mod=
el
support among uncalibrated and deterministic guidance as well as in the
experimental GEFS reforecast tool, which indicates at least a 20% chance of
highlighted heavy snow risk areas receiving 3-day liquid equivalent totals
exceeding the 85th percentile and 0.5 inches (1 inch locally).



Downstream of this 500-hPa trough, a couple of low pressure systems are
forecast to track from the central Great Plains to the Great Lakes during
week-2. Based on the longwave pattern, ensemble mean solutions, and the
uncalibrated ECMWF model guidance, a slight risk of heavy precipitation (mo=
re
than 1 inch per 24 hours) is posted from the eastern Great Plains to the Oh=
io
Valley, beginning on April 11 until the end of week-2. This heavy rainfall
could eventually renew flooding across the Ohio River Valley during mid-Apr=
il.



Based on excellent model agreement and continuity with an amplified trough
over
the West and leeside surface cyclogenesis across the central high Plains, a
moderate risk of high winds is posted for the Southwest and central to
southern
Great Plains from Apr 9 to 11. Wind gusts are expected to exceed 40mph in t=
he
moderate risk area. Along with gusty winds, blowing dust and elevated wildf=
ire
danger are also likely. A slight risk of high winds continues through the e=
nd
of week-2 as this favorable longwave pattern is forecast to persist. The
reforecast tools are in good agreement indicating at least a 20% chance of
wind
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph, locally. Probabilities in =
the
reforecast tools are greater compared to yesterday, with the ECMWF indicati=
ng
the greatest probabilities (>30%) of wind speeds reaching these thresholds
across the Central and Southern Plains.



There is good multi-model depiction from ensemble means indicating troughin=
g
across the West supporting surface low formation over the Great Plains
accompanied by a front ahead of it over the Mississippi Valley by Apr 11. E=
ven
though guidance does not support rainfall totals reaching hazardous criteri=
a,
there could be locally heavy rainfall with any thunderstorms across the
eastern
Plains and Mississippi Valley. Also, soils are saturated for the middle
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys which would be prone to flooding with any heav=
y
rainfall.



Following recent runoff from snowmelt, spring flooding began along the Red
River of the North during late March. The flooding possible hazards is post=
ed
for areas north of Grand Forks, North Dakota based on forecasts from the
Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service and anticipated rainfall during week=
-2.



Surface high pressure is anticipated to build across much of Mainland Alask=
a
by
the middle of the period, supporting cold arctic air extending into the
region.
A slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for the southern
half
of Mainland Alaska, Apr 11 to 15, where uncalibrated GEFS and ECMWF ensembl=
es
indicate at least -10 Deg F departures from normal (GEFS has a greater expa=
nse
reaching this threshold), and where reforecast tools show at least a 20%
chance
of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile. The amplifie=
d
ridging over the Aleutians and Bering Sea favors a continuation of below-
normal
temperatures into the second week of April. This relatively cool start to t=
he
month may help to slow river ice breakup.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...

19Z Update: The 12Z guidance suite has a very good overall
depiction of the amplifying pattern as the deep upper trough
builds over the north-central U.S. next week.  Although still
slightly progressive, the 12Z run of the GFS has trended closer to
the non-NCEP model consensus, and therefore a deterministic model
blend sufficed as a good starting point in the forecast process.
However, differences are more apparent for the northwestern U.S.
as the next system approaches, with the GFS well ahead of the
model consensus by Friday, and a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS blend approach
works well for the West Coast region.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall threat across the Deep South and Gulf Coast region, the
corridor of heaviest rainfall is favored from the Red River Valley
of TX/OK eastward to central AL and the southern Appalachians,
with some scattered 3+ inch totals within the realm of
possibility.  Multiple rounds of strong to severe storms and
likely a squall line are also expected across many of these same
areas.  The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick
--------------------

...Overview...

The large scale pattern will undergo a dramatic change over the
course of the period, as fairly low-amplitude progressive flow
leading into the start of the period early Monday transitions to a
western ridge/east-central U.S. upper trough with a closed low
currently expected to track from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes by around Wednesday-Friday.  A strong jet arriving
into the Northwest early in the week will initially focus heavy
precipitation over that part of the country and then the
developing upper trough/associated surface evolution will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern half of the lower 48 with
heaviest totals forecast to be across the South.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another episode of unseasonably
warm temperatures to that part of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and means offer good agreement with the overall
pattern evolution while exhibiting some typical detail differences
that have medium to low predictability.  Of particular note,
latest GFS runs have been on the southern side of the spread for
the upper low that tracks over the Plains and Midwest late Tuesday
through Wednesday and GFS runs have tended to be more eager to
bring Pacific shortwave energy into the northern part of the
western ridge late in the period (which the new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted toward).  As the main system of interest reaches the East
late in the week, differences are fairly modest for a days 6-7
forecast with the GFS/GEFS slightly northeast of the ECMWF/CMC and
their means.  A starting point consisting of a 12Z/18Z model blend
early and then a model/ensemble mean blend later on provided a
good intermediate solution with only modest refinements to
continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong upper jet pushing into the Northwest early next week will
bring an episode of enhanced coastal/terrain rain and mountain
snow to the Pacific Northwest with significant totals extending
into the northern Rockies.  After this moisture departs, the upper
ridge building into the West will bring dry weather to much of the
region Wednesday-Friday.  Downstream upper trough amplification
and surface low/front evolution will promote active weather over
the central/eastern U.S.  With typical run-to-run refinements and
some spread in the details, there is a persistent signal for heavy
rainfall potential from near the southeastern Plains into the
Southeast during the first half of the week.  This region has the
best overlap of moist Gulf inflow and instability, along with
focus from a couple surface fronts.  The Storm Prediction Center
is also monitoring this system for strong to severe convection,
with more details forthcoming as predictability improves over
future guidance runs.  Other parts of the central/eastern U.S.
could see pockets of locally moderate to heavy rain as well.
Meanwhile some snow could be possible along the northern tier, on
the cold side of the upper low track, as well as into parts of New
England.

The upper ridge building into the West will support another period
of well above normal temperatures across the region by
Wednesday-Friday.  The greatest anomalies for daytime highs should
be from California and southern Oregon into the Great Basin, with
highs 10-20F above normal and some locations reaching 20-25F above
normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible
late in the week.  Ahead of the ridge, cool air under the
amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to 5-15F below
normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday and progressing into
the east-central U.S. by Friday.  Leading warm/moist flow ahead of
the upper trough/surface system will bring a couple days of above
normal readings (especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

England.

The upper ridge building into the West will support another period
of well above normal temperatures across the region by
Wednesday-Friday.  The greatest anomalies for daytime highs should
be from California and southern Oregon into the Great Basin, with
highs 10-20F above normal and some locations reaching 20-25F above
normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible
late in the week.  Ahead of the ridge, cool air under the
amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to 5-15F below
normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday and progressing into
the east-central U.S. by Friday.  Leading warm/moist flow ahead of
the upper trough/surface system will bring a couple days of above
normal readings (especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to focus across the
South next week...
...Pacific Northwest heavy rain and terrain/mountain heavy snow
threat inland to the northern Rockies...

19Z Update: The 12Z guidance suite has a very good overall
depiction of the amplifying pattern as the deep upper trough
builds over the north-central U.S. next week.  Although still
slightly progressive, the 12Z run of the GFS has trended closer to
the non-NCEP model consensus, and therefore a deterministic model
blend sufficed as a good starting point in the forecast process.
However, differences are more apparent for the northwestern U.S.
as the next system approaches, with the GFS well ahead of the
model consensus by Friday, and a CMC/ECMWF/ECENS blend approach
works well for the West Coast region.  In terms of the heavy
rainfall threat across the Deep South and Gulf Coast region, the
corridor of heaviest rainfall is favored from the Red River Valley
of TX/OK eastward to central AL and the southern Appalachians,
with some scattered 3+ inch totals within the realm of
possibility.  Multiple rounds of strong to severe storms and
likely a squall line are also expected across many of these same
areas.  The previous discussion follows below. /Hamrick
--------------------

...Overview...

The large scale pattern will undergo a dramatic change over the
course of the period, as fairly low-amplitude progressive flow
leading into the start of the period early Monday transitions to a
western ridge/east-central U.S. upper trough with a closed low
currently expected to track from the northern Plains into the
Great Lakes by around Wednesday-Friday.  A strong jet arriving
into the Northwest early in the week will initially focus heavy
precipitation over that part of the country and then the
developing upper trough/associated surface evolution will spread
precipitation across much of the eastern half of the lower 48 with
heaviest totals forecast to be across the South.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another episode of unseasonably
warm temperatures to that part of the country.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Latest models and means offer good agreement with the overall
pattern evolution while exhibiting some typical detail differences
that have medium to low predictability.  Of particular note,
latest GFS runs have been on the southern side of the spread for
the upper low that tracks over the Plains and Midwest late Tuesday
through Wednesday and GFS runs have tended to be more eager to
bring Pacific shortwave energy into the northern part of the
western ridge late in the period (which the new 00Z ECMWF has
adjusted toward).  As the main system of interest reaches the East
late in the week, differences are fairly modest for a days 6-7
forecast with the GFS/GEFS slightly northeast of the ECMWF/CMC and
their means.  A starting point consisting of a 12Z/18Z model blend
early and then a model/ensemble mean blend later on provided a
good intermediate solution with only modest refinements to
continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A strong upper jet pushing into the Northwest early next week will
bring an episode of enhanced coastal/terrain rain and mountain
snow to the Pacific Northwest with significant totals extending
into the northern Rockies.  After this moisture departs, the upper
ridge building into the West will bring dry weather to much of the
region Wednesday-Friday.  Downstream upper trough amplification
and surface low/front evolution will promote active weather over
the central/eastern U.S.  With typical run-to-run refinements and
some spread in the details, there is a persistent signal for heavy
rainfall potential from near the southeastern Plains into the
Southeast during the first half of the week.  This region has the
best overlap of moist Gulf inflow and instability, along with
focus from a couple surface fronts.  The Storm Prediction Center
is also monitoring this system for strong to severe convection,
with more details forthcoming as predictability improves over
future guidance runs.  Other parts of the central/eastern U.S.
could see pockets of locally moderate to heavy rain as well.
Meanwhile some snow could be possible along the northern tier, on
the cold side of the upper low track, as well as into parts of New
England.

The upper ridge building into the West will support another period
of well above normal temperatures across the region by
Wednesday-Friday.  The greatest anomalies for daytime highs should
be from California and southern Oregon into the Great Basin, with
highs 10-20F above normal and some locations reaching 20-25F above
normal.  Some daily records for highs/warm lows will be possible
late in the week.  Ahead of the ridge, cool air under the
amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to 5-15F below
normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday and progressing into
the east-central U.S. by Friday.  Leading warm/moist flow ahead of
the upper trough/surface system will bring a couple days of above
normal readings (especially for morning lows) to the East around
Wednesday-Thursday.

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

Elevated highlights have been added across portions of eastern New
Mexico into western Texas for tomorrow/Saturday. By afternoon, dry
southerly flow will develop, with 15+ mph sustained winds
overlapping with 15-20 percent RH. Elevated highlights have been
introduced where fuels are at least modestly receptive to wildfire
spread, and where guidance shows Day 1 thunderstorms to remain more
isolated (i.e. a lack of appreciable rainfall accumulations).
Elevated conditions may span farther northeast to the Oklahoma
Panhandle/Kansas/Colorado border area, but potential accumulating
rainfall from Day 1 in this area precludes highlights at this time.

..Squitieri.. 04/01/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Fri Apr 01 2022/

...Synopsis...
Widespread fire weather potential will generally be limited for
Saturday, though a few localized concerns may materialize across the
southern and central High Plains. The upper-level low currently over
the central Rockies is forecast to quickly shift into the
southeastern CONUS by Saturday. In its wake, weaker zonal flow over
the southern U.S. is expected with surface high pressure across the
Plains. This synoptic pattern will generally favor quiescent
conditions for regions with the driest fuels. Across the northern
Rockies, a progressive shortwave trough will aid in deepening a lee
trough along the northern to central High Plains. Downslope west to
southwesterly winds off the higher terrain will likely yield areas
of elevated wind/RH conditions across parts of eastern WY and
eastern NM. Given weak to modest upper-level support and a stagnant
surface pattern, such conditions will likely be confined to close
proximity of terrain features in areas with marginally receptive
fuels and/or recent precipitation.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 01 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 07 - 11 2022

The ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian models are in less agreement today about the
overall 500-hPa height pattern for the 6-10 day period than yesterday. The
European and Canadian models both have a broad ridge over the Bering Sea an=
d
adjacent North Pacific, while the GEFS has a ridge mostly over the Bering S=
ea,
and a small trough just offshore from British Columbia and the Pacific
Northwest. All three models have a trough situated over the southwestern US=
,
but they disagree on the strength of the anomaly. Similarly, all models hav=
e a
trough over the North Atlantic and northern Europe, but once again there is
disagreement about the strength of the trough. Since there is no clear outl=
ier
among the models, they are given equal weighting in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day 500-hPa
manual blend even though there is not very good agreement among model
solutions.

The 6-10 day temperature forecast features continued above-average
temperatures
for the western CONUS, along with a small area of below average temperature=
s
for the Pacific Northwest as a trough begins to move in from the North
Pacific.
Also of note is a broad area of below-average temperatures for the
southeastern
US as a trough continues to dominate the region. Onshore flow at the northe=
rn
extent of the trough will bring a slight chance for above average temperatu=
res
to New England. Alaska is predicted to have below average temperatures,
especially southwestern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.

The precipitation forecast for the 6-10 day period calls for below average
precipitation for much of the CONUS including much of California, Nevada, t=
he
Four Corners region, the southern and central Great Plains, the Great Lakes=
,
the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, and the Mid-Atlantic and southweste=
rn
US, with highest probabilities of below-normal precipitation covering the
lower
Mississippi and Ohio River valleys, Oklahoma and Texas, portions of the Dee=
p
South and the southern Appalachian Mountains. Much of Alaska is favored for
above-average precipitation, with near-normal conditions for parts of the
northern coast, southwestern Alaska, and the Aleutian Islands.



The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 33% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast Confidence: moderate,=
 3
out of 5 due to some disagreement between models.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 09 - 15 2022

Similar to the 6-10 day period, the dynamical models during the 8-14 day
period
have similar 500-hPa height patterns overall, but there is disagreement on
many
details. The models all favor ridging over the Bering Sea, with some variat=
ion
in the strength. The ECMWF and Canadian both extend this ridge southward in=
to
the adjacent North Pacific, while the GEFS confines the ridge mostly to the
Bering Sea. All the models have a trough over the Pacific Northwest, with s=
ome
variation on the strength and location of this feature. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs manual blend
of
the 8-14 day 500-hPa height forecast depicts a more amplified pattern than
yesterday, with a broad ridge over the Bering Sea and adjacent North Pacifi=
c,
and a strengthening trough located over the Pacific Northwest.

Reflecting the growing trough over the Pacific Northwest, the 8-14 day
temperature forecast features a broad area of below-average temperatures fo=
r
the Rocky Mountains and west to the Pacific Ocean, with the highest
probabilities over the Pacific Northwest. There is also an area of slight
chance for above average temperatures that extends from central Texas throu=
gh
the central Great Plains, across the Great Lakes region and into the
Mid-Atlantic and New England. Alaska is forecast to continue with below-
average
temperatures, with the highest probabilities shifting eastward into southea=
st
Alaska and the panhandle.

The 8-14 day precipitation forecast has above average precipitation for the
northern states west of the Great Lakes, the northern Great Basin and the
upper
and central Mississippi River Valley. Below-average precipitation is favore=
d
for eastern New Mexico, western and southern Texas, and the East Coast from
Florida up into southern New England, with the highest probabilities for th=
e
Mid-Atlantic region. Alaska is generally favored to have above-normal
precipitation, except for southwestern Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, whi=
ch
are forecast to be near normal.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 33% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 34% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 33% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence: Moderate,=
 3
out of 5, with good agreement between models, offset by a changing large-sc=
ale
pattern.

FORECASTER: Daniel Barandiaran

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 21.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1253 AM CDT Sat Apr 02 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will remain limited to the southern High
Plains today. A progressive upper-level disturbance over the
Southern Plains in early-morning water vapor imagery continues to
move to the east/southeast, leaving clearing skies and surface high
pressure in its wake over the southern High Plains. This surface
high will gradually shift east by mid afternoon, and modest surface
pressure falls are expected along the lee of the Rockies under a
weak zonal flow regime aloft. This will support a gradual increase
in south/southwesterly pressure-gradient winds across eastern
NM/west TX. Sustained winds between 15-20 mph appear likely and may
gust up to 20-30 mph at times. Poor moisture recovery into the
region will maintain depressed dewpoints and afternoon RH reductions
into the 15-20% range. While parts of far eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle received wetting rainfall over the past 24 hours, most
locations south of I-40 remain dry and have receptive fuels that
should support a fire weather concern.

Localized elevated conditions may develop in the lee of the central
Rockies across WY and southern MT as downslope winds increase to
15-20 mph late in the afternoon. These conditions are expected to be
relatively brief and will occur over areas with only marginally dry
fuels.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to extend into the
Southeast next Tuesday...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to agree upon the transition of the upper level
pattern to an amplified and slowly evolving regime consisting of a
trough drifting over the central-eastern U.S. (containing a
northern Plains into Great Lakes low) and ridge building over the
West.  An upstream Pacific trough should reach the West Coast by
around next Saturday, pushing the ridge axis into the northern
Plains through southern Rockies.  Ahead of the amplifying upper
trough, southern tier convection producing some heavy rainfall
expected to be already in progress at the start of the period
early Tuesday should extend through the Southeast and vicinity
Tuesday-Tuesday night, helped along by a Lower Mississippi Valley
through Mid-Atlantic surface wave.  The system more directly
associated with the upper trough will also produce precipitation
across the eastern half of the country mid-late week with
potential for some areas of enhanced totals.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another period of unseasonably
warm temperatures that should peak around Thursday-Friday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part the models and ensembles remain in good
agreement for the overall evolution of the amplified
central-eastern U.S. upper trough and associated surface
evolution, with fairly typical scattering of individual solutions.
 Reviewing runs through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/GEFS continued
their recent tendency to be a little on the southern/southeastern
side of the full spread for the portion of the upper low track
over the northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley and then a bit
faster with northeastward progression of the surface reflection
over the East.  Preference remained with an intermediate approach
fairly close to continuity.  The new 00Z GFS offers favorable
trends in both regards.  By days 6-7 Friday-Saturday, the details
within the core of the upper trough become more ambiguous as
solutions vary with where the initial upper low may track and
whether separate energy could yield another low center.  Meanwhile
the Tuesday-Wednesday wave tracking from the Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic displays typical scatter but good
continuity for the overall consensus.

Guidance has been showing some difficulty in resolving the details
of Pacific flow pushing into the western ridge late in the period,
as demonstrated by a widening ensemble spread over the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. by Friday-Saturday.  Through the 12Z/18Z
cycles, the ensemble means and 12Z ECMWF represented the majority
scenario of keeping the western ridge fairly strong into Friday
while a Pacific trough reaches near the West Coast around early
Saturday.  The 18Z GFS was somewhat slower while the past couple
CMC runs have been somewhat fast/amplified with the trough.  The
new 00Z GFS has adjusted closer to the means/12Z ECMWF.

Model/ensemble comparisons and continuity led to favoring an
operational model blend during the first half of the period and
then a transition to a model/mean mix with the increase of detail
uncertainty.  This yielded a 60-70 percent tilt toward the ECMWF
cluster where differences existed and the new 00Z GFS adds support
for leaning away from some specifics of earlier GFS cycles.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A leading central-eastern U.S. shortwave and Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic surface low will help to focus areas
of heavy rainfall over the Southeast and vicinity Tuesday into
Tuesday night, extending an event that should initiate farther
westward in the short-range time frame.  The deep upper low
tracking over the northern Plains and Great Lakes will support a
corresponding surface low while leading height falls will bring a
front to the East Coast, with a triple point wave possibly
becoming the dominant surface feature by the end of the week.
Over the course of the period these features may produce some
areas of heavy precipitation over the northern and eastern U.S.
but with uncertainty over specifics at this time.  Regions of
potential interest include parts of the Midwest to Lake Superior
with the parent system, portions of the Northeast where a coastal
wave could focus moisture, and locations farther south along the
trailing cold front.  Check the Storm Prediction Center's latest
outlooks for more information regarding severe threats across the
southern tier.  Extreme northern areas from the Upper Midwest into
interior New England may see some precipitation fall in the form
of snow.  Over the West, the strong jet initially crossing the
region should produce some light to moderate rain/high elevation
snow during Tuesday.  Then expect most of the region to be dry
until late in the week when light precipitation may reach the
Northwest ahead of an approaching upper trough.

Expect the Southwest to see highs up to 10-15F above normal
through the period.  The upper ridge building into the West will
expand coverage of above normal temperatures mid-late week,
followed by some moderation on Saturday as the Pacific trough
arrives.  Much of California should see highs at least 10F above
normal Wednesday and greatest anomalies (plus 10-20F and locally
higher) will likely extend from California and southern Oregon
into the Great Basin Thursday-Friday.  Some daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible late in the week.  Meanwhile cool
air under the amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to
5-15F below normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday, the
central U.S. Wednesday-Thursday, and eastern states by
Friday-Saturday. Flow ahead of the upper trough/surface system
will bring a couple days of above normal readings (especially for
morning lows) to the East around Wednesday-Thursday.

...Heavy rainfall/convection and runoff threat to extend into the
Southeast next Tuesday...

...Overview...

Guidance continues to agree upon the transition of the upper level
pattern to an amplified and slowly evolving regime consisting of a
trough drifting over the central-eastern U.S. (containing a
northern Plains into Great Lakes low) and ridge building over the
West.  An upstream Pacific trough should reach the West Coast by
around next Saturday, pushing the ridge axis into the northern
Plains through southern Rockies.  Ahead of the amplifying upper
trough, southern tier convection producing some heavy rainfall
expected to be already in progress at the start of the period
early Tuesday should extend through the Southeast and vicinity
Tuesday-Tuesday night, helped along by a Lower Mississippi Valley
through Mid-Atlantic surface wave.  The system more directly
associated with the upper trough will also produce precipitation
across the eastern half of the country mid-late week with
potential for some areas of enhanced totals.  The upper ridge
building into the West will bring another period of unseasonably
warm temperatures that should peak around Thursday-Friday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part the models and ensembles remain in good
agreement for the overall evolution of the amplified
central-eastern U.S. upper trough and associated surface
evolution, with fairly typical scattering of individual solutions.
 Reviewing runs through the 12Z/18Z cycles, the GFS/GEFS continued
their recent tendency to be a little on the southern/southeastern
side of the full spread for the portion of the upper low track
over the northern Plains/Upper Mississippi Valley and then a bit
faster with northeastward progression of the surface reflection
over the East.  Preference remained with an intermediate approach
fairly close to continuity.  The new 00Z GFS offers favorable
trends in both regards.  By days 6-7 Friday-Saturday, the details
within the core of the upper trough become more ambiguous as
solutions vary with where the initial upper low may track and
whether separate energy could yield another low center.  Meanwhile
the Tuesday-Wednesday wave tracking from the Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic displays typical scatter but good
continuity for the overall consensus.

Guidance has been showing some difficulty in resolving the details
of Pacific flow pushing into the western ridge late in the period,
as demonstrated by a widening ensemble spread over the eastern
Pacific/western U.S. by Friday-Saturday.  Through the 12Z/18Z
cycles, the ensemble means and 12Z ECMWF represented the majority
scenario of keeping the western ridge fairly strong into Friday
while a Pacific trough reaches near the West Coast around early
Saturday.  The 18Z GFS was somewhat slower while the past couple
CMC runs have been somewhat fast/amplified with the trough.  The
new 00Z GFS has adjusted closer to the means/12Z ECMWF.

Model/ensemble comparisons and continuity led to favoring an
operational model blend during the first half of the period and
then a transition to a model/mean mix with the increase of detail
uncertainty.  This yielded a 60-70 percent tilt toward the ECMWF
cluster where differences existed and the new 00Z GFS adds support
for leaning away from some specifics of earlier GFS cycles.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

A leading central-eastern U.S. shortwave and Lower Mississippi
Valley through Mid-Atlantic surface low will help to focus areas
of heavy rainfall over the Southeast and vicinity Tuesday into
Tuesday night, extending an event that should initiate farther
westward in the short-range time frame.  The deep upper low
tracking over the northern Plains and Great Lakes will support a
corresponding surface low while leading height falls will bring a
front to the East Coast, with a triple point wave possibly
becoming the dominant surface feature by the end of the week.
Over the course of the period these features may produce some
areas of heavy precipitation over the northern and eastern U.S.
but with uncertainty over specifics at this time.  Regions of
potential interest include parts of the Midwest to Lake Superior
with the parent system, portions of the Northeast where a coastal
wave could focus moisture, and locations farther south along the
trailing cold front.  Check the Storm Prediction Center's latest
outlooks for more information regarding severe threats across the
southern tier.  Extreme northern areas from the Upper Midwest into
interior New England may see some precipitation fall in the form
of snow.  Over the West, the strong jet initially crossing the
region should produce some light to moderate rain/high elevation
snow during Tuesday.  Then expect most of the region to be dry
until late in the week when light precipitation may reach the
Northwest ahead of an approaching upper trough.

Expect the Southwest to see highs up to 10-15F above normal
through the period.  The upper ridge building into the West will
expand coverage of above normal temperatures mid-late week,
followed by some moderation on Saturday as the Pacific trough
arrives.  Much of California should see highs at least 10F above
normal Wednesday and greatest anomalies (plus 10-20F and locally
higher) will likely extend from California and southern Oregon
into the Great Basin Thursday-Friday.  Some daily records for
highs/warm lows will be possible late in the week.  Meanwhile cool
air under the amplifying upper trough will bring highs down to
5-15F below normal over the northern Rockies on Tuesday, the
central U.S. Wednesday-Thursday, and eastern states by
Friday-Saturday. Flow ahead of the upper trough/surface system
will bring a couple days of above normal readings (especially for
morning lows) to the East around Wednesday-Thursday.

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WESTERN TO CENTRAL NEBRASKA...

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will increase across parts of the Great Plains
and southern High Plains Sunday afternoon as a surface low and
attendant lee trough migrate across the northern MO River Valley.
Localized fire concerns are possible across parts of the
Mid-Atlantic where dry conditions are likely within an offshore flow
regime.

...Nebraska...
A compact upper-level trough, noted in early-morning water vapor
imagery moving onto the Pacific Northwest coast, is forecast to
quickly propagate eastward into the northern Plains through the day.
An attendant surface low will likely migrate from the lee of the
northern Rockies into the upper MO River Valley by Sunday evening
with a trailing surface trough to the south/southwest. The
northwesterly flow regime behind the trough will spread a
continental air mass over the Plains. While there is some spread in
ensemble guidance regarding afternoon highs and associated RH
reductions, these flow regimes tend to verify on the warmer side of
ensemble temperature distributions due to downslope warming/drying.
As such, drier solutions that depict widespread RH reductions into
the 15-25% range appear more probable. Such low RH, combined with
sustained winds near 20 mph and unseasonably high ERC values, will
support critical fire weather conditions across western to central
NE. Elevated conditions appear likely in adjacent Plains states, and
may extend well into western KS (though confidence in this potential
is somewhat low).

...Southern High Plains...
While a more robust surface low is expected to the north across the
Plains, a weaker lee cyclone will likely begin to deepen across
eastern NM/west TX by the late afternoon hours. Ensemble guidance
shows reasonably high probability for 15-20 mph southwesterly winds
across southern/southeast NM in response to the deepening low. Dry
trajectories from northern Mexico, combined with downslope
warming/drying, should support areas of elevated fire weather
conditions in the lee of terrain features. Elevated conditions may
be more widespread and extend into western TX, but this will be
conditional on the placement and strength of the surface low.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry conditions with northwesterly offshore flow are expected along
the East Coast in the wake of a cold frontal passage Sunday
afternoon. Although winds will generally be weak (5-10 mph with
localized gusts to 15 mph), RH values will likely fall below 25%,
especially in the lee of the Blue Ridge mountains. 10-hour fuels
across NC and VA remain dry and ERC estimates are well above the
90th percentile, which may support at least a localized fire weather
concern.

...No major weather systems expected to impact the nation this
weekend although some heavy rains/severe weather possible today
across central Florida...

...Unsettled weather begins moving into the Pacific Northwest
later on Sunday followed by heavy precipitation and windy
conditions on Monday...

With the departure of a deep low pressure system into eastern
Canada, more tranquil weather is on tap for most of the nation
this weekend.  The remaining snow showers in the wake of this
system across New England is expected to taper off this morning.
Temperatures will be below average this weekend from the Great
Lakes into the northeast, but not nearly as cold as the previous
cold air outbreak last weekend.

Meanwhile, the southern edge of the cold air mass will become
nearly stationary across central Florida through the weekend.
This frontal boundary will become the focus for potentially heavy
rains and severe weather later this afternoon into tonight as a
subtle disturbance aloft is forecast to push off the eastern Gulf
of Mexico and ride from west to east along this frontal boundary.

Over the Great Plains, a fast-moving frontal wave is forecast to
reach the lower Great Lakes by tonight and begins to deepen as it
moves across the northeastern U.S. on Sunday.  The fast movement
of this system should keep any associated precipitation on the
light side.  A swath of rain/snow mix is forecast to move through
the upper Midwest/Great Lakes this weekend and then New England
Sunday night/early Monday.  Another fast moving system will emerge
out of the Northern Rockies on Saturday, through the northern
Plains on Sunday before reaching the upper Midwest early on
Monday.  Similar to the lead system, the expected quick movement
should limit precipitation potential across these areas but a
swath of rain/snow mix is also expected north of the system
center.  Thunderstorms could expected farther south over the
southern Plains with increasing Gulf moisture.

The recent dry weather pattern across the Pacific Northwest to the
west of the Cascades will be coming to an end late this weekend as
precipiation begins to move back in ahead of the next cold front
from the northeastern Pacific.  This will be the beginning of a
multi day precipitation event that will linger into the early part
of next week.  While the Pacific Northwest has seen below average
precipitation over the past few weeks, areas to the west of the
Cascades from western Washington State into northwest Oregon are
one of the few areas of the West not experiencing drought
conditions.  As a deep cyclone pushes the strong cold front
onshore early on Monday, increasingly windy conditions with heavy
coastal rain and mountain snow can be expected to move into the
Pacific Northwest.  Mountain snow is expected to reach into the
northern Rockies by Monday morning.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1229 AM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 151200Z - 161200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level trough will continue eastward from the Plains into
parts of the Midwest today. Across the West, an upper-level ridge
will build. At the surface, a high pressure system will strengthen
within the Great Basin and persist into Saturday.

...Southern California...
Winds have already begun to turn offshore this evening across
southern California. Winds should continue to increase through the
overnight into Friday morning. Winds will peak sometime between
early morning and early afternoon. Poor overnight RH recovery is
expected which means elevated conditions are likely for much of the
period. Winds of 15-20 mph are expected broadly with
terrain-enhanced areas potentially seeing 25-30 mph during the peak
of the event. The most likely areas for critical conditions will be
the higher terrain of Los Angeles/Ventura Counties. However, the
general lack of mid-level wind support, combined with a marginally
critical surface pressure gradient, suggest critical conditions will
be localized.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0103 AM CDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
For Saturday, upper-level ridging will continue to expand across the
West and into the Plains. At the surface, a large anticyclone will
be situated within the Great Basin and much of the Plains.

...Southern California...
The offshore pressure gradient is expected to be slightly weaker
than on Friday morning. However, it appears that elevated fire
weather will persist into Saturday morning as the surface pressure
gradient diurnally maximizes once again. Winds of 15-20 mph will be
most common along with continued areas of low RH. As on Friday,
terrain-favored locations will experience slightly stronger winds.
Winds in all areas should weaken by the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 22 2021

...Overview...

A large surface high should be in place across much of the eastern
U.S. for the beginning of next week, bringing more fall-like
weather compared to the unseasonable warmth and humidity in recent
days.  A storm system is expected to organize across the central
Plains by Tuesday and track in the general direction of the Great
Lakes by around Thursday, with a trailing cold front that should
reach the East Coast by the end of the week.  Meanwhile across the
western U.S., a large scale trough over the northeast Pacific will
increase the potential for unsettled weather for the West Coast
region, with a weakening storm system by midweek and potentially a
stronger storm system to close out the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in good agreement on the
synoptic scale pattern on Monday.  One of the more uncertain
aspects of the forecast has been the timing of the upper low
crossing the Rockies, and the guidance has come into better
agreement compared to the 12Z Thursday guidance in portraying a
slower solution.  The 00Z ECMWF has trended in line with the
slower GFS/UKMET.  At the time of this discussion, the 12Z ECENS
is the most progressive solution here, although this is also
likely to adjust farther to the west.  By the end of the forecast
period, the GFS is more offshore with the West Coast storm system,
and farther east with a closed low over southern Canada compared
to the ECMWF/CMC.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/CMC blend through the majority of the forecast period,
with increasing contributions from the ensemble means by Thursday
and Friday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Valley rain and mountain snow associated with the potential closed
low over the northern Rockies on Monday is expected to reach the
northern Plains by midweek, with perhaps up to an inch of rain on
the north side of the surface low across portions of northern
Nebraska and South Dakota, and several inches of snow across the
higher terrain of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  Showers and storms
will likely increase in coverage ahead of the trailing cold front
from Texas to the Ohio Valley, and this should reach the
Appalachians by Thursday as the front steadily progresses
eastward.  The next storm system reaching the West Coast by the
end of the week will likely bring moderate to locally heavy rain
for coastal areas from northern California to the Olympic
Peninsula, although placement specifics for heaviest rainfall
remain uncertain.

Temperatures are expected to be 10-20 degrees below normal to
start the week across portions of California and Nevada in the
wake of the cold front, and about 5-15 degrees above normal across
the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.  The cooler readings reach
the Plains by midweek with the Ohio Valley and East Coast region
getting a modest warm-up ahead of the next front, with anomalies
only on the order of 5 to 10 degrees above normal.  By the end of
the week, most locations should be within 5 degrees of their
climatological averages with perhaps some greater warm anomalies
over portions of Montana and Idaho.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
251 AM EDT Fri Oct 15 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Oct 18 2021 - 12Z Fri Oct 22 2021

...Overview...

A large surface high should be in place across much of the eastern
U.S. for the beginning of next week, bringing more fall-like
weather compared to the unseasonable warmth and humidity in recent
days.  A storm system is expected to organize across the central
Plains by Tuesday and track in the general direction of the Great
Lakes by around Thursday, with a trailing cold front that should
reach the East Coast by the end of the week.  Meanwhile across the
western U.S., a large scale trough over the northeast Pacific will
increase the potential for unsettled weather for the West Coast
region, with a weakening storm system by midweek and potentially a
stronger storm system to close out the week.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Model guidance for the 00Z cycle is in good agreement on the
synoptic scale pattern on Monday.  One of the more uncertain
aspects of the forecast has been the timing of the upper low
crossing the Rockies, and the guidance has come into better
agreement compared to the 12Z Thursday guidance in portraying a
slower solution.  The 00Z ECMWF has trended in line with the
slower GFS/UKMET.  At the time of this discussion, the 12Z ECENS
is the most progressive solution here, although this is also
likely to adjust farther to the west.  By the end of the forecast
period, the GFS is more offshore with the West Coast storm system,
and farther east with a closed low over southern Canada compared
to the ECMWF/CMC.  The WPC forecast was primarily derived from a
GFS/ECMWF/CMC blend through the majority of the forecast period,
with increasing contributions from the ensemble means by Thursday
and Friday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Valley rain and mountain snow associated with the potential closed
low over the northern Rockies on Monday is expected to reach the
northern Plains by midweek, with perhaps up to an inch of rain on
the north side of the surface low across portions of northern
Nebraska and South Dakota, and several inches of snow across the
higher terrain of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming.  Showers and storms
will likely increase in coverage ahead of the trailing cold front
from Texas to the Ohio Valley, and this should reach the
Appalachians by Thursday as the front steadily progresses
eastward.  The next storm system reaching the West Coast by the
end of the week will likely bring moderate to locally heavy rain
for coastal areas from northern California to the Olympic
Peninsula, although placement specifics for heaviest rainfall
remain uncertain.

Temperatures are expected to be 10-20 degrees below normal to
start the week across portions of California and Nevada in the
wake of the cold front, and about 5-15 degrees above normal across
the northern Plains and Upper Midwest.  The cooler readings reach
the Plains by midweek with the Ohio Valley and East Coast region
getting a modest warm-up ahead of the next front, with anomalies
only on the order of 5 to 10 degrees above normal.  By the end of
the week, most locations should be within 5 degrees of their
climatological averages with perhaps some greater warm anomalies
over portions of Montana and Idaho.

...Severe weather and Excessive Rainfall on tap from the Mid-South
to the Great Lakes today; severe storms possible in the Northeast
on Saturday...

...Fresh injection of cooler than normal temperatures overtaking
the Rockies and Heartland arrives in the Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys on Saturday; abnormally warm along the East Coast...

...Elevated fire weather conditions in Southern California; wet
pattern returns to the Pacific Northwest

The primary weather maker to close out the week is an elongated
frontal boundary stretching from southeast Canada to South Texas
that contains a couple waves of low pressure embedded along the
front. The front is set to ignite areas of showers and
thunderstorms throughout the day with some storms potentially
becoming severe. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight
Risk for severe storms from northern Arkansas and through the Ohio
Valley into the eastern Great Lakes today. There is also a
Marginal Risk for Excessive Rainfall in some of these areas that
could lead to localized areas of flash flooding. As an upper
trough tracking through the Midwest amplifies Friday night, one
particular area of low pressure will rapidly deepen as it tracks
from the eastern Great Lakes Friday evening into southeast Canada
on Saturday. The storm system's cold front will swing through the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic producing areas of showers and
thunderstorms on approach. Some storms could be severe in the
Northeast, which has led SPC to issue a Marginal Risk for parts of
the region. The front races into the northwest Atlantic Saturday
night and a dome of high pressure builds in behind it, leading to
the arrival of a drier and seasonally cooler temperatures on
Sunday.

Farther west, a chilly and dry air-mass lies in wake of this
elongated cold front tracking through the eastern half of the
Lower 48. Today, much below normal temperatures are engulfing the
Intermountain West and the Heartland while east of the front, an
air-mass bordering on one observed in late summer remains
entrenched east of the Mississippi River. Numerous daily record
warm minimum temps are likely to be challenged this morning from
South Texas to the Northeast with some daily record highs possible
in the central Appalachians. While the cooler temperatures are not
likely to break many (if any) records, daily temperature
departures of 10 to 20 degrees below normal are anticipated in the
Rockies and the High Plains. The front quickly pushes east on
Saturday, ushering in that drier and more autumn-like temperature
regime from the Great Lakes to the western Gulf Coast. Most of the
East Coast receives a dose of much cooler temperatures by Sunday.

Elsewhere, a strengthening upper level ridge allows for drier and
milder temperatures to set up shop over the western third of the
CONUS. Santa Ana winds in Southern California combined with low
relative humidity levels have led to the issuance of Red Flag
warnings and an Elevated Risk for fire weather conditions. Ridging
over the Intermountain West will keep Santa Ana winds in the
forecast into Saturday, prolonging the favorable fire weather
conditions in place there. Farther north, the coastal areas of the
Pacific Northwest begin to feel the affects of a deepening upper
trough in the northeast Pacific as it delivers subtropical
moisture into western Washington. The Olympics and northern
Cascades are likely to contend with periods of rain just before an
approaching frontal system brings additional rainfall to western
Washington and Oregon on Sunday.

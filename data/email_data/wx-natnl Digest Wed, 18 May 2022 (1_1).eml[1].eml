Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Tue May 17 2022

Valid 171700Z - 181200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF WEST TX INTO EASTERN
NM...

The main change with this update was to expand the Critical area
westward across parts of the Permian Basin into eastern NM. As
strong midlevel flow (sampled by regional 12Z soundings) intercepts
the higher terrain over eastern NM, deep boundary-layer mixing into
the strong flow aloft will support 15-20 mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds (with higher gusts) amid 5-10
percent minimum RH. These conditions, coupled with critical to
near-record dry fuels warrants the expansion of the Critical area.
Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

..Weinman.. 05/17/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Tue May 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
A weak mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the Southwest today.
This will lead to increasing mid-level flow across New Mexico and
the southern High Plains. In addition, lee cyclogenesis is expected
which will tighten the surface pressure gradient across the
Southwest and southern High Plains. As a result, breezy conditions
will develop amid 5 to 13 percent relative humidity. At this time,
the strongest winds are forecast east of the dryline beneath a
strengthening low-level jet. A dry environment with deep mixing is
expected immediately east of the dryline which should allow some of
this stronger flow to mix to the surface.

In addition, some dry and breezy conditions are expected in northern
and northeastern Montana. While fuels remain mostly unreceptive
across Montana, ERC values are nearing or exceeding the 90th
percentile in portions of north-central Montana. Therefore, a small
elevated delineation has been added across this area for this small
region of more favorable fuels.

Thunderstorms are expected to form in the vicinity of a dryline
across west Texas into the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles this afternoon.
These storms will develop in an airmass with PWAT around 0.6 to 0.75
inches. Therefore, these storms should be drier, especially
initially, with the threat for lightning induced fire starts.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 17 2022

SYNOPSIS: Forecast mid-level high pressure predominately favored throughout
the
southern tier of the Lower 48 is expected to promote above-normal temperatu=
res
and possible excessive heat conditions across the southwestern and
south-central U.S.  A stationary front combined with ample moisture advecti=
on
from the Gulf of Mexico may trigger heavy precipitation across the Southeas=
t.
Springtime flooding remains a concern over the Upper Midwest, and across
central and eastern Mainland Alaska.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Central Great Basin,
Southern
Rockies, Southwest, western portions of the Central and Southern Plains, an=
d
California, Wed-Sat, May 25-28.

Slight risk of excessive heat for eastern portions of the Central and South=
ern
Plains, Wed-Tue, May 25-31.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Great Plains, Central and
Southern Rockies, Central Great Basin, and Southwest, Wed-Sun, May 25-29.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys, Southeast, and Mid-Atlantic, Wed-Fri, May 25-27.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible along parts of northern Minnesota.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana River Basin in Mainland Alaska.

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 25 - TUESDAY MAY 31: By the middle of next week, there
continues to be a number of discrepancies in the 500-hPa height forecasts
among
the dynamical models across the U.S. While the 0z GEFS favors a deeper trou=
gh
over the higher elevations of the West, and much of the positive mid-level
height departure coverage remaining offshore in the eastern Pacific and
downstream east of the Mississippi Valley early in the period, the 0z ECMWF
and
Canadian feature a flatter trough over the northwestern CONUS with more
amplified mid-level ridging overspreading the lower latitudes of the CONUS
during this time. This is reflected in the uncalibrated and calibrated
temperature guidance, with the ECMWF reforecast tool maintaining elevated
chances (>40%) of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile mainly
over the southwestern and south-central CONUS. The GEFS remains less on boa=
rd
with this excessive heat potential, indicating lower chances (20-30%) in
percentile space throughout this part of the country. Despite these
differences, a slight chance of excessive heat is maintained for portions o=
f
the Great Basin, Rockies, Southwest, California, and the Central and Southe=
rn
Plains, May 25 to 28, where there is the highest amount of agreement in bot=
h
reforecast tools. This heat potential is further supported by the National
Blend of Models (NBM) analysis which shows a number of locations in the Fou=
r
Corners regions approaching daily maximum temperature records early in week=
-2.
Later in the period, more amplified mid-level troughing is favored by the
ECMWF
ensemble across the West, thereby diminishing the heat potential across the
southwestern CONUS. However, both reforecast tools maintain increased chanc=
es
for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees F mai=
nly
across the Central and Southern Plains ( and >100 degrees F along the Rio
Grande Valley) throughout the period, supporting the continuation of a slig=
ht
risk of excessive heat over the region for the entirety of week-2.



With mean surface low pressure continuing to be favored in the lee of the
Rockies in the ensembles, a slight risk of episodes of high winds remains
posted for parts of the Great Plains, Central and Southern Rockies, Central
Great Basin, and Southwest, May 25 to 29. This is also supported in the
reforecast tools which indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceed=
ing
the 85th percentile and 20 mph across much of the West. The continued
potential
for high winds, combined with anticipated dry and hot conditions during
week-2,
is likely to sustain an elevated wildfire risk across many parts of the Fou=
r
Corners region where multiple large wildfires are currently ongoing. The
Hermits Peak and Calf Canyon fire located east of Santa Fe, continues to be
the
largest wildfire incident in the West and has burned approximately 300,000
acres with nearly a quarter of the incident contained (as of May 17).



The hazards outlook for precipitation is quite challenging today, as there =
are
significant differences in the uncalibrated guidance between the GEFS and
ECMWF
which are most likely tied to the presence/absence of an area of low pressu=
re
in the Gulf of Mexico that is of tropical origin. The deterministic GFS and
GEFS ensemble have been steadfast with this tropical potential for several
days, resulting in the highest expected daily precipitation amounts across =
the
southeastern CONUS early in the period. The uncalibrated ECMWF remains less
supportive of this scenario, while also favoring increased, and potentially
heavy precipitation further north across the Midwest associated with anothe=
r
area of surface low pressure tracking across the northeastern CONUS during =
the
first few days in the period. The Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) day 7
surface analysis continues to feature a stationary front extending across t=
he
Gulf Coast and Florida. Regardless of tropical activity, this feature combi=
ned
with ample moist southerly flow from the Gulf of Mexico is conducive for th=
e
enhancement of precipitation across the southeastern CONUS. Given some
agreement in the reforecast tools indicating at least 20% chance of 3-day
accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch over the region, a
slight risk of precipitation is issued over the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee
Valleys, Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic for May 25-27.



Over the north-central CONUS, there is ongoing flooding in the Red River
Valley
of the North, neighboring parts of the James River basin, and northern
Minnesota due to antecedent above-normal precipitation and seasonal snowmel=
t.
With above-normal precipitation favored during the next two weeks across th=
e
north-central CONUS, the flooding risk is likely to persist into week-2, th=
us
the corresponding flooding possible areas remain posted in today's outlook.
Across Alaska, below-normal temperatures are predominately favored througho=
ut
much of the Mainland. Although anomalously cold temperatures may slow the r=
ate
of springtime snowmelt and ice-river breakup, above freezing temperatures
supports the continuation of a possible flood hazard across Tanana Basin in
Mainland Alaska, primarily in areas that have above normal snowpack.

...Record Heat from the South to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday
and Saturday...

...Heavy Rainfall and Severe Weather Threat to focus over the
East-Central U.S. Friday and Saturday...

...Heavy Snow Threat for the Central Rockies/High Plains Friday...


...Overview...

The overall pattern across the lower 48 will amplify again by the
start of the medium range period on Friday with a digging trough
over the West/north-central U.S. and rising heights in the East.
This yields cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in the
West and a continued hot regime for the South and East late this
week. A deepening low pressure system tracking from the northern
tier/Upper Great Lakes into Canada will push a strong cold front
eastward, with increasing chances for heavy rainfall and severe
weather along and ahead of it. Lead southern stream impulses will
add to convective rainfall potential across the South. The main
front/trough will reach the East this weekend as the guidance
continues to be very uncertain with details upstream across the
Northwest into early next week. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Overall, guidance continues to show a more open shortwave across
the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley on Friday with the
models also showing decent agreement (with some minor timing
differences) on amplified troughing sliding into the East by late
weekend. However, the 00 UTC ECMWF in particular also places more
emphasis on a southern stream impulses ejecting underneath across
the South along with heavier convective rainfall across the
South/Southeast this weekend into Monday. The 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF
support this emphasis.

By Sunday, the most prominent source of uncertainty continues to
be flow evolution across the West. The GFS and many GEFS members
continue to be much stronger/more pronounced with energy on the
backside of the trailing trough into the West this weekend, which
eventually results in another fairly amplified shortwave into the
south-central U.S. early next week. On the other extreme, recent
runs of the ECMWF are rather flat/more ridgy with the flow over
the West late period. This all seems to stem from differences in
how quickly energy from the North Pacific moves into western North
America. The ECMWF is much faster to break down the East Pacific
ridge which allows the energy to slide inland, while the GFS tends
to maintain a more blocky ridge allowing for more amplification
downstream across the West. The ensemble means themselves seem to
agree with their deterministic counterparts, although there are a
fair number of members showing both possibilities. This aspect of
the forecast remains very uncertain, with WPC progs suggesting a
solution a bit closer to the GFS/GEFS.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
general blend of the deterministic models through day 5 along with
the NBM and a transition towards the ensemble means days 6-7 along
with the GFS/ECMWF for a little more definition to individual
systems.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break into the weekend as record heat
spreads into the East. Numerous daily records could be met or
exceeded still Friday across Texas/Louisiana and the Southeast,
with record values reaching the Upper Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday into the
weekend. A strong cold front will spread for rain and
thunderstorms to spread through the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley/Mississippi Valley on Friday and into the East on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall as well as severe weather is possible along this
boundary given above normal moisture and instability present.
Flooding and flash flooding could be an issue as well,
particularly in places that may be sensitive to additional
rainfall given wet antecedent conditions. Lead southern stream
impulse energy may also focus heavy rainfall areas underneath over
the South. Behind this front, unseasonably cool temperatures will
move from the Rockies into the north-central U.S., lowering snow
levels across the Rockies. There is a threat of heavy snow over
the central Rockies into Friday and even some snow into the
adjacent High Plains. Additional shortwave digging into the
south-central U.S. into next week may re-kindle
convection/rainfall, albeit with less certainty at these longer
time frames. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this week but
may see some moisture return during the weekend or early next
week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0210 PM CDT Tue May 17 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

An Elevated area was added over parts of central into northwest
Texas. Here, sustained southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph are
expected -- aided by a modest pressure gradient peripheral to a weak
surface low and a strong low-level jet. Along and east of a dryline
extending southward from the surface low, sufficient boundary-layer
mixing amid mostly clear skies and shallow/weakly modified Gulf
moisture will support 20-25 percent minimum RH. Given the presence
of dry fuels across the area, elevated fire-weather conditions will
be possible. From the TX Trans-Pecos region into the Permian Basin,
RH will drop into the single digits to lower teens during the
afternoon, though sustained southwesterly surface winds should
generally remain below 15 mph.

Over parts of the Northeast (particularly ME), a dry/breezy
post-frontal airmass will favor west-northwesterly surface winds
around 15-20 mph and 25-30 percent minimum RH during the afternoon.
However, recent (and ongoing) precipitation casts uncertainty on
fuel receptiveness -- precluding highlights at this time.

Across the Southeast, 20-30 percent minimum RH should develop during
peak heating, though sustained surface winds should generally remain
below 15 mph where the driest conditions are expected.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast (see below) remains on track.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0136 AM CDT Tue May 17 2022/

...Synopsis...
Weak high pressure will build into the Southwest on Wednesday with
weak flow aloft. This should keep wind concerns mostly muted across
the region. Dry and breezy conditions are possible across portions
of southern and southeast Wyoming, but fuels are not that dry in
this region.

Some dry thunderstorms are possible across portions of southern
Colorado and northeast New Mexico on Wednesday. Most CAM guidance
shows isolated to scattered storms developing on the higher terrain
before moving eastward in an environment with PWAT around 0.6
inches. Therefore, these storms should be dry and may result in new
fire starts.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue May 17 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 23 - 27 2022

Today's model solutions are in fairly good agreement in predicting a 500-hP=
a
height pattern consistent with the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation
(AO) during the 6-10 day period. Below normal heights are forecast across m=
ost
of the higher latitudes of North America with troughs extending southward t=
o
eastern Alaska and the north-central CONUS. A ridge is forecast near the co=
ast
of California, with positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending eastward in=
to
the southwestern CONUS. Ridging and positive 500-hPa height anomalies are a=
lso
forecast over the eastern CONUS. The 0Z and 6Z GEFS ensemble means predict =
a
deeper trough into the south-central CONUS, compared to the ECMWF ensemble
mean. The flow pattern over the CONUS is generally predicted to become more
zonal later in the period. Farther to the north, troughing is forecast acro=
ss
much of Mainland Alaska, while ridging is predicted upstream over the
Aleutians.

Troughing over eastern Alaska into the North Pacific with associated negati=
ve
500-hPa height anomalies favor below normal temperatures for much of northe=
rn
and eastern Alaska and most of the Pacific Northwest into the Northern
Rockies.
Troughing and anomalous northerly flow into the north-central CONUS favor
below
normal temperatures for much of this region. Above normal temperatures are
favored for the Aleutians and southwestern Mainland Alaska, under a predict=
ed
ridge. Above normal temperatures are favored for much of the southwestern
CONUS
under a predicted ridge and positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Elevated abo=
ve
normal temperature probabilities extend into parts of the Southern and Cent=
ral
Plains and across the Gulf Coast region, consistent with predicted near to
above average heights across the southern tier of the CONUS and with the
temperature consolidation tool. Near normal temperatures are favored over m=
uch
of the eastern CONUS, where tools are less consistent and there is greater
uncertainty.

Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for the Aleutians and
southwestern Mainland Alaska, under a forecast ridge. Above normal
precipitation is slightly favored for eastern interior Mainland Alaska and =
the
Alaska Panhandle, under and ahead of predicted troughing. Above normal
precipitation is favored for the Pacific Northwest, under and ahead of the
trough over the North Pacific, while below normal precipitation is favored
across most of the Southwestern CONUS, outside of climatologically dry area=
s,
under a predicted ridge. Enhanced moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexic=
o
and the Atlantic leads to a tilt in probabilities towards above normal
precipitation across most of the eastern half of the CONUS, consistent with
most dynamical model precipitation tools.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
fairly
good agreement on the circulation pattern early in the period offset by
reduced
anomalies and increasing uncertainty later in the period, as well as
differences between the GEFS and ECMWF temperature forecasts for the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 25 - 31 2022

Week-2 dynamical model circulation forecasts show increased uncertainty and
weak mean anomalies relative to the 6-10 day period forecast. Overall, the
predicted circulation pattern during the 8-14 day period is similar to the =
6-
10
day period forecast with a reduction in anomalies and other small changes. =
The
ridge over the Aleutians progresses slightly eastward in the week-2 period.
The
ridge near the Pacific Coast of the CONUS flattens relative to the 6-10 day
period, as the flow becomes more zonal. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies o=
ver
the northwestern CONUS increase slightly relative to the 6-10 day period, a=
s
the ridge to the south flattens. Positive 500-hPa height anomalies extend o=
ver
a larger area of the eastern CONUS in week-2 dynamical model forecasts
relative
to the 6-10 day period forecasts.

Above normal temperatures continue to be slightly favored for the Aleutians
and
parts of extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska, under the forecast ridge. Be=
low
normal temperatures are favored across eastern Mainland Alaska and the Alas=
ka
Panhandle, under a predicted trough. The probability of below normal
temperatures is significantly enhanced over the Pacific Northwest into the
northern High Plains, under decreasing mid-level heights. Near to below nor=
mal
temperatures continue to be favored for the north-central CONUS, associated
with a predicted trough. Enhanced probabilities for above normal temperatur=
es
expand across much of the eastern CONUS in week-2, consistent with most
dynamical model temperature tools, as mid-level heights are predicted to
increase.

Below normal precipitation continues to be favored for the Aleutians and
extreme southwestern Mainland Alaska under a predicted ridge. Above normal
precipitation is favored over northeastern and interior Mainland Alaska and
the
Alaska Panhandle, ahead of a trough forecast near the west coast of Mainlan=
d
Alaska. Near to below normal precipitation is favored for much of the
southwestern CONUS into parts of the Southern and Central Plains, under and
ahead of the mean ridge predicted near California. Above normal precipitati=
on
is indicated for parts of the Central Rockies due to potential trough
development over the southwestern CONUS toward the middle and end of the
period. Above normal precipitation is favored across the northern tier of t=
he
CONUS, consistent with dynamical model precipitation tools. Slightly elevat=
ed
probabilities of above normal precipitation are predicted for most of easte=
rn
CONUS and along the Gulf Coast, due to a predicted frontal boundary and the
potential for enhanced flow of moisture from the Gulf.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered=
 on
Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 35=
%
of
Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
predicted weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the forecast domain an=
d
weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools over most regions.

FORECASTER: D Collins

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Strong to severe thunderstorms and flash flooding likely over
portions of central Plains to the mid-Upper Mississippi Valley
into tonight, then re-develop over the northern Plains/upper
Midwest by Thursday...

...Record breaking heat to persist across the southern Plains,
expanding eastward into the Southeast by Thursday...

...Critical Fire risk continues over the southern High Plains into
west-central Texas...

A low pressure system interacting with a pair of frontal systems
will be the main focus for showers and thunderstorms to develop
and track across the central Plains toward the Midwest into
tonight.  Areas most favorable to severe thunderstorms, heavy
rainfall, and possible flash flooding will be from eastern
Nebraska and Kansas into northern Missouri.  The highest threat of
strong thunderstorms and heavy rain will shift east into the Ohio
Valley and the central Appalachians on Wednesday as the low
pressure center tracks across the lower Great Lakes and a warm
front lifts across the region.  This system is forecast to weaken
further on Thursday, with a general area of showers and
thunderstorms sliding across the Northeast, while scattered
thunderstorms move across the Mid-Atlantic.

Moisture ahead of a rapidly intensifying low pressure system is
forecast to reach the Pacific Northwest by Wednesday morning.  A
new round of coastal/lower elevation rain as well as mountain snow
over the northern Cascades is forecast to persist into Thursday.
The rain/snow is expected to quickly reach into the northern
Rockies through Wednesday night as a cold upper trough arrives,
triggering the formation of a low pressure system over the
northern High Plains into the Canadian Prairies.  Showers and
thunderstorms will likely expand quickly across the northern
Plains on Thursday with the chance of severe thunderstorms and
heavy rain shifting from the northern Plains toward the Midwest by
the afternoon.

Meanwhile, relatively warm, persistently dry and windy conditions
will contribute to a critical fire weather threat over
west-central Texas.

Record breaking heat is expected to expand beneath a ridge of high
pressure situated over the southern Plains toward the Southeast
through late week. Widespread high temperature records are
forecast to be tied or broken in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana
through Thursday. Highs in Texas are likely to be in the 90s and
100s over the next several days, which will pose a health risk to
those who are heat sensitive or are without adequate air
conditioning. There will be little relief over night when lows
will only drop into the upper 60s and 70s. High temperatures will
be between 20-30 degrees above average for much of central
Texas/Oklahoma during this period.

...Record Heat from the South to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday
and Saturday...

...Heavy Rainfall and Severe Weather Threat to focus over the
East-Central U.S. Friday and Saturday...

...Heavy Snow Threat for the Central Rockies/High Plains Friday...


...Overview...

The overall pattern across the lower 48 will amplify again by the
start of the medium range period on Friday with a digging trough
over the West/north-central U.S. and rising heights in the East.
This yields cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in the
West and a continued hot regime for the South and East late this
week. A deepening low pressure system tracking from the northern
tier/Upper Great Lakes into Canada will push a strong cold front
eastward, with increasing chances for heavy rainfall and severe
weather along and ahead of it. Lead southern stream impulses will
add to convective rainfall potential across the South. The main
front/trough will reach the East this weekend as the guidance
continues to be very uncertain with details upstream across the
Northwest into early next week. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Overall, guidance continues to show a more open shortwave across
the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley on Friday with the
models also showing decent agreement (with some minor timing
differences) on amplified troughing sliding into the East by late
weekend. However, the 00 UTC ECMWF in particular also places more
emphasis on a southern stream impulses ejecting underneath across
the South along with heavier convective rainfall across the
South/Southeast this weekend into Monday. The 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF
support this emphasis.

By Sunday, the most prominent source of uncertainty continues to
be flow evolution across the West. The GFS and many GEFS members
continue to be much stronger/more pronounced with energy on the
backside of the trailing trough into the West this weekend, which
eventually results in another fairly amplified shortwave into the
south-central U.S. early next week. On the other extreme, recent
runs of the ECMWF are rather flat/more ridgy with the flow over
the West late period. This all seems to stem from differences in
how quickly energy from the North Pacific moves into western North
America. The ECMWF is much faster to break down the East Pacific
ridge which allows the energy to slide inland, while the GFS tends
to maintain a more blocky ridge allowing for more amplification
downstream across the West. The ensemble means themselves seem to
agree with their deterministic counterparts, although there are a
fair number of members showing both possibilities. This aspect of
the forecast remains very uncertain, with WPC progs suggesting a
solution a bit closer to the GFS/GEFS.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
general blend of the deterministic models through day 5 along with
the NBM and a transition towards the ensemble means days 6-7 along
with the GFS/ECMWF for a little more definition to individual
systems.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break into the weekend as record heat
spreads into the East. Numerous daily records could be met or
exceeded still Friday across Texas/Louisiana and the Southeast,
with record values reaching the Upper Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday into the
weekend. A strong cold front will spread for rain and
thunderstorms to spread through the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley/Mississippi Valley on Friday and into the East on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall as well as severe weather is possible along this
boundary given above normal moisture and instability present.
Flooding and flash flooding could be an issue as well,
particularly in places that may be sensitive to additional
rainfall given wet antecedent conditions. Lead southern stream
impulse energy may also focus heavy rainfall areas underneath over
the South. Behind this front, unseasonably cool temperatures will
move from the Rockies into the north-central U.S., lowering snow
levels across the Rockies. There is a threat of heavy snow over
the central Rockies into Friday and even some snow into the

Extended Forecast Discussion

505 PM EDT Tue May 17 2022

Valid 12Z Fri May 20 2022 - 12Z Tue May 24 2022

...Record Heat from the South to the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday
and Saturday...

...Heavy Rainfall and Severe Weather Threat to focus over the
East-Central U.S. Friday and Saturday...

...Heavy Snow Threat for the Central Rockies/High Plains Friday...


...Overview...

The overall pattern across the lower 48 will amplify again by the
start of the medium range period on Friday with a digging trough
over the West/north-central U.S. and rising heights in the East.
This yields cooler temperatures and lowering snow levels in the
West and a continued hot regime for the South and East late this
week. A deepening low pressure system tracking from the northern
tier/Upper Great Lakes into Canada will push a strong cold front
eastward, with increasing chances for heavy rainfall and severe
weather along and ahead of it. Lead southern stream impulses will
add to convective rainfall potential across the South. The main
front/trough will reach the East this weekend as the guidance
continues to be very uncertain with details upstream across the
Northwest into early next week. A northward surge of tropical
moisture will also increase rain/thunderstorm chances across
Florida late this week and into the weekend.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Overall, guidance continues to show a more open shortwave across
the northern Plains/upper Mississippi Valley on Friday with the
models also showing decent agreement (with some minor timing
differences) on amplified troughing sliding into the East by late
weekend. However, the 00 UTC ECMWF in particular also places more
emphasis on a southern stream impulses ejecting underneath across
the South along with heavier convective rainfall across the
South/Southeast this weekend into Monday. The 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF
support this emphasis.

By Sunday, the most prominent source of uncertainty continues to
be flow evolution across the West. The GFS and many GEFS members
continue to be much stronger/more pronounced with energy on the
backside of the trailing trough into the West this weekend, which
eventually results in another fairly amplified shortwave into the
south-central U.S. early next week. On the other extreme, recent
runs of the ECMWF are rather flat/more ridgy with the flow over
the West late period. This all seems to stem from differences in
how quickly energy from the North Pacific moves into western North
America. The ECMWF is much faster to break down the East Pacific
ridge which allows the energy to slide inland, while the GFS tends
to maintain a more blocky ridge allowing for more amplification
downstream across the West. The ensemble means themselves seem to
agree with their deterministic counterparts, although there are a
fair number of members showing both possibilities. This aspect of
the forecast remains very uncertain, with WPC progs suggesting a
solution a bit closer to the GFS/GEFS.

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
general blend of the deterministic models through day 5 along with
the NBM and a transition towards the ensemble means days 6-7 along
with the GFS/ECMWF for a little more definition to individual
systems.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break into the weekend as record heat
spreads into the East. Numerous daily records could be met or
exceeded still Friday across Texas/Louisiana and the Southeast,
with record values reaching the Upper Ohio
Valley/Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Friday into the
weekend. A strong cold front will spread for rain and
thunderstorms to spread through the Great Lakes/Ohio
Valley/Mississippi Valley on Friday and into the East on Saturday.
Heavy rainfall as well as severe weather is possible along this
boundary given above normal moisture and instability present.
Flooding and flash flooding could be an issue as well,
particularly in places that may be sensitive to additional
rainfall given wet antecedent conditions. Lead southern stream
impulse energy may also focus heavy rainfall areas underneath over
the South. Behind this front, unseasonably cool temperatures will
move from the Rockies into the north-central U.S., lowering snow
levels across the Rockies. There is a threat of heavy snow over
the central Rockies into Friday and even some snow into the
adjacent High Plains. Additional shortwave digging into the
south-central U.S. into next week may re-kindle
convection/rainfall, albeit with less certainty at these longer
time frames. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this week but
may see some moisture return during the weekend or early next
week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0143 AM CDT Wed May 18 2022

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...Synopsis...
Flow will be weak across the Southwest today. A weak mid-level
shortwave trough will cross the southern High Plains and lead to
weak cyclogenesis across northwest Texas. This will result in a
strengthening low-level jet east of the surface low. Some deep
mixing is expected east of the dryline across central Texas beneath
this low-level jet. This will bring some of this stronger flow to
the surface in a region with 20 to 25 percent relative humidity. ERC
values are 90 to 95th percentile across this region and visible
satellite showed several smoke plumes this afternoon, indicating
fuels are sufficiently dry for burning.

Dry conditions are expected in the Southeast (20 to 25 percent
relative humidity). However, winds are expected to stay light across
the region which should preclude any significant fire weather
concerns.

In addition, thunderstorms are expected across portions of the
central Rockies this afternoon. These thunderstorms will occur in a
low PWAT environment (0.6 to 0.75 inches) and in a region with very
dry fuels. Therefore, storms should be dry with the potential for
new lightning induced fire starts.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
...Southwest into the Southern/Central High Plains...
Strong lee cyclogenesis is expected across the central Plains on
Thursday as a strong mid-level jet traverses the Inter-Mountain
West. This will result in a tightening pressure gradient and strong
winds across much of the central CONUS. These strong winds will
overlap the very dry airmass across the Southwest and lead to
critical fire weather conditions from southeast Nevada into
southeast Colorado and the far western OK/TX Panhandles. Some dry
and breezy conditions are possible across southeast Wyoming into
central Nebraska, but fuels appear to be moist enough to preclude
fire weather concerns.

...Northeast Montana...
Very windy conditions are expected across eastern Montana Thursday
afternoon with sustained winds around 30 mph expected. In addition,
relative humidity is expected to drop into the low to mid 20s.
However, guidance has overestimated relative humidity the last
several days, so it could be even drier. Most fuels have greened up
across this region, but it has been over a week since wetting rain
has fallen in the region. Therefore, fuels are mostly moist, but may
be starting to dry out in spots. Therefore, with critical fire
weather conditions expected and marginally dry fuels, decided an
Elevated delineation was most appropriate across this region.

...Northern Sacramento Valley and nearby Foothills...
A tight pressure gradient will develop across northern California
Thursday afternoon. This will bring strong northerly winds to the
Sacramento Valley. Fuels are still moist in the higher terrain, but
have started to cure below 2000 feet. Therefore, there will be some
concerns for large fires in the foothills surrounding the northern
Sacramento Valley as winds increase to around 20 mph with around 15
percent relative humidity.

...Record Heat in parts of the East on Saturday ...

...Heavy Rainfall and Severe Weather Threat to focus over the
East-Central U.S. this weekend...


...Overview...

A rather amplified pattern will be in place by the start of the
medium range period with a digging trough over the
West/north-central U.S. and strong ridging in the East. This
yields cooler temperatures across the Rockies and central U.S. and
record heat in the East into the weekend. A strong cold front
across the Midwest and East this weekend will result in increased
chances for heavy rainfall and severe weather along and ahead of
it. A northward surge of tropical moisture will also increase
rain/thunderstorm chances across Florida this weekend as well. By
Sunday into Monday, another shortwave should enter the West Coast
with very uncertain details as it pushes east and also with
additional energy upstream around next Wednesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The models are showing increasing agreement on the shortwave into
the upper Mississippi Valley on Saturday and amplified troughing
tracking into the East on Sunday. A general model blend seems to
handle this fine. As early as Sunday-Monday however, details
regarding flow over the West become highly uncertain. Models agree
the next shortwave should cross through the Northwest on Sunday,
but the ECMWF/ECENS mean continue to be quite a bit weaker and
faster compared the GFS and CMC which favor amplification of the
shortwave over the West and thus a much slower progression (and
consequently a better tapping of Gulf moisture and precip across
the central U.S. early next week). This all seems to stem from
differences in how quickly energy from the North Pacific moves
into western North America. The ECMWF is much faster to break down
the East Pacific ridge which allows the energy to slide inland,
while the GFS tends to maintain a more blocky ridge allowing for
more amplification downstream across the West. The ensemble means
themselves seem to agree with their deterministic counterparts,
with deterministic models also showing plenty of run to run
discontinuities. Given the uncertainty, the WPC forecast for
tonight stayed close to continuity which seems to side slightly
more towards the slower/stronger GFS/CMC/GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break by this weekend though record heat
continues into Saturday across the East. Numerous daily records
could be met or exceeded on Saturday across the Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast with a few lingering records across
far southern regions in Texas/Louisiana. A strong cold front will
spread rain and thunderstorms through the Mississippi Valley/Ohio
Valley on Saturday and into the East on Sunday. Heavy rainfall as
well as severe weather is possible along this boundary given above
normal moisture and instability present. Flooding and flash
flooding could be an issue as well, particularly in places that
may be sensitive to additional rainfall given wet antecedent
conditions. Lead southern stream impulse energy may also focus
heavy rainfall areas underneath over the South. Behind this front,
unseasonably cool temperatures will move from the Rockies into the
north-central U.S., lowering snow levels across the Rockies. There
is a threat of heavy snow over the central Rockies into Friday and
even some snow into the adjacent High Plains. Additional shortwave
digging into the south-central U.S. into next week may re-kindle
convection/rainfall, albeit with less certainty at these longer
time frames. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this week but
may see some moisture return during the weekend or early next
week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

...Record Heat in parts of the East on Saturday ...

...Heavy Rainfall and Severe Weather Threat to focus over the
East-Central U.S. this weekend...


...Overview...

A rather amplified pattern will be in place by the start of the
medium range period with a digging trough over the
West/north-central U.S. and strong ridging in the East. This
yields cooler temperatures across the Rockies and central U.S. and
record heat in the East into the weekend. A strong cold front
across the Midwest and East this weekend will result in increased
chances for heavy rainfall and severe weather along and ahead of
it. A northward surge of tropical moisture will also increase
rain/thunderstorm chances across Florida this weekend as well. By
Sunday into Monday, another shortwave should enter the West Coast
with very uncertain details as it pushes east and also with
additional energy upstream around next Wednesday.


...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The models are showing increasing agreement on the shortwave into
the upper Mississippi Valley on Saturday and amplified troughing
tracking into the East on Sunday. A general model blend seems to
handle this fine. As early as Sunday-Monday however, details
regarding flow over the West become highly uncertain. Models agree
the next shortwave should cross through the Northwest on Sunday,
but the ECMWF/ECENS mean continue to be quite a bit weaker and
faster compared the GFS and CMC which favor amplification of the
shortwave over the West and thus a much slower progression (and
consequently a better tapping of Gulf moisture and precip across
the central U.S. early next week). This all seems to stem from
differences in how quickly energy from the North Pacific moves
into western North America. The ECMWF is much faster to break down
the East Pacific ridge which allows the energy to slide inland,
while the GFS tends to maintain a more blocky ridge allowing for
more amplification downstream across the West. The ensemble means
themselves seem to agree with their deterministic counterparts,
with deterministic models also showing plenty of run to run
discontinuities. Given the uncertainty, the WPC forecast for
tonight stayed close to continuity which seems to side slightly
more towards the slower/stronger GFS/CMC/GEFS mean.


...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The relentless heat across the Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi
Valley should finally break by this weekend though record heat
continues into Saturday across the East. Numerous daily records
could be met or exceeded on Saturday across the Appalachians,
Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast with a few lingering records across
far southern regions in Texas/Louisiana. A strong cold front will
spread rain and thunderstorms through the Mississippi Valley/Ohio
Valley on Saturday and into the East on Sunday. Heavy rainfall as
well as severe weather is possible along this boundary given above
normal moisture and instability present. Flooding and flash
flooding could be an issue as well, particularly in places that
may be sensitive to additional rainfall given wet antecedent
conditions. Lead southern stream impulse energy may also focus
heavy rainfall areas underneath over the South. Behind this front,
unseasonably cool temperatures will move from the Rockies into the
north-central U.S., lowering snow levels across the Rockies. There
is a threat of heavy snow over the central Rockies into Friday and
even some snow into the adjacent High Plains. Additional shortwave
digging into the south-central U.S. into next week may re-kindle
convection/rainfall, albeit with less certainty at these longer
time frames. The Northwest will be fairly dry late this week but
may see some moisture return during the weekend or early next
week, with uncertain flow details keeping confidence low for
specifics of timing/coverage/amounts of any precipitation. The
southern half of the West should see a warming trend expand from
west to east Saturday-Monday with California seeing the warmest
high temperature anomalies of plus 10-15F. Elsewhere, guidance
agrees that tropical moisture should surge northward across the
Florida peninsula late this week into the weekend, bringing a
round of heavy rainfall to portions of the Sunshine State.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding expected over portions
of the lower Ohio Valley today...

...Flash flooding concerns for portions of the Northern Plains and
Upper Midwest on Thursday...

...Record breaking heat continues in Southern/Central Plains; East
begins to warm up; cold air surges through Northwest...

...Critical Risk of Fires over portions of the Southwest into the
Central/Southern Plains on Thursday...

Showers and thunderstorms will focus around a low pressure system
moving through the Midwest/Ohio Valley today. Localized heavy
rainfall leading to flash flooding is possible over much of
Kentucky, where a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in effect.
Some thunderstorms may turn severe, especially over west-central
Kentucky where a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect.
Wind and hail will be the primary threats with storms that
materialize. Additional severe thunderstorm activity is marginally
possible along the attendant cold front over portions of the
Middle Mississippi Valley, around an upstream system moving
through eastern North Dakota and the Upper Midwest, and another
system gliding across the eastern Colorado and the Southern
Plains.

A deep low pressure system will weaken as it enters the Pacific
Northwest, spreading showers and thunderstorms across coastal
Washington/Oregon and the Northern Rockies today. This system will
re-intensify over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest on
Thursday, where it's forecast to generate rain and thunderstorms.
Some rainfall, particularly over portions of northeastern North
Dakota and northwestern Minnesota, will be heavy enough to produce
flash flooding. A Slight Risk of excessive rainfall leading to
flash flooding is in effect for this area as a result. Severe
thunderstorms may develop over central/northern Iowa, southern
Minnesota and central/northern Wisconsin Thursday afternoon into
Thursday evening. A Slight Risk of Severe thunderstorms is in
effect for those areas with the main threats being large hail,
damaging wind gusts and a couple of tornadoes. Cold air surges
through the Northwest on the backside of the aforementioned system
today and Thursday before arriving in the Central Rockies and
Northern/Central Plains on Friday.

Upper-level ridging will continue a trend of record warmth in the
Central/Southern Plains over the next couple of days. High
temperatures in the 90s and 100s will be 20-30 degrees above
average for many parts of north-central Texas, Oklahoma and the
Central Plains through Thursday. These temperatures will either
tie or break many existing records. There will be little respite
for parts of north-central Texas and central Oklahoma in the
evenings as lows are forecast to remain in the 70s over the next
couple of days. A retrograding ridge will jut into the Southeast
from the western Atlantic late Thursday into Friday leading the
East Coast to experience a significant warm up heading into the
weekend. Much of the West will be warmer than normal today and
Thursday, as well. Strong winds will overlap a very dry airmass
over the Southwest leading to a Critical Risk of fire weather for
much of the 4 corners region on Thursday.

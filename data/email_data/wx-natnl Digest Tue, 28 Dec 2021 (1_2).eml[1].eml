Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1048 AM CST Mon Dec 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

Today's forecast of elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions across the central/southern High Plains remains on track,
with only minor adjustments needed based on the latest ensemble
model guidance.

Please the previous discussion below for more information on today's
fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0106 AM CST Mon Dec 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early-morning surface observations across the High Plains/Southern
Plains show poor overnight RH recovery (with RH values in the teens
to 30s) after strong downslope winds Sunday afternoon. Further
north, surface pressure rises are noted across the Plains in the
wake of a departing surface low, indicating building high pressure
that will keep the dry air mass in place for today. Aloft,
southwesterly flow is expected to gradually weaken, but will
maintain a strong enough zonal component for modest lee troughing
this afternoon. The resultant pressure gradient will induce breezy
winds along the High Plains on the western periphery of the dry air
mass, yielding fire weather concerns for a region with antecedent
dry fuels.

...Central High Plains...
Guidance continues to show reasonably high agreement in southerly
winds increasing to 15-25 mph from eastern CO/western KS into the NE
Panhandle. While most ensemble members suggest RH reductions to 20%
are probable, drier conditions with RH values in the teens are more
likely to the east across central KS/southern NE where winds will be
somewhat weaker. This slight displacement of the lowest RH and
strongest winds, in conjunction with modest boundary-layer flow and
increasing afternoon clouds, yields low confidence in the potential
for widespread critical conditions (though localized/transient
critical conditions will likely evolve within this region).

...Eastern New Mexico...
Across eastern NM, downslope winds combined with warm temperatures
under the low-level thermal ridge will likely result in a few hours
of elevated wind/RH conditions. Although afternoon cloud cover casts
some uncertainty into the forecast, strong model consensus and
receptive fuels warrant the southward expansion.

...Western Oklahoma...
Winds are forecast to increase during the morning hours as the
pressure gradient temporarily tightens across the southern Plains.
This may result in areas of 20-25% RH with 15 mph winds by around 18
UTC. However, the regional pressure gradient is expected to weaken
through the afternoon during peak diurnal warming, which will limit
the duration of the fire weather threat.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

A blocky and amplified ridge/upper high anchored over the northern
Pacific through late this week will continue to support western
U.S. upper trough reinforcement and chilly weather. A separate
piece of energy within the larger scale trough should track a
little offshore southern California Thursday-Friday. Expect the
pattern to change after Friday as a new upper ridge builds farther
west, leading to a deepening trough over the Northeast Pacific and
renewed moisture feed into the Northwest U.S. Meanwhile this
pattern shift will kick out the late week western trough that will
ultimately support a widespread area of precipitation across the
eastern half of the country in association with organized low
pressure/fronts. A much weaker wavy frontal system will depart
from the East late this week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The spread among the 00Z/06Z models and ensembles, as well as the
preferred forecast approach and resulting system evolution, are
fairly similar to the previous cycle. An operational blend looks
good early in the period with a gradual increase of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means later in the forecast (reaching 40 percent
total by day 7 Monday) helping to tone down lower-predictability
differences.

Through the period there are various embedded detail uncertainties
within a more agreeable mean evolution. On Thursday-Friday
differences are noticeable with the evolution/timing of the energy
off southern California, with the 12Z GFS/UKMET/CMC all suggesting
the 00Z ECMWF may be too slow and closed as northern stream energy
digs down from the north. The 12Z ECMWF has indeed trended
somewhat faster. Either way the overall pattern returns to fairly
good agreement by Saturday. Then differences arise with how energy
will be distributed within the overall upper trough crossing the
eastern half of the country, and thus with surface evolution. Thus
far ECMWF runs have been either sufficiently phased or diffuse
aloft to yield a fairly consistent moderate surface development
that eventually becomes deeper over or near the Canadian
Maritimes. GFS runs have been quite variable, tending to show
stronger development over the northeastern quadrant of lower 48
but also somewhat more flow separation that would support a
trailing wave (the latter hinted at more in the new 12Z ECMWF).
The 12Z GFS has backed off with the depth of primary low pressure
but still has a pronounced trailing wave. A model/mean blend with
the model component tilted somewhat more in the ECMWF direction
provided good continuity while awaiting more confident adjustments
in system evolution. On the other hand, for now the models and
means show better than average agreement relative to typical days
6-7 forecasts for the upper troughing and corresponding storm
system off the Pacific Northwest coast by Sunday-Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A wavy cold front over the East on Thursday will allow for some
lingering showers across mainly the Southeast, along with light
precipitation over parts of the Northeast (snow in northern New
England). By Friday night through the weekend developing low
pressure and associated fronts will spread a broad area of
precipitation across parts of the Plains and especially the East.
Best potential for moderate to locally heavy rainfall will be
ahead of the cold front, approximately from the south-central
Mississippi Valley through the Lower Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley
and into the Southern Appalachians. Expect some wintry weather in
the northern side of the precipitation shield--from parts of the
northern/central Plains through the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. Strength and track of low pressure as well as any
frontal waves will determine the precise details of placement and
totals.

Another round of heavy mountain snow is possible for portions of
the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday ahead of a
shortwave reaching the Northwest by early Friday. Farther south,
the upper trough/possible closed low off southern California will
direct increased moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Four
Corners region through Friday or Saturday. Snow is likely in the
higher terrain, especially over the Colorado Rockies with the
merging of northern and southern stream upper systems. Flow ahead
of the next frontal system approaching the Pacific Northwest
should bring yet another round of heavy mountain snow to the
region by the weekend. Lower elevation rain could become moderate
to heavy from the Pacific Northwest into northwestern California
by early next week.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday particularly for the northern Plains with daytime highs
(and to a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 35 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also likely to be below normal
by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S. through
Sunday. Meanwhile, expect mild to warm weather across the
south-central U.S. and northeastward through Saturday and areas
near the East Coast into Sunday. Many places from the southern
half of the Plains to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25
degrees above normal through Saturday. More daily record high
minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. A potential pattern
shift may finally bring values back closer to normal, possibly
below average in the south-central U.S. by Sunday and the East by
next Monday. Also by Monday parts of the High Plains may see
temperatures rebound to moderately above normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0101 PM CST Mon Dec 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

Tomorrow's forecast of elevated to near critical fire weather
conditions across a broad area of the southern/central High Plains
remains on track. The most likely areas for near critical fire
weather conditions remain along and north of the I-20 corridor
across west Texas and also across portions of western Oklahoma to
western North Texas -- where the most favorable overlap of wind/rh
is expected. While a Critical fire weather area could be needed
across one/both of these areas in a future update, uncertainty
regarding the extent and the duration of critical conditions is too
large to upgrade at this time.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 12/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Mon Dec 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave, currently noted in water-vapor imagery off
the West Coast, is forecast to propagate through the southwesterly
mean flow over the Rockies early Tuesday morning. As this occurs, a
surface low is expected to deepen over the central Plains and
tighten the regional pressure gradient. The net result will be
increasing west/southwesterly winds between 15-20 mph across the
central/southern High Plains into the southern Plains Tuesday.
Antecedent dry fuels and minimal moisture return will support
another day of elevated, to potentially critical, fire weather
concerns.

...Southern/Central High Plains...
Guidance over the past 24 hours has trended towards an earlier
passage of the main synoptic disturbance and places the strongest
boundary-layer flow over the MS River Valley by the afternoon hours.
Despite this displacement of the strongest flow, mostly clear to
partly cloudy skies should yield sufficient mixing to support
frequent gusts between 25-35 mph. With RH values in the 15-25%
range, elevated conditions appear likely. Critical conditions are
possible, but will most likely occur under any axes of stronger
850-700 mb flow. While confidence in the placement of such axes is
low, deterministic solutions, backed by some ensemble guidance,
suggest the most likely corridor for critical conditions lies along
and north of the I-20 corridor across west TX. A Critical risk area
may be introduce in subsequent outlooks if confidence in this
corridor increases.

...Kansas...
A southward-moving cold front is expected to push across KS through
the day Tuesday. Elevated fire weather conditions are likely ahead
of this front, but the duration of the threat will be determined by
the timing of the frontal passage. Uncertainty in the longevity of
fire weather conditions increases with northward extent, and
refinement of the current risk area is possible. Regardless, the
northerly wind shift, coupled with dry post-frontal air, may impact
any ongoing fire suppression efforts.

the Midwest and Southeast beginning Tuesday...

...Warm air expands into Northeast, while cold spreads into Upper
Midwest; elevated fire weather risk for parts of the
Central/Southern Plains...

...Heavy snow for parts of the Central/Southern Rockies...

A seemingly anchored upper level pattern, with persistent
troughing in the west and ridging in the Southeast will lead to
more predictable weather across the CONUS over the next few days.
In the west, a low pressure system will bring snow to portions of
the Intermountain West and Southern/Central Rockies beginning
tonight. Generally 12-18 inches are expected, while the highest
peaks may accumulate over 2 feet of snow by Wednesday evening. The
Sierra will receive some snow while the rest of the state contends
with light to moderate rainfall. The heaviest rain will fall over
southern California tonight through Wednesday. To the north of the
precip, a cold airmass which has situated itself over the Northern
Plains/Rockies and Intermountain West will gradually retract and
expand across the Northwest. High temperatures over parts of
eastern Montana and northwestern North Dakota are forecast to peak
around 10-15 degrees below zero on Tuesday and Wednesday, while
lows will be in the -20s both nights.

As warm air spreads from the Southern Plains into the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast over the next few days, so will the chance for
unsettled weather. Surface low pressure systems will ride along a
pair of shortwaves ejecting from the Rockies and go on to produce
light to moderate snowfall for parts of the Upper Midwest/Great
Lakes and rain showers and thunderstorms for much of the Midwest,
Mid-Atlantic and Southeast starting tomorrow. Intense
thunderstorms and a quasi-stationary front may lead to flash
flooding threats, particularly over areas that receive the most
influx of moisture from the Gulf of Mexico, i.e. parts of the
Midwest, Middle Mississippi Valley and Southern Appalachians. The
anomalously warm air mass generated by an upper-ridge over the
Southeast will lead to the potential for widespread high
temperature records to be broken across the Southern Plains, Lower
Mississippi Valley and eventually Tennessee Valley over the next
couple of days. Warm and dry conditions beneath a strengthening
low pressure system that will enhance winds may lead to the threat
of fire weather across portions of the Southern/Central Plains
through Wednesday.

300 PM EST December 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: During week-2, there is increased confidence that anomalous cold
will
persist or expand over portions of the western and central contiguous U.S. =
and
southeastern Alaska, associated with mid-level low pressure forecast over
western North America. This feature also favors increased chances for heavy
precipitation (coastal rain and high elevation snow) across portions of the
Pacific Northwest, Great Basin, and California during the early and middle
parts of the period. There are differences in the models regarding the
strength
of mid-level high pressure forecast over the southeastern contiguous U.S.,
which will play a role in determining the exact southward and eastward exte=
nt
of the anomalous cold later in week-2.

HAZARDS

High risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern Plain=
s,
Tue-Fri, Jan 4-7.

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northern
Rockies, Northern Plains, and Upper Mississippi Valley, Tue-Sat, Jan 4-8.

FOR TUESDAY JANUARY 04 - MONDAY JANUARY 10: Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BDs model solutions from the
ECMWF and GEFS ensemble indicate a more progressive 500-hPa pattern across
North America during week-2 compared to the recent period of persistent
troughing in the western CONUS and anomalous warmth across the central and
eastern CONUS. The trough that is currently located over the West is foreca=
st
to traverse the CONUS during week-1 and lift out over the Northeast at the
onset of week-2. This trough is forecast to bring unsettled weather to
portions
of the eastern CONUS later in week-1, with a brief period of anomalous cold
over the Northeast in its wake. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicat=
e
at
least a 20% chance minimum temperatures will fall below the 15th
climatological
percentile on Jan 4 and 5, justifying a slight risk for much below normal
temperatures over the region. Increased northwesterly winds are possible as
well, but more likely to occur in the week-1 period, and therefore not
included
in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook.



By the beginning of week-2, a new trough is forecast to develop over the
western CONUS with anomalous ridging persisting over the Southeast. The GEF=
S
is
stronger with this ridge compared to the ECMWF ensembles and as a result, t=
he
GEFS would keep much of the anomalous cold confined to portions of the west=
ern
and north-central CONUS. However, the ECMWF solution depicts increased
shortwave troughing across the northern tier, favoring the colder air makin=
g
its way further south and east into parts of the Central Plains, Middle
Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio Valley. The highest confidence for a
significant Arctic outbreak is across the Northern Plains where the GEFS an=
d
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance that minimum
temperatures
fall below the 15th climatological percentile, initially over the Northern
High
Plains, and expanding eastward through North Dakota by the middle of the
period. Unclibarated guidance from the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles depict mini=
mum
temperatures dropping below -20 deg F in some areas, further supporting the
high risk for much below normal temperatures, which is posted from Jan 4 to=
 7.
The moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is posted through Jan =
8,
and includes much of the Northern Plains and Upper Mississippi Valley, wher=
e
both reforecast tools indicate at least a 40% chance minimum temperatures d=
rop
below the 15th climatological percentile and 0 deg F. The slight risk is va=
lid
for all of week-2 and covers a broader area of the western and central CONU=
S
given the aforementioned uncertainty in the model guidance. The colder ECMW=
F
guidance would support a further south and east expansion of the moderate a=
nd
high risk areas but would like to see more agreement with the GEFS before
doing
so.



The troughing across the West supports above-normal precipitation over the
western third of the CONUS throughout week-2. Both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles
continue to favor surface low formation in the northeastern Pacific resulti=
ng
in enhanced and possibly heavy precipitation along the West Coast. The GEFS
and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitatio=
n
amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 2 inches across parts of the Paci=
fic
Northwest and California, supporting a slight risk of heavy precipitation f=
or
the region from Jan 4 to Jan 8. The ECMWF ensembles favor the heaviest
precipitation to be across the Pacific Northwest, while the GEFS is more
southward focused across California. With anomalously cold air favored to b=
e
in
place, the predicted increase in moisture also supports a slight risk of he=
avy
snow over the Cascades, Sierra Nevadas, and Northern Great Basin from Jan 4=
 to
Jan 8. Although the last several runs of the deterministic GFS and its
ensembles are particularly robust with snow totals across the northern Sier=
ra
Nevadas, the weaker precipitation signal in the ECMWF over this region
precludes a moderate risk from being designated. Additionally, periods of
strong surface pressure gradients are indicated by both the GEFS and ECMWF
ensembles during the early and middle portion of week-2, and reforecast too=
ls
depict a broad region with at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding t=
he
85th percentile and 25-mph across the western CONUS into the High Plains
supporting a slight risk of high wind speeds from Jan 4 to 8 over these are=
as.
By the end of week-2, the ECMWF ensemble indicates weak ridging beginning t=
o
develop near the West Coast of the CONUS, which would result in decreasing
precipitation chances. However, the GEFS is not as quick to move the trough
out
of the region, leading to some increased uncertainty in whether or not heav=
y
precipitation will persist across the region until the end of the period.



Across Alaska, northerly mid-level flow on the backside of the trough axis
forecast over western North America favors below normal temperatures over m=
uch
of Alaska at the onset of week-2. Ridging building over the Bering Sea and
western Mainland Alaska favors a moderation in temperatures, especially in =
the
GEFS, with the most anomalous cold being favored over the southeastern
Mainland
and the Panhandle, where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate eleva=
ted
probabilities for record low temperatures and negative anomalies potentiall=
y
exceeding -25 deg F. A high risk of much below normal temperatures is poste=
d
for the Alaska Panhandle from Jan 4 to 6 where the reforecast tools depict =
at
least a 60% chance minimum temperatures drop below the lowest 10th
climatological percentile. A moderate risk of much below normal temperature=
s
continues through Jan 8, and a broader slight risk remains designated from =
the
Kenai Peninsula through the Alaska Panhandle for all of week-2.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 02 - 06 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
strong ridging over the Bering Sea is forecast, leading to troughing
downstream
across the Gulf of Alaska to the western CONUS with below normal 500-hPa
heights extending northeastward to the Great Lakes and the Northeast.
Anomalous
ridging is likely farther to the south across the Southern Plains and the
southeastern CONUS associated with above-normal 500-hPa heights.

Below normal temperatures are favored over Alaska due to the influence of
relatively cold surface high pressure over there and parts of western Canad=
a.
Troughing over the western and north-central CONUS favors elevated
probabilities for below-normal temperatures over the western CONUS,
north-central CONUS, Great Lakes and Northeast. Conversely, ridging over th=
e
south-central and southeastern CONUS leads to increased chances of near to
above-normal temperatures from the Southern Plains to the Eastern Seaboard.

Mean offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to below-normal
precipitation across the state of Alaska associated with above-normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of
above-normal precipitation for the western CONUS extending to the northern
Great Plains and Great Lakes. Above-normal precipitation is also favored ov=
er
much of the southeastern CONUS, the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys, and the Mid=
dle
Atlantic sea-board ahead of the forecast troughing with potential storm
systems
developing. Near to below-normal precipitation is favored for the southern =
and
central Plains, and parts of the Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

excellent model agreement on most features, though there is uncertainty in =
how
features in the northeastern CONUS will evolve.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 04 - 10 2022

The Week-2 forecasts are very similar to the 6-10 day period. There is good
model agreement on most features, which are expected to remain in place but
may
deamplify a bit toward the end of the period. Meanwhile, the ridge in the
Bering Sea and the trough over the western CONUS are expected to shift
slightly
eastward, increasing the probability of above-normal temperature over the
Middle Mississippi Valley and near to above-normal precipitation for the
eastern CONUS due to the storm systems passing through.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

A blocky and amplified ridge/upper high anchored over the northern
Pacific through late this week will continue to support western
U.S. upper trough reinforcement and chilly weather. A separate
piece of energy within the larger scale trough should track a
little offshore southern California Thursday-Friday. Expect the
pattern to change after Friday as a new upper ridge builds farther
west, leading to a deepening trough over the Northeast Pacific and
renewed moisture feed into the Northwest U.S. Meanwhile this
pattern shift will kick out the late week western trough that will
ultimately support a widespread area of precipitation across the
eastern half of the country in association with organized low
pressure/fronts. A much weaker wavy frontal system will depart
from the East late this week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The spread among the 00Z/06Z models and ensembles, as well as the
preferred forecast approach and resulting system evolution, are
fairly similar to the previous cycle. An operational blend looks
good early in the period with a gradual increase of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means later in the forecast (reaching 40 percent
total by day 7 Monday) helping to tone down lower-predictability
differences.

Through the period there are various embedded detail uncertainties
within a more agreeable mean evolution. On Thursday-Friday
differences are noticeable with the evolution/timing of the energy
off southern California, with the 12Z GFS/UKMET/CMC all suggesting
the 00Z ECMWF may be too slow and closed as northern stream energy
digs down from the north. The 12Z ECMWF has indeed trended
somewhat faster. Either way the overall pattern returns to fairly
good agreement by Saturday. Then differences arise with how energy
will be distributed within the overall upper trough crossing the
eastern half of the country, and thus with surface evolution. Thus
far ECMWF runs have been either sufficiently phased or diffuse
aloft to yield a fairly consistent moderate surface development
that eventually becomes deeper over or near the Canadian
Maritimes. GFS runs have been quite variable, tending to show
stronger development over the northeastern quadrant of lower 48
but also somewhat more flow separation that would support a
trailing wave (the latter hinted at more in the new 12Z ECMWF).
The 12Z GFS has backed off with the depth of primary low pressure
but still has a pronounced trailing wave. A model/mean blend with
the model component tilted somewhat more in the ECMWF direction
provided good continuity while awaiting more confident adjustments
in system evolution. On the other hand, for now the models and
means show better than average agreement relative to typical days
6-7 forecasts for the upper troughing and corresponding storm
system off the Pacific Northwest coast by Sunday-Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A wavy cold front over the East on Thursday will allow for some
lingering showers across mainly the Southeast, along with light
precipitation over parts of the Northeast (snow in northern New
England). By Friday night through the weekend developing low
pressure and associated fronts will spread a broad area of
precipitation across parts of the Plains and especially the East.
Best potential for moderate to locally heavy rainfall will be
ahead of the cold front, approximately from the south-central
Mississippi Valley through the Lower Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley
and into the Southern Appalachians. Expect some wintry weather in
the northern side of the precipitation shield--from parts of the
northern/central Plains through the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. Strength and track of low pressure as well as any
frontal waves will determine the precise details of placement and
totals.

Another round of heavy mountain snow is possible for portions of
the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday ahead of a
shortwave reaching the Northwest by early Friday. Farther south,
the upper trough/possible closed low off southern California will
direct increased moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Four
Corners region through Friday or Saturday. Snow is likely in the
higher terrain, especially over the Colorado Rockies with the
merging of northern and southern stream upper systems. Flow ahead
of the next frontal system approaching the Pacific Northwest
should bring yet another round of heavy mountain snow to the
region by the weekend. Lower elevation rain could become moderate
to heavy from the Pacific Northwest into northwestern California
by early next week.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday particularly for the northern Plains with daytime highs
(and to a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 35 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also likely to be below normal
by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S. through
Sunday. Meanwhile, expect mild to warm weather across the
south-central U.S. and northeastward through Saturday and areas
near the East Coast into Sunday. Many places from the southern
half of the Plains to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25
degrees above normal through Saturday. More daily record high
minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. A potential pattern
shift may finally bring values back closer to normal, possibly
below average in the south-central U.S. by Sunday and the East by
next Monday. Also by Monday parts of the High Plains may see
temperatures rebound to moderately above normal.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...


...Overview...

A blocky and amplified ridge/upper high anchored over the northern
Pacific through late this week will continue to support western
U.S. upper trough reinforcement and chilly weather. A separate
piece of energy within the larger scale trough should track a
little offshore southern California Thursday-Friday. Expect the
pattern to change after Friday as a new upper ridge builds farther
west, leading to a deepening trough over the Northeast Pacific and
renewed moisture feed into the Northwest U.S. Meanwhile this
pattern shift will kick out the late week western trough that will
ultimately support a widespread area of precipitation across the
eastern half of the country in association with organized low
pressure/fronts. A much weaker wavy frontal system will depart
from the East late this week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The spread among the 00Z/06Z models and ensembles, as well as the
preferred forecast approach and resulting system evolution, are
fairly similar to the previous cycle. An operational blend looks
good early in the period with a gradual increase of the 06Z
GEFS/00Z ECMWF means later in the forecast (reaching 40 percent
total by day 7 Monday) helping to tone down lower-predictability
differences.

Through the period there are various embedded detail uncertainties
within a more agreeable mean evolution. On Thursday-Friday
differences are noticeable with the evolution/timing of the energy
off southern California, with the 12Z GFS/UKMET/CMC all suggesting
the 00Z ECMWF may be too slow and closed as northern stream energy
digs down from the north. The 12Z ECMWF has indeed trended
somewhat faster. Either way the overall pattern returns to fairly
good agreement by Saturday. Then differences arise with how energy
will be distributed within the overall upper trough crossing the
eastern half of the country, and thus with surface evolution. Thus
far ECMWF runs have been either sufficiently phased or diffuse
aloft to yield a fairly consistent moderate surface development
that eventually becomes deeper over or near the Canadian
Maritimes. GFS runs have been quite variable, tending to show
stronger development over the northeastern quadrant of lower 48
but also somewhat more flow separation that would support a
trailing wave (the latter hinted at more in the new 12Z ECMWF).
The 12Z GFS has backed off with the depth of primary low pressure
but still has a pronounced trailing wave. A model/mean blend with
the model component tilted somewhat more in the ECMWF direction
provided good continuity while awaiting more confident adjustments
in system evolution. On the other hand, for now the models and
means show better than average agreement relative to typical days
6-7 forecasts for the upper troughing and corresponding storm
system off the Pacific Northwest coast by Sunday-Monday.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A wavy cold front over the East on Thursday will allow for some
lingering showers across mainly the Southeast, along with light
precipitation over parts of the Northeast (snow in northern New
England). By Friday night through the weekend developing low
pressure and associated fronts will spread a broad area of
precipitation across parts of the Plains and especially the East.
Best potential for moderate to locally heavy rainfall will be
ahead of the cold front, approximately from the south-central
Mississippi Valley through the Lower Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley
and into the Southern Appalachians. Expect some wintry weather in
the northern side of the precipitation shield--from parts of the
northern/central Plains through the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast. Strength and track of low pressure as well as any
frontal waves will determine the precise details of placement and
totals.

Another round of heavy mountain snow is possible for portions of
the Pacific Northwest/northern Rockies on Thursday ahead of a
shortwave reaching the Northwest by early Friday. Farther south,
the upper trough/possible closed low off southern California will
direct increased moisture into the southwestern U.S. and Four
Corners region through Friday or Saturday. Snow is likely in the
higher terrain, especially over the Colorado Rockies with the
merging of northern and southern stream upper systems. Flow ahead
of the next frontal system approaching the Pacific Northwest
should bring yet another round of heavy mountain snow to the
region by the weekend. Lower elevation rain could become moderate
to heavy from the Pacific Northwest into northwestern California
by early next week.

Bitterly cold temperatures should continue through at least
Saturday particularly for the northern Plains with daytime highs
(and to a lesser extent overnight lows) 20 to 35 degrees below
average. Some areas of northern North Dakota and Montana may stay
below 0F even into next weekend, despite temperatures moderating
slightly as the week progresses. The addition of gusty winds could
result in dangerously cold wind chills, especially for northern
parts of the High Plains where wind chill values could dip well
below 0F for many. Temperatures are also likely to be below normal
by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S. through
Sunday. Meanwhile, expect mild to warm weather across the
south-central U.S. and northeastward through Saturday and areas
near the East Coast into Sunday. Many places from the southern
half of the Plains to the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic could be 15-25
degrees above normal through Saturday. More daily record high
minimum and maximum temperatures are likely. A potential pattern
shift may finally bring values back closer to normal, possibly
below average in the south-central U.S. by Sunday and the East by
next Monday. Also by Monday parts of the High Plains may see
temperatures rebound to moderately above normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1241 AM CST Tue Dec 28 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather conditions remain likely today across parts of
the southern High Plains. Early-morning water-vapor imagery reveals
an upper-level shortwave over the Four Corners approaching the
southern Rockies. Ahead of this wave, a lee cyclone over northeast
CO has begun to shift to the southeast amid strong low-level warm
advection and broad-scale ascent associated with the upper
disturbance. Several West Texas Mesonet stations have recently
reported warming temperatures and strengthening west/southwest winds
(up to 30 mph in some locations), likely in response to the
tightening regional pressure gradient and strengthening zonal
mid-level flow. Precipitation noted over west TX in early-morning
radar mosaics is likely falling as virga given 20+ F dewpoint
depressions at the surface, a substantial dry layer in the 00 UTC
AMA sounding, and few reports of rainfall under the radar echoes.
This has resulted in some boundary-layer moistening (indicated by
dewpoint rises over the past few hours), and casts uncertainty into
the RH forecast for this afternoon. However, this activity is not
expected to appreciably moisten fuels to mitigate the fire weather
concern.

These observations align with recent model trends that continue to
suggest an early passage of the synoptic wave and associated wind
maxima. Surface winds will likely be maximized between 12-18 UTC
this morning across west TX into western OK before gradually
diminishing during the afternoon/evening hours. This temporal
displacement of strongest winds with peak diurnal heating will limit
the potential for sustained and widespread critical conditions.
However, areas of elevated conditions remain likely as 15-25 mph
winds (gusting up to 30-40 mph at times) coincide with RH reductions
into the low 20s. Localized/transient critical conditions remain
possible, especially under any lingering axes of stronger mid-level
flow. Latest ensemble guidance continues to highlight along/north of
the I-20 corridor in west TX as well as the TX Panhandle into
western OK as preferential zones of drier/windier conditions. To the
north, the fire weather threat across KS may be limited by the
passage of a cold front during the early afternoon, but current
indications are that a few hours of elevated conditions remain
likely prior to the frontal passage.

...Bitterly cold temperatures to continue Thursday-Saturday across
portions of the Northern Plains...

...Heavy rain across across parts of the Tennessee/Ohio Valley New
Year's Eve/New Year's Day...


...Overview and Guidance...
An amplified ridge will be anchored over the northern Pacific
Ocean through this period, which will continue to support an upper
trough over the western U.S.; this pattern will favor very brisk
temperatures. A separate piece of energy within the larger scale
trough should track a little offshore southern California
Thursday-Friday. The overall pattern will begin to transition by
the weekend as a new ridge builds farther west, leading to a
deepening trough over the Northeast Pacific and renewed moisture
feed into the Northwest U.S. The trough and associated moisture
will track into the central and eastern part of the country. A
much weaker wavy frontal system will depart from the East late
this week.

The latest model guidance continues to have similar patterns and
evolution through the extended therefore choose to take a
multi-model approach; this also helps maintain continuity from the
previous forecast. The WPC blend used the 12Z ECWMF/CMC/UKMET,
12/18Z GFS initially and gradually increased the use of the EC
ensemble means and the GEFS means trough the middle and later
periods.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Lingering showers are expected across parts of the Southeast near
a wavy cold front  along with snow over the Northeast near the
parent low pressure. Scattered to widespread showers and
thunderstorms will move across the Plains towards the eastern U.S.
as a low pressure system and associated fronts develops. A plume
of deep moisture will accompany this system and intensify over the
Tennessee Valley; where conditions will be very favorable for
moderate to heavy rainfall to occur. There will be an elevated
risk for local flooding concerns as this region has had recent
soaking rains to lower local flash flood guidance. Expect some
wintry weather in the northern side of the precipitation
shield--from parts of the Northern/Central Plains through the
Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The intensity and storm
track, along with any waves along the boundary, will determine the
the location and amounts.

Heavy mountain snow will spread across the Pacific Northwest and
Northern Rockies Thursday ahead of an approaching shortwave.
Abundant moisture will be directed onshore southern California
with the upper trough/possible closed low positioned offshore.
Moderate to locally heavy rainfall may be possible in the lower
elevations; with snow spreading across the higher terrain
especially over the Colorado Rockies with the merging of northern
and southern stream upper systems. A third system nearing the
Pacific Northwest will usher in an additional round of heavy
mountain snow by the weekend. Lower elevation rain could become
moderate to heavy from the Pacific Northwest into northwestern
California by early next week.

The frigid airmass over the northern tier should persist through
at least Saturday with the daily readings averaging 20 to 35
degrees below average for the end of the year. A few locations in
far northern North Dakota and Montana may stay below 0 F even into
next weekend, despite temperatures moderating slightly as the week
progresses. Gusty winds will create some dangerous wind chill
values of below 0 F. Temperatures are also likely to be below
normal by about 5-15 degrees across the rest of the western U.S.
through Sunday. Warm and mild weather is expected across the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into Sunday, with daily temperature
readings of 15 to 25 degrees warmer than normal from the Southern
Plains to the Ohio Valley and east into the Mid-Atlantic region.

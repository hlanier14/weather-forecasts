Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1059 AM CST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and no adjustments were made
with this outlook. Elevated to locally Critical fire-weather
conditions are still anticipated across portions of southern
California today, as increasing offshore surface winds of 15-20 mph
with higher gusts overlap critically low RH where fuels are
receptive.

Enhanced midlevel northwesterly flow over portions of the central
High Plains will support locally elevated fire-weather conditions,
especially across southeast WY where surface winds may reach 20 mph
and RH values approach 20%.

For more details, please see the previous discussion below.

..Weinman/Karstens.. 11/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0129 AM CST Mon Nov 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad mid-level ridging over the western United States is forecast
to become suppressed southwestward today as a mid-level shortwave
perturbation quickly moves from the Pacific Northwest into the
central Plains. At the surface, high pressure over the eastern Great
Basin and Rockies is forecast to weaken through this afternoon
before becoming reestablished across the northern Great Basin
tonight.

...Southern California...
Elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are anticipated
through at least midday today across inland areas of southern
California with sustained surface winds near 15-20 mph overlapping
widespread critical minimum RH values and receptive fuels. As has
been the case the past several days, locally critical conditions are
most likely in terrain-favored areas of Ventura and Los Angeles
counties, where enhanced surface winds are expected. Surface winds
are forecast to diminish rather rapidly during the afternoon as the
pressure gradient relaxes, which should temporarily temper
large-scale fire weather concerns. Though, elevated to locally
critical conditions may return during the overnight as the pressure
gradient strengthens amidst poor overnight RH recoveries.

...Georgia/South Carolina/North Carolina...
A few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions are expected
this afternoon across the Southeast as north/northwesterly sustained
surface winds near 10-15 mph occur in conjunction with minimum RH

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
150 PM EST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 02 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 06 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada. This may act to amplify the
Eastern U.S. troughing slightly through the period. This will
include an organized low pressure system tracking across
southeastern Canada through Friday with a trailing front followed
by a weaker low this weekend, leading to rounds of mainly light
precipitation across the Great Lakes and northeastern U.S.  By the
weekend, showers and some storms are likely to develop ahead of a
developing storm system from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z guidance suite continues to show decent synoptic scale
agreement through Friday with an upper ridge over the southwestern
U.S. and a broad trough over the Northeast U.S. The only notable
difference is the 06z/12z GFS continue to be much slower than the
rest of the guidance on Thursday/Day 3 with organized low pressure
across the Great Lakes, but eventually catch up by day 4. As the
flow pattern becomes more quasi-zonal into the weekend, model
spread increases some with respect to the next shortwave trough
entering the northwestern U.S., as well as a weak southern stream
upper low developing over northern Mexico. Enough run-to-run model
variations continues to suggest a below average forecast
confidence for the second half of the period. The CMC continues to
be the most problematic as it becomes out of phase along the West
Coast for days 6-7. At the end of the period, much of the guidance
suggests amplification of the Eastern U.S. trough may lead to low
pressure development near the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic on day 7, and
possibly track northward along the Northeast Coast immediately
following the end of the medium range forecast period (12/6 at
12z). Confidence is low in the specifics for impacts across the
Northeast amidst enough timing and intensity uncertainties in the
individual solutions.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on the deterministic guidance
blend through Friday. Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means eventually getting to a 50/50 blend of ensembles
with the deterministic ECMWF and GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected through Saturday.  Rounds of relatively light
precipitation are forecast for the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast with a progressive storm track over the area.  Amounts
should be most substantial in favored lake effect and possibly
upslope areas, particularly downwind of Lake Ontario into the
Adirondacks.  Then moisture is set to increase across the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley late Friday and into the
weekend, which could lead to showers and thunderstorms becoming
more widespread there and then extending northeastward as the
surface low over the Great Lakes becomes better organized. A
shortwave into the Northwest early next week could bring another
round of moderate to locally heavy rain and mountain snows to
parts of western Washington and Oregon.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for this time of year
across most of the nation through next weekend, with the greatest
positive anomalies expected for the central and northern Plains
where both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees
above average for late in the week.  A few locations may approach
daily maximum and minimum temperature records with these mild
temperatures.  By the weekend, temperatures are currently forecast
to moderate somewhat, but this is subject to change given forecast
uncertainties.  No arctic airmass intrusions are expected during
this forecast period.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST November 29 2021

SYNOPSIS: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models indicate a progressive
mid-level pattern during week-2. A series of mid-level lows are predicted t=
o
traverse the lower 48, supporting surface lows and associated fronts across
the
eastern contiguous U.S. A series of surface lows are anticipated to form
across
the Northern Plains, supporting increased potential for heavy snow across t=
he
Northern Rockies and Northern Great Basin at the beginning of the period.
Surface low pressure is forecast to form across the northeastern Pacific.
Strong onshore flow is most likely to support enhanced precipitation across
the
Pacific Northwest and Northern California from the beginning to middle of
week-2. Mid-level low pressure is expected to dominate Alaska during the
period, potentially increasing chances for much below normal temperatures
across the western Mainland at the beginning of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Northeast, T=
ue,
Dec 7.

Slight risk of high winds for coastal portions of the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast, Tue-Thu, Dec 7-9.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern
Great Basin, Tue-Thu, Dec 7-9.

Slight risk of episodes of heavy precipitation across parts of the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California, Tue-Fri, Dec 7-10.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the western
Mainland Alaska, Tue-Thu, Dec 7-9.

9Rg9wNEnyVF$

FOR TUESDAY DECEMBER 07 - MONDAY DECEMBER 13: A series of mid-level troughs
are
anticipated to move across the CONUS during week-2. As an initial trough mo=
ves
across the northeastern CONUS from the end of week-1 into the beginning of
week-2, some areas across the Northeast could experience lingering much bel=
ow
normal temperatures at the start of the period. The 6Z GFS ensemble mean
solution is more supportive of negative temperature anomalies reaching -10 =
Deg
F than the 12Z GFS ensemble mean, which indicates the anomalous cold moving
off
the Northeast prior to week-2. Despite these model differences, a slight ri=
sk
of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the Northeast, Dec=
 7,
where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and single digit=
s
(Deg F).



A surface low is predicted to form over the Midwest at the start of the per=
iod
as another surface low exits the Northeast. These lows and associated front=
s
may support enhanced winds across parts of the northeastern CONUS. A slight
risk of high winds is posted across coastal portions of the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic, where the reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of wind
speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 25 mph. The 6Z deterministic GFS a=
nd
0Z deterministic ECMWF also indicate the potential for these disturbances t=
o
support episodes of localized heavy snow across parts of the upper Midwest =
and
Great Lakes enhanced by lake-effect snow as the cold air traverses the
relatively warm Great Lakes. However, due to significant model differences
regarding the evolution of these surface lows in addition to the reforecast
tools and uncalibrated daily ensemble means not supporting heavy precipitat=
ion
across this region, a related heavy precipitation hazard is not posted. As =
one
of these fronts move across the eastern third of the CONUS, the reforecast
tools show at least a 20% chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85t=
h
percentile and one inch across parts of the Tennessee Valley and Lower
Mississippi Valley at the beginning of the period. Due to daily significant
differences in the ensemble means of accumulated precipitation totals and t=
he
expectation for a fairly progressive front, a related heavy precipitation
hazard is not issued at this time.



Upstream, there is multi-model agreement in both the ensemble means and rec=
ent
deterministic solutions indicating mid-level troughing across the northeast=
ern
Pacific, supporting enhanced moisture flow to the northeastern CONUS. The G=
FS
and ECMWF ensembles indicate enhanced integrated vapor transport exceeding =
250
kg/m/s from the beginning to middle of week-2 that could support enhanced
precipitation across the Pacific Northwest and northern California. A sligh=
t
risk for episodes of heavy precipitation is highlighted for the Pacific
Northwest and Northern California, Dec 7 to 10. A broad period of time is
highlighted due to significant differences among model solutions regarding =
the
timing of the heaviest precipitation. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools
indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding =
the
85h percentile and one inch (2 inches across inland parts of the Pacific
Northwest). Heavy rainfall is anticipated for lower elevation areas, wherea=
s
higher elevation areas may receive heavy snow.



Ample moisture flow in addition to a series of surface lows forming over th=
e
Northern Plains at the beginning of the period may support heavy upslope sn=
ow
across parts of the Northern Rockies and Northern Great Basin. A slight ris=
k
is
posted for these areas, Dec 7 to 9, where the reforecast tools indicate at
least 20% chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th
percentile and one inch.



Mid-level troughing is predicted to dominate much of Alaska during week-2,
which is anticipated to support below normal temperatures across the state.=
 A
slight risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the
western mainland of Alaska, Dec 7 to 9, where the reforecast tools indicate=
 at
least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 10th
percentile. There is good agreement between the 0Z GEFS and ECMWF ensemble
means indicating daily minimum temperatures reaching 10 Deg F below normal =
in
the highlighted risk area.

Northeast amidst enough timing and intensity uncertainties in the
individual solutions.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on the deterministic guidance
blend through Friday. Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means eventually getting to a 50/50 blend of ensembles
with the deterministic ECMWF and GFS.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively quiet in terms of rainfall or snow
related hazards with not much in the way of heavy precipitation
currently expected through Saturday.  Rounds of relatively light
precipitation are forecast for the Midwest, Great Lakes, and
Northeast with a progressive storm track over the area.  Amounts
should be most substantial in favored lake effect and possibly
upslope areas, particularly downwind of Lake Ontario into the
Adirondacks.  Then moisture is set to increase across the Southern
Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley late Friday and into the
weekend, which could lead to showers and thunderstorms becoming
more widespread there and then extending northeastward as the
surface low over the Great Lakes becomes better organized. A
shortwave into the Northwest early next week could bring another
round of moderate to locally heavy rain and mountain snows to
parts of western Washington and Oregon.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for this time of year
across most of the nation through next weekend, with the greatest
positive anomalies expected for the central and northern Plains
where both highs and lows are forecast to be 15 to 25+ degrees
above average for late in the week.  A few locations may approach
daily maximum and minimum temperature records with these mild
temperatures.  By the weekend, temperatures are currently forecast
to moderate somewhat, but this is subject to change given forecast
uncertainties.  No arctic airmass intrusions are expected during
this forecast period.

252 PM EST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Dec 02 2021 - 12Z Mon Dec 06 2021

...Overview...

The overall pattern will be featured by an upper-level ridge from
the eastern Pacific to the Intermountain West, and quasi-zonal
flow to low amplitude troughing from the Plains to the East Coast
with multiple shortwave perturbations pivoting around a synoptic
scale trough over southeast Canada. This may act to amplify the
Eastern U.S. troughing slightly through the period. This will
include an organized low pressure system tracking across
southeastern Canada through Friday with a trailing front followed
by a weaker low this weekend, leading to rounds of mainly light
precipitation across the Great Lakes and northeastern U.S.  By the
weekend, showers and some storms are likely to develop ahead of a
developing storm system from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z/06Z guidance suite continues to show decent synoptic scale
agreement through Friday with an upper ridge over the southwestern
U.S. and a broad trough over the Northeast U.S. The only notable
difference is the 06z/12z GFS continue to be much slower than the
rest of the guidance on Thursday/Day 3 with organized low pressure
across the Great Lakes, but eventually catch up by day 4. As the
flow pattern becomes more quasi-zonal into the weekend, model
spread increases some with respect to the next shortwave trough
entering the northwestern U.S., as well as a weak southern stream
upper low developing over northern Mexico. Enough run-to-run model
variations continues to suggest a below average forecast
confidence for the second half of the period. The CMC continues to
be the most problematic as it becomes out of phase along the West
Coast for days 6-7. At the end of the period, much of the guidance
suggests amplification of the Eastern U.S. trough may lead to low
pressure development near the Southeast/Mid-Atlantic on day 7, and
possibly track northward along the Northeast Coast immediately
following the end of the medium range forecast period (12/6 at
12z). Confidence is low in the specifics for impacts across the
Northeast amidst enough timing and intensity uncertainties in the
individual solutions.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on the deterministic guidance
blend through Friday. Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means eventually getting to a 50/50 blend of ensembles

...Light to moderate rain showers to return over portions of the
Pacific Northwest on Tuesday into Wednesday morning...

...Light snow over the Great Lakes into New England; lake effect
snow returns downwind from Lake Ontario on Tuesday...

...Temperatures will be 15 to 20 degrees above average over parts
of the Northern Rockies and Plains; Elevated Fire Weather Risk for
southern California...

Weak onshore flow off the Pacific will aid in producing light rain
over parts of the Northwest Coast through Tuesday morning when a
plume of moisture returns to the Northwest ending on Wednesday
morning. When the moisture plume returns on Tuesday, light to
moderate rain showers will return to the region. Therefore, the
WPC has issued a Marginal Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Pacific Northwest on Tuesday into Wednesday morning.  The
associated heavy rain will create localized areas of flash
flooding, affecting areas that experience rapid runoff with heavy
rain.

Meanwhile, low pressure moves across the Great Lakes overnight
Monday into Tuesday.  The system will produce light snow over
parts of the Upper Great Lakes tonight that moves to the Lower
Great Lakes by Tuesday.  At this time, lake effect snow develops
downwind from Lake Ontario. The light snow continues over the
Lower Great Lakes into the Northeast through early Wednesday
morning when the snow stops for a short time.  Another area of low
pressure moves into the Great Lakes on Wednesday.

On Tuesday evening, the system produces light snow and rain over
parts of the Northern Plains that moves into the Upper Mississippi
Valley/Upper Great Lakes on Wednesday morning. On Wednesday, rain
develops over parts of the Ohio Valley and expands into parts of
the Mid-Atlantic by Wednesday evening. Furthermore, upper-level
ridging over the western quarter of the country will allow
temperatures to be 15 to 20 degrees above average over parts of
the Northern Rockies and Plains.  Additionally, dry fuels and
offshore gusty wind will aid in producing an Elevated risk of fire
weather over parts of Southern California through Wednesday
morning.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 PM CST Mon Nov 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

The previous forecast remains on track, and no adjustments were made
with this outlook. Elevated fire-weather conditions are expected to
continue into Day 2/Tuesday across portions of southern California,
as the offshore pressure gradient gradually strengthens amid
critically low RH. Latest high-resolution model guidance suggests
that brief locally Critical conditions will also be possible across
terrain-favored areas, though confidence in timing/coverage of these
conditions is currently low.

Across portions of the central and southern High Plains, enhanced
northwesterly midlevel flow and associated downslope warming/drying
will support locally elevated fire-weather conditions during the
afternoon, though there is some uncertainty in where the best
overlap of strong winds and critically low RH will occur.

Across portions of the Southeast, low RH and modest surface winds
may result in locally elevated fire-weather conditions, though a
lack of stronger sustained surface winds will generally limit the
wildfire-spread threat, precluding fire-weather highlights at this
time.

..Weinman/Karstens.. 11/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CST Mon Nov 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
Mid/upper-level ridging is forecast to gradually rebuild across the
western United States Day 2/Tuesday as an area of surface high
pressure over the northern Great Basin strengthens while building
southward.

...Southern California...
At least locally elevated fire weather conditions are likely to
continue into Day 2/Tuesday morning as poor overnight RH recoveries
occur in conjunction with strengthening surface winds. Thereafter,
elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions are anticipated
throughout the day as critical RH values develop amidst sustained
surface winds of 15-20 mph. Near critical fire weather conditions
are possible overnight Day 2/Tuesday into Day 3/Wednesday as the
pressure gradient strengthens and RH recoveries remain poor.
Locations most likely to experience critical conditions include the
wind-prone areas of Ventura and Los Angeles counties where
strong/gusty winds are expected by late in the period. At this time,
confidence in critical criteria being met prior to Day 3/Wednesday
is too low for a Critical upgrade.

...Southeast...
The combination of a dry airmass (e.g., near critical minimum RH
values), modestly breezy afternoon surface winds (e.g., 10-15 mph),
and receptive fuels will likely promote several hours of at least
locally elevated fire weather conditions from late morning through
the afternoon.

300 PM EST Mon November 29 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 05 - 09 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean 500-hPa mid-level heig=
ht
fields, strong ridging near the southwestern Aleutians is forecast, leading=
 to
anticipated troughing downstream across Alaska. Anomalous ridging is likely
farther to the south across the western CONUS. Mean troughing is predicted
along the Eastern Seaboard with below normal 500-hPa heights over the
northeastern CONUS.

Troughing forecast over Alaska leads to increased chances of below normal
temperatures across much of the state. Ridging over the western CONUS in th=
e
period favors above normal temperatures from the West Coast eastward across
most of the central CONUS to parts of the Southeast. Conversely, troughing
over
the northeastern CONUS leads to increased chances of below normal temperatu=
res
over parts of the Northeast.

The potential for enhanced Pacific flow increases chances of above-normal
precipitation over much of the northwestern CONUS and parts of the Northern
Plains. Ridging and surface high pressure are expected across much of the
western and central CONUS in the period , favoring below normal precipitati=
on
over parts of the southwestern CONUS along with the Central and Southern
Plains. Near to above normal precipitation is favored over most of the east=
ern
CONUS ahead of the forecast troughing. Above normal precipitation is also
favored for southern Alaska related to a mean surface low pressure predicte=
d
over the Gulf of Alaska. Offshore flow to the northwest of this low leads t=
o
increased chances of below normal precipitation across northern Mainland
Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 2=
0%
of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
a good agreement on a predicted amplified 500-hPa flow pattern early in the
period, offset by increased uncertainty later in the period associated.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR DEC 07 - 13 2021

In the week-2 period, agreement is fairly good among the models with a trou=
gh
predicted across Alaska. Models are in agreement on a general de-amplificat=
ion
of the overall pattern across much of the CONUS for the period. Troughing o=
ver
Alaska is expected to persist and then push northeastward by the end of
week-2.

Increased chances of below normal temperatures are forecast to persist into
week-2 for most of Alaska. Forecast near to above normal 500-hPa heights le=
ad
to increased chances of above-normal temperatures across much of the CONUS
with
the highest probability over the Southwest and Southern Plains, also
consistent
with the consolidation forecast tool.

Above normal precipitation is favored across the northwestern CONUS eastwar=
d
to
parts of the Northern Rockies due to enhanced Pacific flow predicted across
much of the Northwest Coast. Below normal precipitation is favored in parts=
 of
the southwestern CONUS eastward to the Central and Southern Great Plains du=
e
primarily to the forecast ridging. Above normal precipitation is slightly
favored over the Ohio Valley and Northeast due to forecast frontal passages=
.
Below normal precipitation is favored for northern Mainland Alaska consiste=
nt
with the consolidation forecast tool. Probabilities of above normal
precipitation are slightly elevated for parts of southern Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle in association with the troughing over the Gulf of
Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
December 16.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 AM CST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 301200Z - 011200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad northwest flow will persist aloft over much of the CONUS
through the forecast period. A weak cutoff low off over Baja CA will
continue to meander along the coast and maintain northeasterly flow
off the southern CA coast. This will support another day of fire
weather concerns within the coastal mountains. Elsewhere, localized
fire weather concerns are possible for parts of the southern High
Plains while dry conditions persist across the Southeast.

...Coastal Southern California...
Early morning surface observations show relatively poor overnight
relative humidity recovery with RH values in the teens and low 20s
for many mountainous locations. Continued downslope flow through the
day and daytime heating will foster RH reductions into the low teens
by this afternoon. A modest offshore pressure gradient should
support elevated to locally critical fire weather conditions as
winds gust to 15-30 mph within the coastal mountains (and possibly
up to 40 mph for more wind-prone locations).

...Central and Southern High Plains...
A weak cold front draped from the Great Lakes into the central
Plains will continue to push south through the day. Breezy
post-frontal winds will likely reach 15 to 20 mph across eastern NM
and adjacent areas of western TX. Drier air will filter into the
region, but dewpoints in the low 20s (noted in upstream
observations) will remain within the seasonal range. Combined with
weak cold advection, RH reductions into the 20-35% range are
expected. Localized elevated conditions are possible given dry fine
fuels, but confidence in the duration and coverage of the fire
weather threat remains too low for highlights.

...Southeast...
Dry conditions are expected again today with RH reductions to near
30%, and perhaps as low as 25%, from southern GA into the Carolinas.
Although fuels are somewhat dry, weak surface flow over the region
and poor alignment of low-level and stronger mid-level winds will
limit the potential fire weather concerns.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
156 AM EST Tue Nov 30 2021

Valid 12Z Fri Dec 3 2021 - 12Z Tue Dec 7 2021

...Overview...

A quasi-zonal flow pattern is expected to be in place to close out
the work week across the northern tier states with a pronounced
trough exiting the East Coast.  By the weekend, an upper ridge
axis tries to become established over the West Coast and the
eastern Pacific, and a trough amplifies with developing surface
low over the Plains.  This will likely be followed by a second
well organized storm system by the end of the forecast period
across the western High Plains, with a zonal flow pattern across
the eastern half of the nation.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite is in decent agreement on Friday
before more noticeable differences emerge by Saturday, with the
GFS indicating a flatter trough over the Great Lakes and
Northeast, and the ensemble means are not capturing the magnitude
of the incoming trough across the Pacific Northwest that will
eventually lead to an organized low pressure system over the
Plains by Sunday morning.  The CMC has trended more in line with
the model consensus compared to previous days across the western
U.S., and is reasonably close to the GFS and ECMWF with portraying
the next trough/storm system arriving on the West Coast by Monday
night.  By the end of the forecast period, the GFS is considerably
stronger and slower with the trough approaching the East Coast.

The WPC forecast was primarily based on a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend
through Saturday.  Thereafter, increased weighting towards the
ensemble means whilst keeping some of the operational GFS and
ECMWF.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Weather should be relatively uneventful in terms of rainfall or
snow related hazards with not much in the way of heavy
precipitation currently expected through early Sunday.  Rounds of
relatively light precipitation are forecast for the Midwest, Great
Lakes, and Northeast with a progressive storm track over the
region.  Moisture increasing ahead of a cold front is expected to
result in scattered showers and a few thunderstorms from the Deep
South to the Ohio Valley over the weekend, but amounts are not
currently expected to be excessive.  A shortwave and cold front
reaching the Pacific Northwest by Sunday night and through Monday
is expected to result in another round of moderate to locally
heavy rain and mountain snows to western Washington and Oregon,
with some of this moisture reaching the northern Rockies by
Tuesday with heavy snow possible for the higher elevations of
northern Idaho, western Montana, and western Wyoming.

Temperatures are expected to be above normal for early December
across most of the nation through early next week, with the
greatest positive anomalies expected for the central and southern
Plains on Friday where highs are forecast to be 15 to 25 degrees
above average.  Another episode of well above normal temperatures
is likely for the western High Plains on Monday ahead of the next
cold front.  A few locations may approach daily record highs with
these mild temperatures.  On the other end of the spectrum, cold
weather is forecast to continue across the Northeast U.S. with
highs running up to 10 degrees below normal through the weekend
with a cold upper level trough overhead.  However, no major arctic
airmass intrusions are expected during this forecast period.

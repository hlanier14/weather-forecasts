Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1122 AM CDT Wed Oct 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO INTO
THE NORTHWEST TEXAS PANHANDLE...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF DEEP SOUTH TEXAS...

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments for
the latest guidance. The eastern edge of the Elevated area across
far south Texas was trimmed westward as moderate overnight
precipitation should limit the threat for fire weather conditions
through the evening. The critical area over the Texas Panhandle and
northeastern New Mexico was adjusted slightly westward for the
latest hi-res guidance. Elsewhere, the forecast remains unchanged.
See the prior discussion for additional information.

..Lyons.. 10/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0135 AM CDT Wed Oct 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough and associated surface low will progress towards the
southern Mississippi Valley, with deep-layer dry northwesterly flow
prevailing across the Southern Plains today. Strong northwesterly
surface winds will support favorable conditions for grass-fire
spread to areas that have not experienced heavy rainfall
accumulations yesterday. Specifically, fire weather highlights have
been removed across portions of the Texas Rolling Plains/Big Country
given the passage of a mature squall line over fuels that were
modestly receptive at best. However, areas farther west (i.e. far
eastern New Mexico) and southward into Deep South Texas have
remained relatively devoid of precipitation accumulations.

Widespread 15-25 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds amid RH
under 20% are expected by afternoon peak heating across far eastern
New Mexico into Deep South Texas, where Elevated highlights have
been maintained. A focused corridor of potentially overlapping 20+
mph sustained northwesterly surface winds and 15% RH is likely along
the New Mexico/Texas Panhandle border area, prompting the
continuation of Critical highlights. Similarly, the Critical area
remains in place across Deep South Texas, where 20+ mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds and 15% RH are still expected.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Northeast on Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The start of the medium range period on Saturday will feature a
deep cyclone tracking northeastward from the central Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic, likely accompanied by active weather especially
within the tight gradient to the north of the system. Model
guidance has maintained reasonably good agreement and continuity
over the past few days and once again a consensus model blend
provides a good starting point.

Behind this system, model and ensemble guidance generally expects
the large scale upper pattern to evolve toward a strong western
Canada ridge while downstream troughing drifts from central into
eastern Canada and extends into portions of the central/eastern
U.S. Meanwhile a compact upper low should reach near the
central/north-central West Coast by the start of Saturday followed
by upstream Pacific energy approaching by Monday. Guidance is
still having difficulty in resolving the ultimate fate of the
initial upper low (split between getting stuck/shearing over
Oregon versus continuing east-southeast; new 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
side with the former) as well as what proportion of next week's
Pacific energy will filter through a general mean ridge that most
guidance develops over the West Coast/Interior West from late
weekend through at least the first half of next week. In addition,
issues with the eastern Pacific into western North America flow
have a meaningful influence on the orientation of the
central/eastern U.S. trough.

In terms of larger-scale considerations involving 00Z/06Z
guidance, the 06Z GFS and eventually the 00Z CMC provided the
least appealing solutions. From early in the period the 06Z GFS
showed more southwestward amplitude versus consensus for the upper
trough crossing the northern tier U.S., ultimately leading to a
more southern track of the upper low in Canada and slower
progression for the cold front crossing the central U.S. The 06Z
GEFS mean offered some support but the new 12Z GFS/GEFS adjusted
back toward the majority scenario. Then later in the period the
06Z GFS was quick to erode the western Canada ridge and thus
pushed the upper trough farther into the eastern U.S. than
consensus. Meanwhile the 00Z CMC brought a fairly slow moving
upper low into the West by next Tuesday-Wednesday--in contrast to
other guidance and teleconnection relations relative to the core
of positive height anomalies over north-central Canada. ECMWF runs
have been bringing some energy into the West but are at least
progressive enough to maintain the theme of mean ridging. The new
12Z CMC compares much better to guidance than the prior run.

Downstream, recent GFS/ECMWF model runs as well as the full
ensemble spread do not inspire confidence in the shape/orientation
of the overall central-eastern U.S. trough, and likewise for the
ultimate eastward/southward extent of the leading surface front.
Latest trends appear to favor somewhat more of a positive tilt for
the trough, thus pulling back the surface front somewhat by the
middle of next week. Teleconnections appear to suggest fairly high
sensitivity to the exact location of the positive height anomaly
center over Canada, favoring a conservative approach to the
forecast.

Forecast considerations and guidance comparisons led to starting
with a blend of the 00Z operational models for about the first
half of the period followed by a trend toward the 00Z GFS/ECMWF,
06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means, and some WPC continuity to provide an
intermediate adjustment between previous forecast latest guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy rains from the Eastern U.S. cyclone will be continuing
across portions of New England, fueled by a sustained Atlantic
moisture feed ahead of the front anchored by the surface low. This
likely will bring some degree of a flood/runoff threat to parts of
eastern New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday.

The front moving through the Northwest on Saturday may bring some
light rain/mountain snows to parts of the Great Basin/northern
Rockies, expanding into parts of the north-central Plains by
Sunday. Some snow may be possible during the colder overnight
hours even at the lower elevations of the High Plains. Confidence
in the precise coverage and intensity of precipitation across
these regions remains low, based on the uncertainty of important
details of flow aloft. Locations from the southern Plains into the
Midwest/Ohio Valley and eventually the interior northeast should
see expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy
front early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but there is a developing signal for some heavier
totals over or near the southern Plains by next Tuesday or
Wednesday. Pacific shortwave energy and moisture may bring one or
more episodes of precipitation to central/northern parts of the
West Coast Monday-Wednesday, still with fairly modest confidence
in the details at this time.

The Southeast will start the weekend with some highs 10-15F below
normal. Expect temperatures over the region to trend closer to
normal for the rest of the period as the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
system lifts away. The southern half of the High Plains will start
warm (highs 10-15F above normal) on Saturday, but then an
expanding area of below normal readings will settle over the
central U.S. for multiple days. The chilly air should reach
Montana on Saturday and then push into the central Plains and
Midwest from late weekend through the first half of next week.
Areas from the northern High Plains through the south-central
Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi Valley/Ohio Valley
should see one or more days with highs 5-15F below climatological
values for this time of year. Anomalies for min temperatures
should be less extreme but could still be noteworthy for producing
the first freeze in some areas from the central Plains into the
Midwest around next Tuesday.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Northeast on Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The start of the medium range period on Saturday will feature a
deep cyclone tracking northeastward from the central Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic, likely accompanied by active weather especially
within the tight gradient to the north of the system. Model
guidance has maintained reasonably good agreement and continuity
over the past few days and once again a consensus model blend
provides a good starting point.

Behind this system, model and ensemble guidance generally expects
the large scale upper pattern to evolve toward a strong western
Canada ridge while downstream troughing drifts from central into
eastern Canada and extends into portions of the central/eastern
U.S. Meanwhile a compact upper low should reach near the
central/north-central West Coast by the start of Saturday followed
by upstream Pacific energy approaching by Monday. Guidance is
still having difficulty in resolving the ultimate fate of the
initial upper low (split between getting stuck/shearing over
Oregon versus continuing east-southeast; new 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
side with the former) as well as what proportion of next week's
Pacific energy will filter through a general mean ridge that most
guidance develops over the West Coast/Interior West from late
weekend through at least the first half of next week. In addition,
issues with the eastern Pacific into western North America flow
have a meaningful influence on the orientation of the
central/eastern U.S. trough.

In terms of larger-scale considerations involving 00Z/06Z
guidance, the 06Z GFS and eventually the 00Z CMC provided the
least appealing solutions. From early in the period the 06Z GFS
showed more southwestward amplitude versus consensus for the upper
trough crossing the northern tier U.S., ultimately leading to a
more southern track of the upper low in Canada and slower
progression for the cold front crossing the central U.S. The 06Z
GEFS mean offered some support but the new 12Z GFS/GEFS adjusted
back toward the majority scenario. Then later in the period the
06Z GFS was quick to erode the western Canada ridge and thus
pushed the upper trough farther into the eastern U.S. than
consensus. Meanwhile the 00Z CMC brought a fairly slow moving
upper low into the West by next Tuesday-Wednesday--in contrast to
other guidance and teleconnection relations relative to the core
of positive height anomalies over north-central Canada. ECMWF runs
have been bringing some energy into the West but are at least
progressive enough to maintain the theme of mean ridging. The new
12Z CMC compares much better to guidance than the prior run.

Downstream, recent GFS/ECMWF model runs as well as the full
ensemble spread do not inspire confidence in the shape/orientation
of the overall central-eastern U.S. trough, and likewise for the
ultimate eastward/southward extent of the leading surface front.
Latest trends appear to favor somewhat more of a positive tilt for
the trough, thus pulling back the surface front somewhat by the
middle of next week. Teleconnections appear to suggest fairly high
sensitivity to the exact location of the positive height anomaly
center over Canada, favoring a conservative approach to the
forecast.

Forecast considerations and guidance comparisons led to starting
with a blend of the 00Z operational models for about the first
half of the period followed by a trend toward the 00Z GFS/ECMWF,
06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means, and some WPC continuity to provide an
intermediate adjustment between previous forecast latest guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy rains from the Eastern U.S. cyclone will be continuing
across portions of New England, fueled by a sustained Atlantic
moisture feed ahead of the front anchored by the surface low. This
likely will bring some degree of a flood/runoff threat to parts of
eastern New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday.

The front moving through the Northwest on Saturday may bring some
light rain/mountain snows to parts of the Great Basin/northern

FOR THURSDAY NOVEMBER 04 - WEDNESDAY NOVEMBER 10: The coldest temperatures =
so
far this fall season are likely across the central U.S. at the beginning of
November, with the anomalous cold expected to overspread the eastern U.S.
later
next week. The ECMWF reforecast tool remains the most bullish with
probabilities exceeding 60 percent that minimum temperatures fall into the
lowest 15th percentile over the Great Plains and Corn Belt from Nov 4 to 6.
Since the GEFS reforecast tool has much lower probabilities, only a moderat=
e
risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for areas of the central a=
nd
eastern U.S. where a freeze is probable and minimum temperatures have at le=
ast
a 40 percent chance of falling into the lowest 15th percentile. The souther=
n
Great Plains along with the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys have yet to experien=
ce
a
freeze, but the end of the growing season is expected during the first week=
 of
November with this outbreak of anomalous cold. The slight risk for much bel=
ow
normal temperatures extends closer to the Gulf Coast and includes areas whe=
re
temperature tools depict at least a 20 percent chance of minimum temperatur=
es
falling below 40 deg F, elevating the potential for frost. As a 500-hPa tro=
ugh
approaches the West Coast, a moderating trend in temperatures is expected f=
or
the east-central U.S. later in week-2. Due to this evolving longwave patter=
n
upstream and increasing differences between the GEFS and ECMWF temperature
tools, the slight risk of much below normal temperatures is discontinued af=
ter
day 10 (Nov 6).



The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means are in excellent agreement that an amplifi=
ed
500-hPa trough develops over the northeast Pacific with enhanced Pacific fl=
ow
returning to western North America during week-2. Given this excellent
agreement between the GFS and ECMWF ensemble means, guidance from reforecas=
t
precipitation tools, and an increasing chance of an atmospheric river event=
, a
moderate risk of heavy precipitation (more than 2 inches per 24 hours) is
posted for the Pacific Northwest and parts of northern California from Nov =
6
to
8. A slight risk of heavy precipitation covers a larger spatial extent and
continues through Nov 10. Most of the coastal Pacific Northwest and norther=
n
California has received more than 10 inches of liquid equivalent precipitat=
ion
during the past month. Due to the antecedent wetness, additional heavy rain
could trigger flooding. Also, heavy rain may lead to mudslides and debris
flows
in burn scar areas. Based on the likelihood of anomalous troughing, a moder=
ate
risk of heavy snow (more than 12 inches per 24 hours) is posted for the
Cascades from Nov 6 to 8 with a slight risk continuing through Nov 10. Due =
to
more uncertainty on how far south the enhanced onshore flow extends along t=
he
West Coast, only a slight risk of heavy snow is posted for the Sierra Nevad=
a
Mountains from Nov 6 to 10. The amplified 500-hPa trough, as predicted by t=
he
GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means, supports a slight risk of high winds from th=
e
West Coast to the Continental Divide.

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 02 - 06 2021

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs GEFS and ECMWF ensemble model solutions a=
re in good agreement with
the
overall 500-hPa height pattern across the forecast domain during the 6-10 d=
ay
period. Near- to below-normal mid-level heights are predicted over extreme
southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, and above-normal mid-level
heights are forecast over the remainder of the state. Over the Contiguous U=
.S.
(CONUS), 500-hPa heights have generally decreased since yesterday=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day
forecast. Positive height anomalies are reduced over the northwestern CONUS
while negative height anomalies have increased in magnitude and coverage
across
the eastern CONUS, compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model =
solutions, with the GEFS
coming into better agreement with the ECMWF ensemble.

Mean surface low pressure over southwestern Alaska favors southerly flow an=

enhanced odds of above-normal temperatures across much of central and easte=
rn
Alaska. To the west of the surface low pressure, northerly winds increase
probabilities of near- to below-normal temperatures across the western
Mainland
Alaska and the Aleutians. Above-normal temperature probabilities across the
western CONUS are reduced in magnitude relative to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs 6-10 day
forecast, as above-normal heights have retreated farther north into Canada =

today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ensemble model guidance. Meanwhile, model=
s have trended colder
across
much of the eastern CONUS in recent runs, increasing coverage and magnitude=
 of
below-normal temperature probabilities from the eastern Rockies to the
Appalachians. Ahead of the mean trough axis, odds tilt toward above-normal
temperatures in eastern Maine.

Underneath mean southerly surface flow, above-normal precipitation is favor=
ed
across southern Mainland Alaska and the Panhandle. Below-normal precipitati=
on
is weakly favored across northeastern Mainland Alaska, underneath above-nor=
mal
500-hPa heights. Probabilities of above-normal precipitation across the
western
CONUS are enhanced as mean 500-hPa heights have fallen since yesterday=EF=

day forecast, particularly across the northwestern CONUS, allowing for

from the Central and Southern Plains to the East Coast. Near- to above-norm=

500-hPa heights favor increased odds of below-normal precipitation in the

behind the mean trough axis over the eastern CONUS.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=

centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
increased agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs ECMWF and GEFS =
ensemble model solutions,
offset by large differences in the precipitation fields in the eastern CONU=
S.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR NOV 04 - 10 2021

The week-2 500-hPa height pattern depicts a slight eastward progression of =
the
6-10 day mid-level height pattern. Near- to above-normal 500-hPa heights ar=
e
favored over northern Alaska and the extreme western Aleutians, with negati=
ve
mid-level height anomalies favored over southern Alaska, under greater
influence from mean surface low pressure. A mean mid-level trough and
below-normal heights are the most likely outcome for the Northeast Pacific,
extending into the Pacific Northwest, and across the eastern CONUS. The mea=
n
ridge over the western CONUS continues to deamplify in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=
=BD=EF=BF=BDs model
solutions,
with near-normal mid-level heights favored.

The southeastward progression of the mean trough over the Northeast Pacific
increases easterly surface flow to the north across Alaska, leading to
enhanced
near- to below-normal temperature probabilities across northern and western
Alaska. The shift in surface flow is not  likely until later in the week-2
period over eastern Mainland Alaska, hence the weak tilt in the odds toward
above-normal temperatures. Above-normal temperatures are also favored acros=
s
the western CONUS, but reduced in coverage compared to yesterday=EF=BF=BD=
=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs week-2
forecast, as the mean ridge is deamplified. Increased intensity and coverag=
e
of
negative 500-hPa height anomalies in today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs mode=
l solutions favors enhanced
odds of below-normal temperatures across much of the eastern CONUS.

With continued southeastward progression of the mean mid-level trough over =
the
Northeast Pacific, increased easterly flow favors near- to below-normal
precipitation across most of Alaska. Odds tilt toward above-normal
precipitation across the southeastern Alaska Panhandle, where onshore flow =
is
still evident. The eastward progression of this trough also favors enhanced
probabilities of above-normal precipitation across much of the West due to
increased onshore flow. Weak ridging slightly increases chances of below-
normal
precipitation from the Four Corners to the Southern High Plains. Below-norm=
al
precipitation odds are weakly favored across parts of the Great Lakes, just
behind the mean trough axis. There is great uncertainty across the eastern
CONUS with respect to the strength of surface high pressure during week-2.
ECMWF ensemble guidance indicates stronger surface high pressure across muc=
h
of
the East, increasing the potential for drier-than-normal conditions across =
the
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. Conversely, the GEFS depicts weaker me=
an
surface high pressure, allowing for a more northerly-displaced mean frontal
boundary, leading to increased odds for above-normal precipitation across t=
he
Great Plains and Mississippi Valley. In addition, signals were offsetting i=
n
some of the statistical guidance. Due to increased uncertainty in today=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
model
and statistical guidance, near-normal precipitation is favored across much =
of
the eastern CONUS.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 45% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Well below average, 1 out of 5=
,
due to general agreement among the models with respect to the overall heigh=

pattern across the forecast domain, offset by large inconsistencies in the
model temperature and precipitation fields, particularly in the East.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0232 PM CDT Wed Oct 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

Minor adjustments have been made to the elevated area into portions
of north Texas and the southeastern Texas Panhandle where greater
heating and drier surface conditions are expected. While strong
north/northwesterly winds are expected (sustained 20-30 mph) across
much of the southern High Plains, recent precipitation and cooler
temperatures suggest that fuels will be mostly unfavorable. Pockets
of lower RH (17-20%) and rapidly curing grassy fuels may still
support some local fire risk, but confidence remains too low to
introduce critical probabilities. Elsewhere the previous forecast
remains unchanged.

..Lyons.. 10/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0152 AM CDT Wed Oct 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep northwesterly flow regime will persist across the Southern
Plains as an upper trough and surface low slowly progress towards
the Ohio Valley tomorrow/Thursday. Similar to Day 1, Critically dry
and windy conditions will ensue across portions of the Southern
Plains. However, given the passage of heavy rainfall/thunderstorms
previous to Day 1, fuel receptiveness is expected to remain poor
across several locales.

Portions of far western Kansas into the central Texas Panhandle have
not experienced overly heavy rain. Finer fuels are expected to be
receptive enough to support some grass-fire spread, and given 15-25
mph sustained northwesterly winds coinciding with 20% RH, Elevated
highlights have been introduced. Similar to Day 1, 15 mph sustained
northwesterly winds and 20% RH will persist across Deep South Texas,
prompting the introduction of Elevated highlights here as well.

...Anomalous low pressure system to spawn severe weather across
Gulf Coast today followed by the Southeast on Thursday...

...Threat of flooding rains moving into the Mid-Atlantic states on
Friday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest...

As the Nor'easter quickly moves away from the New England states,
another significant low pressure system is quickly developing over
the southern Plains and into the Deep South.  This system is
bringing a swath of moderate to heavy rain that extends through
the mid-section of the country from the Gulf Coast all the way to
the Canadian border.  Severe thunderstorms continue to march
steadily from west to east into the lower Mississippi this
Wednesday afternoon.  The low pressure system is forecast to
deepen while expanding in size as it moves slowly towards the
eastern U.S. during the next couple of days.  Much of the severe
weather threat will continue to progress eastward into the eastern
Gulf states tonight before overspreading the southeastern U.S. on
Thursday, especially northern and central Florida and along the
Southeast U.S. coast.  Meanwhile, a soaking rain is expected to
stretch northward from the low pressure center near the
Arkansas-Missouri border through Minnesota tonight, gradually
expanding eastward into the Ohio Valley on Thursday.

By Friday, an anomalously large low pressure system is forecast to
engulf much of the eastern U.S. while pulling in abundant moisture
from the Atlantic.  It appears that the interior Mid-Atlantic into
the central Appalachians will be under the highest threat of heavy
rain on Friday as deep layer moisture from the Atlantic interacts
with local terrain ahead of the low pressure system approaching
from the southwest.  Additional heavy rainfall is also possible
across the lower Great Lakes while an expansive area of rain
covers much of the Midwest, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and down
into the interior Deep South on Friday.  Some locations in the
lower to mid-Mississippi Valley could see the barometer dipping to
record low levels for the month of October Thursday night as the
center of the anomalous low moves across.  Below average high
temperatures will filter into the Mississippi Valley and then into
the Southeast on the backside of the anomalous low.

An active frontal system with multiple low pressure centers will
bring more wet weather to the Pacific Northwest through Friday.
Heavy snow will impact the peaks of the northern Cascades while
lower elevations receive rain showers over the next couple of
days.  Critical Fire Weather is forecast for parts of the Southern
Plains today and Thursday. Areas untouched by the ongoing rainfall
and severe weather, eastern New Mexico and south Texas, will be
especially susceptible to fire weather due to dry conditions and
high surface wind speeds on the order of 15-25 mph.

...Major storm to focus a heavy rainfall/flood threat for parts of
the Northeast on Saturday...


...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The start of the medium range period on Saturday will feature a
deep cyclone tracking northeastward from the central Appalachians
and Mid-Atlantic, likely accompanied by active weather especially
within the tight gradient to the north of the system. Model
guidance has maintained reasonably good agreement and continuity
over the past few days and once again a consensus model blend
provides a good starting point.

Behind this system, model and ensemble guidance generally expects
the large scale upper pattern to evolve toward a strong western
Canada ridge while downstream troughing drifts from central into
eastern Canada and extends into portions of the central/eastern
U.S. Meanwhile a compact upper low should reach near the
central/north-central West Coast by the start of Saturday followed
by upstream Pacific energy approaching by Monday. Guidance is
still having difficulty in resolving the ultimate fate of the
initial upper low (split between getting stuck/shearing over
Oregon versus continuing east-southeast; new 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
side with the former) as well as what proportion of next week's
Pacific energy will filter through a general mean ridge that most
guidance develops over the West Coast/Interior West from late
weekend through at least the first half of next week. In addition,
issues with the eastern Pacific into western North America flow
have a meaningful influence on the orientation of the
central/eastern U.S. trough.

In terms of larger-scale considerations involving 00Z/06Z
guidance, the 06Z GFS and eventually the 00Z CMC provided the
least appealing solutions. From early in the period the 06Z GFS
showed more southwestward amplitude versus consensus for the upper
trough crossing the northern tier U.S., ultimately leading to a
more southern track of the upper low in Canada and slower
progression for the cold front crossing the central U.S. The 06Z
GEFS mean offered some support but the new 12Z GFS/GEFS adjusted
back toward the majority scenario. Then later in the period the
06Z GFS was quick to erode the western Canada ridge and thus
pushed the upper trough farther into the eastern U.S. than
consensus. Meanwhile the 00Z CMC brought a fairly slow moving
upper low into the West by next Tuesday-Wednesday--in contrast to
other guidance and teleconnection relations relative to the core
of positive height anomalies over north-central Canada. ECMWF runs
have been bringing some energy into the West but are at least
progressive enough to maintain the theme of mean ridging. The new
12Z CMC compares much better to guidance than the prior run.

Downstream, recent GFS/ECMWF model runs as well as the full
ensemble spread do not inspire confidence in the shape/orientation
of the overall central-eastern U.S. trough, and likewise for the
ultimate eastward/southward extent of the leading surface front.
Latest trends appear to favor somewhat more of a positive tilt for
the trough, thus pulling back the surface front somewhat by the
middle of next week. Teleconnections appear to suggest fairly high
sensitivity to the exact location of the positive height anomaly
center over Canada, favoring a conservative approach to the
forecast.

Forecast considerations and guidance comparisons led to starting
with a blend of the 00Z operational models for about the first
half of the period followed by a trend toward the 00Z GFS/ECMWF,
06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means, and some WPC continuity to provide an
intermediate adjustment between previous forecast latest guidance.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy rains from the Eastern U.S. cyclone will be continuing
across portions of New England, fueled by a sustained Atlantic
moisture feed ahead of the front anchored by the surface low. This
likely will bring some degree of a flood/runoff threat to parts of
eastern New Hampshire and Maine on Saturday.

The front moving through the Northwest on Saturday may bring some
light rain/mountain snows to parts of the Great Basin/northern
Rockies, expanding into parts of the north-central Plains by
Sunday. Some snow may be possible during the colder overnight
hours even at the lower elevations of the High Plains. Confidence
in the precise coverage and intensity of precipitation across
these regions remains low, based on the uncertainty of important
details of flow aloft. Locations from the southern Plains into the
Midwest/Ohio Valley and eventually the interior northeast should
see expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy
front early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but there is a developing signal for some heavier
totals over or near the southern Plains by next Tuesday or
Wednesday. Pacific shortwave energy and moisture may bring one or
more episodes of precipitation to central/northern parts of the
West Coast Monday-Wednesday, still with fairly modest confidence
in the details at this time.

The Southeast will start the weekend with some highs 10-15F below
normal. Expect temperatures over the region to trend closer to
normal for the rest of the period as the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast
system lifts away. The southern half of the High Plains will start
warm (highs 10-15F above normal) on Saturday, but then an
expanding area of below normal readings will settle over the
central U.S. for multiple days. The chilly air should reach
Montana on Saturday and then push into the central Plains and
Midwest from late weekend through the first half of next week.
Areas from the northern High Plains through the south-central
Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi Valley/Ohio Valley
should see one or more days with highs 5-15F below climatological
values for this time of year. Anomalies for min temperatures
should be less extreme but could still be noteworthy for producing
the first freeze in some areas from the central Plains into the
Midwest around next Tuesday.

...Anomalous low pressure system to spawn severe weather across
Gulf Coast into tonight followed by the Southeast on Thursday...

...Threat of flooding rains moving into the Mid-Atlantic states on
Friday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest...

As the Nor'easter quickly moves away from the New England states,
another significant low pressure system is quickly developing over
the southern Plains and into the Deep South.  This system is
bringing a swath of moderate to heavy rain that extends through
the mid-section of the country from the Gulf Coast all the way to
the Canadian border.  Severe thunderstorms continue to march
steadily from west to east into the lower Mississippi Valley this
Wednesday afternoon.  The low pressure system is forecast to
deepen while expanding in size as it moves slowly towards the
eastern U.S. during the next couple of days.  Much of the severe
weather threat will continue to progress eastward into the eastern
Gulf states tonight before overspreading the southeastern U.S. on
Thursday, especially northern and central Florida and along the
Southeast U.S. coast.  Meanwhile, a soaking rain is expected to
stretch northward from the low pressure center near the
Arkansas-Missouri border through Minnesota tonight, gradually
expanding eastward into the Ohio Valley on Thursday.

By Friday, an anomalously large low pressure system is forecast to
engulf much of the eastern U.S. while pulling in abundant moisture
from the Atlantic.  It appears that the interior Mid-Atlantic into
the central Appalachians will be under the highest threat of heavy
rain on Friday as deep layer moisture from the Atlantic interacts
with local terrain ahead of the low pressure system approaching
from the southwest.  Additional heavy rainfall is also possible
across the lower Great Lakes while an expansive area of rain
covers much of the Midwest, Ohio and Tennessee Valleys and down
into the interior Deep South on Friday.  Some locations in the
lower to mid-Mississippi Valley could see the barometer dipping to
record low levels for the month of October Thursday night as the
center of the anomalous low moves across.  Below average high
temperatures will filter into the Mississippi Valley and then into
the Southeast on the backside of the anomalous low.

An active frontal system with multiple low pressure centers will
bring more wet weather to the Pacific Northwest through Friday.
Heavy snow will impact the peaks of the northern Cascades while
lower elevations receive rain showers over the next couple of
days.  Critical Fire Weather is forecast for parts of the Southern
Plains into tonight and Thursday.  Areas untouched by the ongoing
rainfall and severe weather, eastern New Mexico and south Texas,
will be especially susceptible to fire weather due to dry
conditions and high surface wind speeds on the order of 15-25 mph.

...Anomalous low pressure system to spawn severe weather across
Southeast today...

...Flash Flooding threat moves into the Mid-Atlantic states on
Friday...

...Wet pattern continues across the Pacific Northwest...

An area of low pressure will deepen as it brings scattered showers
and thunderstorms from the Midwest to the Southeast today before
setting its sights on the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast for Friday.
Some thunderstorms may be severe today for much of Florida and the
Southeast, where line segments capable of producing damaging winds
as well as isolated tornadoes out ahead of the cold front are
possible. A Slight Risk of Severe Thunderstorms is in effect for
these areas today. This occluded system will swing its fronts
north along the East coast on Friday as it spreads moisture across
the Northeast in the form of rain showers. Heavy rain leading to
Flash flooding is a concern for parts of the Mid-Atlantic and
Central Appalachians where between 1-2 inches of rain may fall by
Saturday morning. Temperatures are expected to fall precipitously
across the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley today and then across
the Southeast on Friday in the wake of this anomalous low pressure
system in the east. High temperatures will be between 15-25
degrees below average for these areas over the next two days.

A potent yet brief atmospheric river event is likely to occur over
the Pacific Northwest later today as a low pressure system makes
its way across the region. The heaviest rainfall will occur over
the Olympics and Cascades through Friday with totals varying
between 2-4 inches with isolated higher amounts. Heavy snow is
also expected for the high peaks of the northern Cascades where
over a foot of snow is possible. This AR event should wrap up by
this evening when much of the Pacific moisture will have ran out
and the low pressure system will move into the Northern Rockies.
High temperatures for the Northern Plains will rise to 15-20
degrees above average out ahead of the aforementioned system on
Friday. Elevated Fire Weather risks are in effect for much of
Southern Texas, the Texas/Oklahoma panhandle and southeastern
Kansas due to decent winds and dry conditions.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0132 AM CDT Thu Oct 28 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough and associated surface low will slowly track
across the Ohio/Tennessee Valley areas through the day, with dry,
deep-layer northwesterly flow prevailing across the south-central
U.S. Near-critical to Critically dry and breezy surface conditions
are expected across portions of western Oklahoma into northwest
Texas. However, fuels are expected to remain poorly receptive to
fire spread at best given recent heavy rains, hence no introduction
of fire weather highlights.

Two narrow corridors exist though, for dry and breezy northwesterly
surface winds to overspread cured grasses relatively devoid of
recent rainfall accumulations, where Elevated highlights have been
maintained. First, widespread 15-20 mph sustained northwesterly
surface winds overlapping with 20% RH are likely across portions of
southeast Colorado/southwest Kansas into the Texas Panhandle.
Second, across Deep South Texas, surface northwesterly winds will
struggle to sustain above 15 mph for multiple consecutive hours,
though RH is expected to dip below 15% for several locales through
the afternoon.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The start of the medium range period on Sunday will feature a deep
upper low and associated surface low tracking into the Northeast,
though the bulk of the weather hazards associated with this system
should be into the Canadian Maritimes by then. Model guidance has
maintained reasonably good agreement and continuity over the past
few days and once again a consensus model blend provides a good
starting point.

Behind this, a shortwave should drag across the northern tier of
the U.S. as multiple shortwave perturbations rotate southward
providing reinforcement for mean troughing across the central into
parts of the Eastern U.S. through the middle of next week. Models
show good agreement with the initial shortwave through the Great
Lakes Sunday-Monday, but timing and detail differences quickly
begin to arise regarding energy rotating through the base of the
mean trough Tues-Thur next week.

Out West, the guidance continues to suggest a compact upper closed
low may slide into the Pacific Northwest, but diverge after day
3/Sunday regarding what happens to the remnant energy as it drops
southward through the Great Basin. The GFS has consistently been
south and faster with this system, while the ECMWF/UKMET/CMC
maintain better continuity with the ensemble means. There remains
enough run to run variability in this though across all the models
that confidence is low in the specifics. The next shortwave moves
into the Western U.S. by Monday of next week as another amplified
trough digs upstream becoming established off the West Coast by
Thursday.

The WPC progs for this cycle used a blend of the deterministic
solutions days 3-5 (with slightly more weighting towards the ECMWF
and CMC). After that, increased contributions from the ensemble
means in order to help mitigate the timing and detail differences
which arise mid to late period for several systems. This approach
also maintained reasonable continuity with the previous WPC
forecast as well.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Heavy rains associated with the departing Eastern U.S. cyclone
should lift into the Canadian Maritimes by the start of the period
on Sunday with only some lingering light showers across Maine and
interior New England. Elsewhere, light rain/mountain snows will be
possible Sunday across parts of the central Rockies and High
Plains. Some snow may be possible during the colder overnight
hours even at the lower elevations of the High Plains. Confidence
in the precise coverage and intensity of precipitation across
these regions remains low, based on the uncertainty of important
details of flow aloft. Locations from the southern Plains into the
Midwest/Ohio Valley and eventually the interior northeast should
see expanding coverage of rainfall along the potentially wavy
front early next week. Most of the rain should be on the light to
moderate side but there is a developing signal for some heavier
totals over or near the southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley
by next Tuesday or Wednesday. Pacific shortwave energy and
moisture may bring one or more episodes of precipitation to
central/northern parts of the West Coast Monday-Wednesday, still
with fairly modest confidence in the details at this time.

The only notable temperature hazard is below to much below normal
temperatures expanding across much of the Central U.S. through
much of the period. Areas from the northern High Plains through
the south-central Plains and east into the Middle Mississippi
Valley/Ohio Valley should see one or more days with highs 10-20F
below climatological values for this time of year. Anomalies for
min temperatures should be less extreme but could still be
noteworthy for producing the first freeze in some areas from the
central Plains into the Midwest around next Tuesday.

0133 AM CDT Thu Oct 28 2021

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
The mid-level trough and surface low across the eastern third of the
CONUS responsible for the southern Plains dry and breezy conditions
today/Day 1 will only gradually progress eastward tomorrow/Friday.
Though deep-layer (including surface) northwesterly flow will not be
as strong as it was today/Day 1, the air will remain dry, promoting
at least some grass-fire spread within a narrow corridor west of
where recent heavy rainfall has occurred. 15 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds will coincide with 15-20% RH atop dry
fuels from the eastern Texas Panhandle to the Rio Grande/Deep-South
Texas, prompting the introduction of Elevated highlights given
sufficiently dry fine fuels.

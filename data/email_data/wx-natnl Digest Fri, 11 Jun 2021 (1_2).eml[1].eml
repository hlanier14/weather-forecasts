Valid 101700Z - 111200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHEASTERN UTAH AND
NORTHWESTERN COLORADO...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL
WYOMING...

Ongoing forecast of extremely critical fire weather conditions for
portions of northeastern Utah and northwestern Colorado remains on
track. Critical fire weather conditions are also likely from
northern Arizona into central Wyoming.  Clear skies across the
region are allowing for strong surface heating and deep vertical
mixing, resulting in RH values already dropping to 10% and sustained
south-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph (gusts around 30 mph)
across much of the region this morning.  As the potent midlevel
trough, currently over northeastern Nevada, shifts
east-northeastward through the afternoon, enhanced flow aloft will
overspread the region with the VAD wind profiles at Salt Lake City
and Grand Junction are already indicating winds around 60 mph at 10
kft AGL.  As the boundary layer deepens through the afternoon, winds
at the surface will continue to increase through downward momentum
transfer, resulting in critical to extremely critical fire weather
conditions.  See previous discussion below for more information on
meteorological and fuel conditions.

..Jirak.. 06/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0144 AM CDT Thu Jun 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough, located in northwest Nevada at 06Z this morning,
will shift northeastward toward the northern Rockies by this
afternoon/evening. Lee troughing as a result of this approaching
upper-level wave will likely result in a surface low around 995mb by
mid evening across eastern Montana. In addition, a piece of the
eastern Pacific high-pressure area is forecast to break eastward in
the wake of the mid-level shortwave trough. This should result in a
tight pressure gradient and widespread strong winds across much of
the eastern Great Basin and portions of the northern and central
Rockies. An even more favorable area for strong sustained surface
winds will be in a belt from central Utah into north-central
Wyoming. In this area, surface winds will be aided by downward
momentum transfer of moderate to strong mid-level flow.

Widespread winds of 20 to 30 mph are anticipated. Sustained winds in
excess of 30 mph are forecast from south-central Utah into
north-central Wyoming. Relative humidity of 6 to 12 percent is
forecast across the region.

These winds and relative humidities suggest that meteorological
conditions will likely exceed extremely critical criteria. In
addition, fuels in the area are extremely dry. Dry and breezy
conditions the last 2 days have further increased the ERCs in this
region. Most area averaged ERCs are now well above the 90th
percentile with several approaching the 97th percentile. This alone
suggests very dry fuels in the region. However, there are numerous
large fires already burning across northeast Utah and northwest
Colorado which have been reported to have extreme fire behavior.
This further confirms the receptiveness of the fuels.

The extremely critical delineation primarily covers the region where
meteorological conditions and fuels support the potential for large
fires. The strongest winds may be in southern Wyoming, but this
region is mostly desert with only minimal burnable vegetation.

Additionally, some dry and breezy conditions are anticipated in the
lee of the Cascades and across portions of the Columbia Basin
tomorrow. Winds are not forecast to be overly strong and relative
humidity may not be as dry as the Great Basin. However, some
elevated conditions will be possible.

of
the period, mid-level low pressure is likely to build near the Pacific
coastline, helping to slowly reduce excessive heat potential. Model guidanc=

continues to support the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing over =
the
western Gulf of Mexico that may influence the Central or Western Gulf Coast
states. Elsewhere, mid-level low pressure is forecast near the Aleutians an=
d
across Eastern Canada but no associated hazards appear likely with these
features.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for portions of California, the Southwest, the
Great Basin, and the Rockies, Fri, Jun 18.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for most areas stretching from the Pacific
Coastal Ranges to the Rockies, Fri-Sat, Jun 18-19.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the West, Northern and Centra=

z6uK2fwgXob$

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 18 - THURSDAY JUNE 24: As with yesterday, high confidence
exists for widespread record-breaking high temperatures across the West at =
the
beginning of Week-2. This is tied to mid-level heights of 594 dm or more in
both today's 0Z ECMWF and 6Z GEFS ensemble means during Days 6-10. High,
moderate, and slight risks of excessive heat are indicated for the 18th, 18=
th
and 19th, and 18th-22nd, respectively, where reforecast guidance shows a
better
than 60%, 40%, and 20% chance of exceeding the climatological 85th percenti=
le
of daily maximum temperatures. The high risk for excessive heat on the 18th
corresponds closely to the region with the greatest likelihood of setting
daily
record highs from today's National Blend of Models (NBM). A selection of NB=
M
forecast highs (and present daily records) on the 18th includes: 118F in
Needles, CA (119F), 114F in Phoenix (115F), 108F in Fresno (107F), 102F in
Grand Junction (102F), 101F in Salt Lake City (102F), and 88F in Stanley, I=
D
(87F). The moderate risk on the 18th and 19th corresponds to a region of
slightly weaker heat signals in reforecast guidance, with only a handful of
daily record highs approached by the NBM. Beyond the 19th, heat signals
continue to weaken, with no record highs in the NBM and reforecast
probabilities exhibiting generally only 20-30% chance of exceeding the 85th
percentile of maximum temperatures. Some differences do persist in the
placement of prolonged heat, with the ECMWF focused more across the
north-central CONUS and the GEFS across the Great Basin, and both areas are
highlighted as a compromise between the guidance. Both models do show
troughing
building along the Pacific Northwest coastline late in the period helping t=
o
moderate temperatures closer to normal, resulting in the slight risk for
excessive heat timing out beyond the 22nd. Heat remains the number one sour=
ce
of weather-related fatalities in the U.S., so consider reviewing heat safet=
y
materials as the event approaches from:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/heat__;!!DZ3fjg!=
o_nYBw4UHdr5CsfXKEIVsRR793Wuvx0vh0xi_dkWkHm9n4TZ19bdqArA5q4BFz6uK-gK-R6I$ .



In addition to the heat concerns out West, the development of a thermal low
tied to the heat could help drive periodic high winds along the coastlines =
of
Oregon and Northern California throughout the period. A corresponding sligh=
t
risk for high winds (exceeding 40 mph) is posted for these areas. The ongoi=
ng
severe drought across much of the West coupled with the high temperatures a=
nd
low humidities forecast are likely to see an increase in fire weather conce=
rns
across much of the West. The National Interagency Fire Agency is highlighti=
ng
much of the West for moderate or high fire potential late in Week-1, with
these
conditions likely to persist into the early portion of Week-2.



While dry conditions are likely to accompany the western heat, one region n=
ot
in need of further rainfall are the states adjacent to the Western Gulf of
Mexico. Currently, observed soil moisture ranges here from 90 to 99% of
climatology in the most recent observations, tied to 30 day precipitation
generally being 200% of normal or greater. While Week-1 appears fairly dry =
for
the region, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to highlight the
possibility for a tropical cyclone to form over the western Gulf of Mexico
late
in Week-1 or early in Week-2. Guidance has trended closer with this system =
to
the Yucatan in recent runs, likely removing the eastern Gulf Coast from a
potential landfall. As such, a slight risk of heavy rain and high winds are
posted from South Texas eastward through western portions of the Florida
Panhandle on the 18th through 21st. The wind hazard is generally confined t=
o
the immediate coast, while the rain hazard bulges northward through the Low=
er
Mississippi Valley to account for the potential entrainment of the system i=
n
the westerlies. Flooding appears possible during Week-2 from any additional
rains stretching from East Texas through Mobile Bay. While the associated
hazards account for risks of high winds and heavy rain, significant
uncertainty
remains regarding track and intensity of this disturbance with the forecast
likely to be refined as the lead time decreases. For more on this system
please
stay tuned to subsequent Week-2 U.S. Hazards outlooks, as well as the Frida=
y
update of the Global Tropical Hazards Outlook at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/C=

WkHm9n4TZ19bdqArA5q4BFz6uK3zphho9$ .



Alaska is forecast to experience anomalous 500-hPa ridging, resulting in a
tilt
toward above-normal temperatures being favored. Precipitation signals are
mixed
across the state, but any convection that develops could be a concern given
the
timing near the climatological peak of fire season and associated lightning
potential.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
255 PM EDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Jun 13 2021 - 12Z Thu Jun 17 2021

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West and the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to
the northern Plains where the duration of the heat will become
excessive and dangerous.  Troughing exiting New England will dig
back into the East next week supporting reinforcing cool air
intrusions from Canada and a chance of showers/storms.  A Pacific
front will likely push into the Pacific Northwest early next week
and should be moving across the northern Plains by the latter part
of next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Guidance from major models and ensembles continue to show very
good agreement for an amplified flow pattern gradually progressing
eastward across the CONUS during the medium range period
(Sunday-Thursday).  A 594+ dm upper high expanding across the Four
Corners and central Rockies toward the northern Plains next week
will ensure a heat wave to encompass areas from California through
much of the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to
indicate run-to-run variability of the timing and amplitude of
shortwave energy digging across the Great Lakes to Northeast, and
a general trend for a more amplified trough to potentially close
off over Quebec by Tuesday onward.  The ECMWF continues to show
much less-defined reinforcing cold fronts dipping across the
Northeast than the GFS and CMC.

The WPC medium-range forecast this cycle was derived from a
composite blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, with a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were incorporated for Days 5-7 to handle the
uncertainty over the Northeast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest through the northern
Plains late this weekend through much of next week.  Departures
from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily records likely
to be set Monday-Wednesday.  High temperatures well into the 110s
will be possible across the Southwest while upper 90s to lower
100s will be possible from Utah into portions of the northern
Plains as well as the lower elevations of the northern Rockies.
Little relief at night is expected with nighttime lows 10F to as
much as 20F above normal.  The duration of this type of heat,
especially for areas in the northern tier unaccustomed to
prolonged heat waves, will become dangerous for sensitive groups.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near
to slightly above normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast next week behind a cold front. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall -- the
exceptions being over the Northwest as a front moves in this
weekend and possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late
this weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls
and lingers.

Finally, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico for any potential for tropical cyclone
development toward the latter part of next week.

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West and the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to
the northern Plains where the duration of the heat will become
excessive and dangerous.  Troughing exiting New England will dig
back into the East next week supporting reinforcing cool air
intrusions from Canada and a chance of showers/storms.  A Pacific
front will likely push into the Pacific Northwest early next week
and should be moving across the northern Plains by the latter part
of next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Guidance from major models and ensembles continue to show very
good agreement for an amplified flow pattern gradually progressing
eastward across the CONUS during the medium range period
(Sunday-Thursday).  A 594+ dm upper high expanding across the Four
Corners and central Rockies toward the northern Plains next week
will ensure a heat wave to encompass areas from California through
much of the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to
indicate run-to-run variability of the timing and amplitude of
shortwave energy digging across the Great Lakes to Northeast, and
a general trend for a more amplified trough to potentially close
off over Quebec by Tuesday onward.  The ECMWF continues to show
much less-defined reinforcing cold fronts dipping across the
Northeast than the GFS and CMC.

The WPC medium-range forecast this cycle was derived from a
composite blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, with a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were incorporated for Days 5-7 to handle the
uncertainty over the Northeast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest through the northern
Plains late this weekend through much of next week.  Departures
from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily records likely
to be set Monday-Wednesday.  High temperatures well into the 110s
will be possible across the Southwest while upper 90s to lower
100s will be possible from Utah into portions of the northern
Plains as well as the lower elevations of the northern Rockies.
Little relief at night is expected with nighttime lows 10F to as
much as 20F above normal.  The duration of this type of heat,
especially for areas in the northern tier unaccustomed to
prolonged heat waves, will become dangerous for sensitive groups.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near
to slightly above normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast next week behind a cold front. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall -- the
exceptions being over the Northwest as a front moves in this
weekend and possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late
this weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls
and lingers.

Finally, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico for any potential for tropical cyclone
development toward the latter part of next week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Thu June 10 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 16 - 20 2021

Today's model solutions are in a good agreement on the 500-hPa circulation
pattern across the forecast domain during the 6-10 day period. An amplified
pattern is predicted with a strong mean ridge and positive mid-level height
anomalies over the western CONUS and a mean trough over the eastern CONUS
leading to near to below-normal mid-level heights. Weak negative 500-hPa
height
anomalies are predicted over the western Gulf Coast, associated with unsett=
led
weather later in the 6-10 day period. Over Alaska, positive mid-level heigh=
t
anomalies are favored in association with the northward extension of a mean
ridge over the North Pacific. 500-hPa heights diminish from above-normal to
more near-normal over the central and western Aleutians, underneath mean
troughing over the Bering Sea.

Troughing centered over the Bering Sea and associated southerly to
southwesterly flow are forecast to favor relatively warm conditions for
Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Downstream, anomalously strong ridging
predicted over much of the western CONUS favors enhanced probabilities of
above-normal temperatures across most of the western CONUS, extending to th=
e
Central and Northern Plains and Midwest. Probabilities of above-normal
temperatures exceed 90 percent across parts of the interior West. Northerly
and
northeasterly surface flow favored early in the 6-10 day period tilts odds
toward below-normal temperatures from southern Texas northeastward to the
Tennessee Valley, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast. Below-normal temperature
probabilities in Texas and the Northeast are increased (>40%) due to
above-normal soil moisture and enhanced northwesterly surface flow,
respectively. Above-normal temperatures are favored in Florida, ahead of a
mean
frontal boundary forecast across the Southeast.

Forecast troughing centered over the Bering Sea is not as zonally expansive=
,
compared to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast, which favors near to above-norma=
l
precipitation over the Aleutians and the western and northern Alaska Mainla=
nd.
With the westward retraction of the troughing to the Bering Sea, increased
ridging is favored over much of the Alaska Mainland in today's 6-10 day
forecast, increasing odds for below-normal precipitation over the southeast=
ern
Mainland and Panhandle. Anomalously strong ridging and positive height
anomalies predicted over much of the western and central CONUS are expected=
 to
significantly increase chances of below-normal precipitation across much of
the
northern and central CONUS, especially over parts of the Northern Rockies
eastward to the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley. Increased potential fo=
r
tropical activity in the western Gulf of Mexico late in the period elevates
odds for above-normal precipitation across the western Gulf Coast. Models
predict increased odds of above-normal precipitation in the Southwest as so=
me
of the Gulf moisture is favored to be advected into the region, aided by
increased southerly flow between a thermal surface low over the Desert
Southwest and a localized area of high pressure over the Four Corners Regio=
n.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 45% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 55% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Me=
an
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the model solutions in depicting an amplified pattern
across the domain, offset by some uncertainties and differences among the
precipitation and temperature forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 18 - 24 2021

During the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is forecast to
persist, but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Today's mid-level
height pattern consists of a mean trough over the Bering Sea, leading to we=
ak
below-normal mid-level heights across the western Aleutians. Positive 500-h=
Pa
height anomalies are favored elsewhere over Alaska, associated with a stron=
g
mean ridge over the Northeast Pacific. Mean anticyclonic flow over the West
favors above-normal mid-level heights over the western half of the CONUS, w=
ith
weak positive 500-hPa height anomalies extending to the Southeast. Weak
negative mid-level height anomalies are predicted along the Rio Grande Vall=
ey
in Texas, associated with the tail end of a mean frontal boundary at that
surface early in the Week-2 period. Negative mid-level height anomalies ove=
r
the Northeast and Great Lakes are associated with a mean trough that is
favored
to deamplify throughout the Week-2 period.

Above-normal temperatures are favored for much of Mainland Alaska and the
Aleutians, associated with mean southerly flow. Positive 500-hPa height
anomalies over the western CONUS favor above-normal temperatures across the
western CONUS. Enhanced above-normal temperature probabilities extend eastw=
ard
across the Central and Northern Plains to the Great Lakes, as temperatures =
are
predicted to increase during the Week-2 period across the north-central CON=
US.
Near to below-normal temperatures are expected over parts of the Southern
Plains, extending northeastward to the Northeast, but diminished compared t=
o
yesterday's Week-2 forecast, as temperatures are favored to increase
throughout
the period. Probabilities of above-normal temperatures are slightly elevate=
d
from Florida northward to the Carolinas, as surface flow becomes more
southerly
throughout the Week-2 period.

Forecast troughing centered over the Bering Sea favors mean southerly flow =
and
above-normal precipitation over the Aleutians and western Mainland Alaska.
Below-normal precipitation odds are increased for the northwestern and cent=
ral
CONUS, associated with mean ridging over the western CONUS. The increased
potential for increased moisture flow from the Gulf of Mexico favors elevat=
ed
odds of above-normal precipitation across the central and western Gulf Coas=
t
States. Similar to the 6-10 day period, models favor a surface pattern
conducive for some of this moisture to be pulled into the Southwest. Odds t=
ilt
toward below-normal precipitation in the Florida Peninsula, south of a mean
frontal boundary.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble M=
ean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
agreement among model circulation patterns over the forecast domain, offset=
 by
increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitat=
ion
forecast tools, and uncertainty in the tropics.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)
for the region from 20N to 70N latitude and 175E to 60W longitude
include the 5 day periods centered on the following dates:

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West and the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to

eastward across the CONUS during the medium range period
(Sunday-Thursday).  A 594+ dm upper high expanding across the Four
Corners and central Rockies toward the northern Plains next week
will ensure a heat wave to encompass areas from California through

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest through the northern
Plains late this weekend through much of next week.  Departures
from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily records likely

...Record to dangerous heat this weekend into early next week
across much of the interior West and the northern Plains...

...Extreme heat possible for the Southwest next week...

...Overview...
Anomalously strong upper ridge building and amplifying through the
central U.S. into next week will continue the much above normal
temperatures across much of the West into the northern Plains.
Record heat will be possible early next week from the Southwest to
the northern Plains where the duration of the heat will become
excessive and dangerous.  Troughing exiting New England will dig
back into the East next week supporting reinforcing cool air
intrusions from Canada and a chance of showers/storms.  A Pacific
front will likely push into the Pacific Northwest early next week
and should be moving across the northern Plains by the latter part
of next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
Guidance from major models and ensembles continue to show very
good agreement for an amplified flow pattern gradually progressing
eastward across the CONUS during the medium range period
(Sunday-Thursday).  A 594+ dm upper high expanding across the Four
Corners and central Rockies toward the northern Plains next week
will ensure a heat wave to encompass areas from California through
much of the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to
indicate run-to-run variability of the timing and amplitude of
shortwave energy digging across the Great Lakes to the Northeast,
and a general trend for a more amplified trough to potentially
close off over Quebec by Tuesday onward.  The ECMWF continues to
show much less-defined reinforcing cold fronts dipping across the
Northeast than the GFS and CMC.

The WPC medium-range forecast this cycle was derived from a
composite blend of the 00Z ECMWF/EC mean, 06Z GFS/GEFS, with a
smaller contribution from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean.  More of the
ensemble means were incorporated for Days 5-7 to handle the
uncertainty over the Northeast.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The upper ridge over the central U.S. will keep temperatures much
above normal from portions of the Southwest through the northern
Plains late this weekend through much of next week.  Departures
from normal of 15F to 25F will be common with daily records likely
to be set Monday-Wednesday.  High temperatures well into the 110s
will be possible across the Southwest while upper 90s to lower
100s will be possible from Utah into portions of the northern
Plains as well as the lower elevations of the northern Rockies.
Little relief at night is expected with nighttime lows 10F to as
much as 20F above normal.  The duration of this type of heat,
especially for areas in the northern tier unaccustomed to
prolonged heat waves, will become dangerous for sensitive groups.

Elsewhere across the CONUS, temperatures are expected to be near
to slightly above normal, perhaps a bit below normal over the
Great Lakes into the Northeast next week behind a cold front. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall -- the
exceptions being over the Northwest as a front moves in this
weekend and possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late
this weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls
and lingers.

Finally, the National Hurricane Center is monitoring the
southwestern Gulf of Mexico for any potential for tropical cyclone
development toward the latter part of next week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0241 PM CDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Despite some dry, gusty post-frontal winds tomorrow (Friday) across
portions of the High Plains from eastern Montana into the Texas
Panhandle, the overall lack of fuel readiness and receptiveness
should limit the concern for large fires.  See the previous
discussion (below) for more details.

..Jirak.. 06/10/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0148 AM CDT Thu Jun 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
The mid-level shortwave trough and associated jet streak and lee
cyclogenesis which accompanied it will move northeastward into
Canada during the day tomorrow (Fri). However, in its wake, a
somewhat tight pressure gradient is forecast to linger across
northeast Montana and western North Dakota. This may result in 15 to
20 mph winds amid relative humidity of 15 to 25 percent on Friday.
However, ongoing precipitation this morning and forecast
precipitation this afternoon/evening may be sufficient to moisten
fuels and limit the concern for large fires.

Elsewhere, localized elevated conditions may be possible in portions
of the Great Basin, but the more consistent moderate mid-level flow
is forecast to remain across the Northwest where higher
moisture/cooler temperatures are forecast.

416 PM EDT Thu Jun 10 2021

Valid 00Z Fri Jun 11 2021 - 00Z Sun Jun 13 2021

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Tennessee and the Lower Mississippi Valleys and parts of the
Mid-Atlantic...

...There is a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Northern Plains through Friday morning...

...Extreme to Elevated Fire Weather conditions are in place across
much of the Interior West...

A front extends from the Mid-Atlantic to the Upper Great Lakes
then westward to the Northern High Plains trailing off the
southwest over the Great Basin. The main low will move eastward to
the Great Lakes by Saturday evening, while parts of the boundary
will linger over parts of the Mid-Atlantic.  Multiple upper-level
impulses are east of the Mississippi River, one over the
Mid-Atlantic, second over the Middle Mississippi Valley, and the
third over the interior Central Gulf Coast.  The upper-level
energy over the interior Central Gulf Coast will produce showers
and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain. The WPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The
associated heavy rain will create numerous areas of flash
flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Friday morning.

Also, the thunderstorms over the Mid-Atlantic will produce heavy
rain over the region. The WPC has issued a Moderate Risk of
excessive rainfall with these thunderstorms.  The associated heavy
rain will make numerous areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many
streams may flood, potentially affecting larger rivers through
Friday morning.  The area ahead of the front in the Rockies will
be venerable to fire weather conditions. There will be low
relative humidity and gusty wind in the area ahead of the front,
which has led to an Extreme Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Rockies/Great Basin.

Meanwhile, the part of the front over the Northern Plains will
produce showers and thunderstorms.  The SPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of severe thunderstorms over the Northern Plains through
Friday morning.  The hazards associated with these thunderstorms
are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and
a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater probability of wind
gust of 65 knots or greater over parts of the Northern/Central
Plains.  Additionally, there is a 10% or greater probability of
two-inch or great hail over parts of the Northern/Central High
Plains through Friday morning. Moreover, some of the highest
elevations of the Northern Rockies will get snow on Thursday
evening into Friday.  The severe thunderstorm threat weakens on
Saturday and moves to the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley.

Scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop east of the
Mississippi River on Friday and Saturday.  With the upper-level
energy over the Mid-Atlantic, the WPC has issued a Moderate Risk
of excessive rainfall over the area on Friday into Saturday
morning.  The associated heavy rain will produce numerous areas of
flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers through Saturday morning.  In the
meantime, a weak front will come onshore over the Pacific
Northwest on Friday and dissipate by Saturday morning. The system
will produce rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest through
Saturday afternoon.

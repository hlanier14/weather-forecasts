Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1153 AM CDT Fri May 07 2021

Valid 071700Z - 081200Z

An isolated dry thunderstorm area was added across portions of
western New Mexico. As boundary-layer mixing intensifies with
continued heating and upslope-flow along steeper terrain, at least
isolated high-based thunderstorms are expected to develop atop a
very dry sfc-500 mb dry sub-cloud layer. Precipitable water values
are expected to range from 0.3-0.6 inches across western New Mexico
per latest guidance consensus, with deep-layer flow fields above 20
kts supporting relatively faster storm motions. Adequate buoyancy
residing in the -20 to -30C layer also supports enough lightning
production to warrant isolated dry thunderstorm highlights. While
fuel receptiveness to fire spread is not particularly robust across
western New Mexico, several subsequent days of expected dry and
breezy conditions may exacerbate any holdovers ignited by Day 1
strikes to support fire spread, which was the primary motivator for
adding an isolated dry thunderstorm delineation. Isolated dry
thunderstorms are also expected this afternoon across portions of
the Great Basin, but fuels are even less receptive across this
region compared to points farther south, precluding isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights.

The Elevated area was also expanded farther west across portions of
the Colorado River Basin, where model guidance consensus shows 15-25
mph sustained winds overlapping with 15-20% RH over dry fuels for
multiple hours this afternoon. Locally Critical conditions also
remain possible across much of the Southwest contained within the
Elevated area. Otherwise, the forecast remains on track for portions
of the northern High Plains and the Southeast. Please refer to the
previous outlook below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 05/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0320 AM CDT Fri May 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An amplified upper-air pattern will persist across the today. A deep
upper trough over the eastern CONUS will shift slowly eastward
today. Likewise, an upper trough will move eastward across the
Pacific Northwest, as an downstream ridge shifts eastward over the
Plains. A surface ridge will build into portions of the Northwest
and Great Basin, as a surface low moves into the northern High
Plains and a lee trough develops southward into the southern High
Plains.

...Eastern AZ/UT into Western NM/CO...
Increasing low-level flow amidst a very warm/dry airmass will result
in elevated to locally critical conditions from northern/eastern AZ
into eastern UT and western NM/CO. Surface winds are expected to
increase to 15-25 mph during the afternoon as RH drops into the
8-15% range. Some dry thunderstorm activity cannot be ruled out from
western into central NM, though uncertainty regarding coverage and
fuel receptivity precludes adding an isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation at this time.

...Eastern MT into Western ND...
Relatively dry and breezy conditions to the north/northeast of a
developing surface low across WY will result in a threat of elevated
to locally critical conditions from eastern MT into western ND.
Given the very dry airmass observed over the region on Thursday,
greater weight was given to the drier guidance, which suggests the
potential for surface winds of 15-20 mph concurrent with minimum RH
values of 15-25%. There remains some uncertainty as to how far east
the stronger winds will develop across ND, but have expanded the
Elevated area somewhat eastward given ongoing extreme drought across
the area.

...FL/GA into the Carolinas...
Dry northwesterly flow is forecast to develop in the wake of a cold
front from FL/GA into portions of the Carolinas today. Sustained
winds of 15-18 mph across the Carolinas and 12-15 mph southward into
FL, combined with anomalously dry conditions (RH potentially
dropping below 30% across much of the region), will result in
elevated to locally critical meteorological conditions this
afternoon. Fuel conditions likely vary quite a bit across the region
due to recent rainfall and differing levels of long-term
precipitation/drought, but due to the unseasonably dry airmass and
potential for winds to approach critical criteria, have opted to
include an Elevated delineation for this region.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT May 07 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is good run to run continuity and agreement amongst the
dynamical models regarding the development of surface low pressure and return
flow to increase the potential for heavy precipitation and high winds across
many parts of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley during the early to
middle portion of week-2. Over Alaska, enhanced onshore flow from the Gulf of
Alaska is expected to bring above normal precipitation to portions of the
southern Mainland early in the period.

FOR SATURDAY MAY 15 - FRIDAY MAY 21: Both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF 500-hPa
height anomaly forecasts feature a mid-level shortwave trough lifting out over
the northeastern CONUS, with positive height departures centered upstream over
the Rockies towards the end of week-1. By the start of week-2, the 0z ECMWF
ensemble mean continues to favor the development of anomalous troughing
centered over the northwestern CONUS, and positive mid-level height departures
overspreading much of the eastern CONUS by day 10 (May 17). Increasing
mid-level heights over the eastern U.S. are also depicted in the GEFS during
this time, however, the development of troughing across the West is more muted
in the 0z and 6z GEFS ensemble means compared to the ECMWF. Despite these
differences, the predicted mid-level pattern flip from late week-1 into week-2
favored by both models is expected to promote surface low pressure development
predominately west of the Mississippi and elevate chances for above-normal,
and
possible heavy precipitation and high winds across parts of the Great Plains
and Mississippi Valley. Signals for anomalous temperatures look to be most
pronounced at the start of the period. These temperatures, however, are not
anticipated to reach hazard thresholds given the overall low amplitude,
transient mid-level pattern forecast.



Similar to yesterday's guidance, there is relatively good agreement in the
GEFS
and ECMWF daily ensemble means depiction of surface high pressure shifting
across the eastern CONUS allowing for a moist, low-level return flow across
much of the central U.S through the middle part of the period. Relative to
previous model runs, higher daily precipitation amounts are favored in the
ensemble means tied to forecast deepening surface low pressure in the lee of
the Rockies. Reforecast tools continue to indicate at least a 20% chance of
3-day rainfall accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch over
much
of the Plains and the Mississippi Valley which supports maintaining a slight
risk of heavy precipitation for the region from May 16 to May 19. This risk
area is slightly expanded in today's outlook to include parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley due to increased signals for heavy precipitation in the
reforecast tool guidance. Some consideration was given to include a moderate
risk of heavy precipitation based on higher signals in raw dynamical model
output, however; this increased risk remains unsupported in the reforecast
tools. The continued anomalous wet outlook is likely to further reduce drought
coverage across portions of Texas, although any locally heavy rainfall may
trigger localized flooding in eastern Texas and into the Lower Mississippi
Valley, where there are saturated soils due to recent heavy rainfall and
above-normal precipitation is forecast during week-1.



Strong pressure gradients continue to be favored in many of the deterministic
and ensemble mean solutions across the central CONUS which supports a slight
risk of high winds from May 15 to May 18. Reforecast tool guidance indicates
elevated chances for sustained winds exceeding the 85th percentile over the
Plains and Mississippi Valley where the ECMWF reforecast tool is especially
bullish with this signal across Texas extending to Missouri. Any gusty winds
west of the dry line over the drought affected regions of the southern High
Plains would likely enhance wildfire danger and blowing dust.



Over Alaska, forecast anomalous mid-level troughing is anticipated to bring
enhanced onshore flow to parts of the southern Mainland. Although reforecast
tool guidance shows pockets of 3-day precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th
percentile over the southwestern Mainland, these amounts are not likely to
exceed hazard thresholds, thus no corresponding hazards are issued.
Above-normal temperatures remain favored over much of the State during week-2,
and dynamical models have not deviated much with this likelihood during the
last few days. It is anticipated that any sharp rise in the temperature
outlook
would adversely affect the ongoing river ice break-up season, where many
rivers
are opening up and have been largely free of ice jams to induce flooding.

...Heavy rain possible over parts of the South early-mid week...

...Well below normal temperatures over the central High Plains
with some snow in the central Rockies early next week...

...Overview...

Between mean ridging aloft expected to prevail over the
northeastern Pacific and northwestern Caribbean, a blocky pattern
that develops over the western U.S./Canada during the weekend
should become more progressive next week.  Early next week an
upper trough emerging from the West combined with low level
upslope flow will produce chilly temperatures and enhanced
rain/higher elevation snow over the central Rockies/High Plains.
Southern stream energy and then this upper trough will interact
with a front that settles along the Gulf Coast for a time,
bringing the potential for heavy rain/thunderstorms over areas
from the southern Plains into the Southeast.  Other parts of the
East Coast may see meaningful precipitation as well.  The West
should see a warming trend as an upper ridge moves into/across the
region.  By Friday a modest upper trough nearing/reaching the West
Coast may reverse that trend over the Northwest.

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET offered
reasonable clustering within the ensemble spread to use as a
starting point. After next Wednesday, the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian had
some more favorable-than-not aspects over the CONUS, but each was
a bit removed from the good ensemble consensus to warrant a
lessening of their inputs. By next Fri, relied on an ensemble
blend along with the previous forecast which still fit well with
the ongoing thinking in a quasi-zonal/progressive pattern.

Trend has been toward a more defined upper system in the Northeast
(southeast Canada) next Tue on the heels of the departing sfc wave
through the northern Mid-Atlantic/Southern New England Mon.
Ensemble guidance has been mostly stable with the longwave pattern
by the end of next week, suggesting a coastal low off the NC coast
next Thu, but east-west differences in recent ECMWF/GEFS ensemble
runs persist.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early next week expect a period of enhanced precipitation over the
central Rockies/High Plains from the combination of the upper
trough over the West and strong Plains high pressure leading to
low level upslope flow.  Accumulating snow is likely in the higher
terrain of Colorado and Wyoming while cold rain should fall in
lower elevations.  Otherwise much of the West should be fairly dry
through the period.

Moisture and southern stream shortwave energy along a front
settling toward the Gulf Coast may already support some areas of
moderate to heavy rainfall across the South to start the week.
Then the progression of the western upper trough may produce some
waviness along the front and intensify rainfall from parts of the
southern Plains through the Southeast.  Some areas across the
southern tier may be sensitive to this additional rainfall in
light of significant totals received over the past week, though at
least late this week into the weekend should be fairly dry over
the South.  Some of the southern tier moisture may extend farther
northward over the eastern U.S. mid-late week as potential low
pressure develops.

During Monday-Tuesday the temperatures over the central portions
of the High Plains/eastern slopes of the Rockies should be more
reminiscent of March, with highs up to 20-25F below early May
averages.  This region will see a steady warming trend after
Tuesday, possibly to the point of seeing highs 5-10F above normal
by next Friday.  Much of the central and eastern U.S. should see
multiple days with highs 5-15F below normal due to the influence
of an upper trough over the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48
during the first half of the week and Canadian high pressure
reaching areas to the east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile above
average temperatures will expand across the West as an upper ridge
progresses into and across the region.  The best potential of plus
10-20F anomalies for highs will be from parts of California and
Oregon into the Great Basin.  The Pacific Northwest may see a
cooling trend late next week with the arrival of an upper trough.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri May 07 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 13 - 17 2021

The GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian dynamical models are in decent agreement with
regard to the 6-10 day 500-hPa geopotential height pattern over North America.
Troughing and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies are predicted over
the Bering Sea and southward across the western Aleutians. Above normal 500-
hPa
heights are depicted elsewhere over Alaska. Across the western CONUS,
increased
mid-level troughing is predicted, compared to yesterday's 6-10 day forecast,
while in the eastern CONUS, mean troughing is forecast to deamplify. Over the
central CONUS, weak anticyclonic mid-level flow is predicted.

Increased probabilities for below normal temperatures are highlighted across
much of the eastern CONUS, as a low pressure system is forecast to traverse
the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic with northerly surface flow ushering in cooler air
on its west side early in the period. Probabilities for above normal
temperatures are enhanced over the southern Florida Peninsula, ahead of the
associated mean frontal boundary. Above normal temperatures are favored over
much of the western CONUS, extending from the Central and Southern Plains
westward to the Pacific and northward to the Pacific Northwest, underneath
positive mid-level height anomalies extending southeastward from the Northeast
Pacific ridge. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across Alaska
underneath increased ridging to the south and enhanced southerly surface and
mid-level flow ahead of a mean trough over the Bering Sea.

Above normal precipitation is favored in the Northeast and the southern
Florida
Peninsula, associated with the low pressure system and trailing frontal
boundary that is expected to exit the East Coast during the period. Behind
this
frontal boundary, high pressure is expected to dominate over the Southeast
through much of the period, favoring below normal precipitation. Southerly
flow
to the west of surface high pressure in the Southeast increases odds of above
normal precipitation over the parts of the Great Plains, Midwest, and Great
Lakes. Below normal precipitation is favored from the Central and Southern
High
Plains westward to the Great Basin and northern West Coast, underneath
positive
mid-level height anomalies. Over southern Alaska, an active storm track is
favored on the northern periphery of the mean Pacific ridge, leading to
increased odds of above normal precipitation.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
decent
agreement in the model mid-level height forecasts, offset by differences among
the forecast tools in the predicted temperature and precipitation fields.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 15 - 21 2021

The predicted 500-hPa height pattern during the Week-2 period depicts mean
mid-level troughing across the western CONUS. This favors weakly below normal
mid-level heights over the West, extending to the Central and Northern Plains.
Positive height anomalies are predicted elsewhere over the CONUS, underneath
mean ridging and anticyclonic mid-level flow. Over Alaska, 500-hPa heights are
also favored to lean toward below normal, with negative height anomalies
predicted for much of the Mainland, associated with mean troughing over the
Bering Sea and western Alaska. Weakly above normal 500-hPa heights are
depicted
over the western Aleutians and the Alaska Panhandle, due to increased
influence
from mean ridging over the Northeast Pacific.

Below normal temperature probabilities are increased across the West Coast and
northern Rockies, with increased troughing relative to yesterday's Week-2
forecast. As high pressure shifts eastward across the Southeast throughout the
period, return flow from the Gulf of Mexico on its western periphery favors
increased probabilities of above normal temperatures from the Great Basin
eastward to the Mississippi River Valley. Above normal temperatures are also
favored in the southern Florida Peninsula, ahead of a mean frontal boundary to
the south of mean surface high pressure over the Southeast. Mean southerly to
southwesterly flow favors above normal temperatures across much of Alaska.

Odds tilt toward below normal precipitation in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic,
associated with mean surface high pressure. Above normal precipitation is
weakly favored in the southern Florida Peninsula, along a mean frontal
boundary. Increased odds of above normal precipitation in the Central CONUS
are
associated with southerly flow and moisture advection from the Gulf of Mexico
behind surface high pressure in the Southeast and ahead of a mean mid-level
trough over the West. Enhanced above normal precipitation probabilities extend
westward from the Northern Plains to the Pacific Northwest, as the increased
troughing over the West favors increased Pacific mid-level flow. Despite the
mean trough over the Western CONUS, energy crossing the southern Rockies is
not
favored to amplify until it reaches the Plains, leading to enhanced below
normal precipitation probabilities in the Four Corners. Above normal
precipitation chances continue to be increased over Alaska due to troughing
over the Bering Sea and the west coast of mainland Alaska and the ridging over
the eastern Pacific, favoring an active storm track across southern Alaska.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
day-to-day consistency in the ECMWF and Canadian ensemble model guidance,
offset by continued uncertainty in GEFS and the temperature fields over the
CONUS and Alaska.

FORECASTER: Adam Hartman

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0253 PM CDT Fri May 07 2021

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF SOUTHERN INTO CENTRAL AND
EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WESTERN PARTS OF THE TEXAS PANHANDLE...

Widespread Critical meteorological conditions are likely in a
post-dryline environment across New Mexico into the Texas Panhandle.
Fuel receptiveness to fire spread is relatively mediocre, with ERCs
across the region being below average for this time of year.
Nonetheless, widespread 25+ mph sustained westerly surface winds
overlapping with 5-15% RH for at least a few hours during the
afternoon should promote enough of a wildfire-spread threat to
warrant an eastward expansion of Critical highlights. The Elevated
delineation across the Southwest was also extended farther westward
across portions of the Lower Colorado River Basin given higher
potential for Elevated conditions for multiple hours along the
Arizona/Utah border, where fuels are receptive to fire spread.

Likewise, portions of the Elevated in northern California were
extended southward a bit to account for the latest guidance
consensus depicting Elevated conditions extending into northern
parts of the San Joaquin Valley. An Elevated area across portions of
central into southeast North Carolina was strongly considered this
outlook. While Elevated meteorological conditions are expected, fuel
receptiveness across southern portions of North Carolina will likely
be tempered by recent heavy rains, precluding Elevated highlights.

..Squitieri.. 05/07/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0258 AM CDT Fri May 07 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper trough is forecast to deepen and move eastward across the
interior West into the Plains on Saturday, as a surface low deepens
across portions of the central/southern High Plains during the day
and begins to move eastward Saturday night. An expansive surface
ridge is forecast to remain in place over the eastern Pacific, with
an extension of the ridge persisting into the Pacific Northwest and
Great Basin.

...Northern CA...
Northerly surface flow is forecast to increase across portions of
northern/central CA on Saturday, as the extension of the Pacific
surface ridge increases the Sacramento to Medford pressure gradient.
Sustained winds of 15-25 mph combined with minimum RH values of
8-15% will result in elevated to potentially critical fire weather
conditions. Based on current guidance, the strongest winds are
expected across western portions of the Sacramento Valley and
adjacent higher terrain, where a critical delineation has been
introduced. Today will be the first day of potentially a 2-3 day
stretch of elevated to critical conditions across the region.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
Critical meteorological conditions are expected across much of NM
into portions of west TX on Saturday, as stronger southwesterly flow
spreads eastward on conjunction with the upper trough. Sustained
winds of 20-25 mph (locally higher) are expected concurrent with
minimum RH values of 5-15%. The primary uncertainty regarding the
fire weather threat is the state of fuels across the region. While
critical wind/RH conditions will likely spread into the southern
High Plains, greenup and recent rainfall should temper the threat
with eastward extent. A critical area has been introduced where
confidence is highest in the presence of at least modestly favorable
fuels, and some expansion of the critical area is possible depending
on precipitation (or lack thereof) on D1/Friday.

...Carolinas/Virginia into the Southeast...
Dry conditions are forecast to persist into Saturday from the FL
Peninsula northward into the Carolinas and Virginia, though wind
speeds from SC southward into GA/FL are expected to be somewhat
weaker compared to D1/Friday. Somewhat stronger flow may support
sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph across parts of NC and VA,
which would support the potential for elevated fire weather
conditions. However, due to the potential for substantial rainfall
over NC/VA on D1/Friday, no elevated delineation has been made at
this time.

...Some late-season snowfall is expected across the northern
Rockies to northern High Plains...

...A low pressure system will bring moderate to heavy rain across
the Midwest this weekend with severe weather possible across the
central Plains toward the lower Mississippi...

More active weather is forecast to move across the mid-section of
the country toward the northeastern U.S. into the weekend as a low
pressure system intensifies along a frontal boundary.  The low
pressure system is currently in its formative stage as it spreads
late-season snowfall across the northern Rockies to the nearby
High Plains.  As an upper-level trough exits the western U.S. and
interacts with the frontal boundary, the low pressure system is
expected to intensify more rapidly as it tracks across the central
Plains into the Midwest during the weekend.  A swath of moderate
to heavy rain to expanded to expand across the Midwest into the
Ohio Valley late Saturday into Sunday, possibly reaching western
New York by Sunday evening.  Farther south, severe weather is
possible in the central Plains on Saturday, pushing toward the
lower Mississippi on Sunday ahead of a cold front.  Meanwhile,
additional mountain snow is expected across the northern Rockies
while showers and some thunderstorms are expected to develop over
the central Rockies and High Plains ahead of a warm front.

Farther east, scattered showers and thunderstorms are expected
into this evening across the lower Great Lakes and the
Mid-Atlantic as a couple of weak low pressure systems move across.
 Some wet snow is also possible over the higher elevations of the
central Appalachians tonight.  These showers and a few
thunderstorms may linger into Saturday afternoon over parts of the
Northeast before the weak low pressure systems move out to sea.

In terms of temperatures, broad upper-level troughing will keep
temperatures below normal from across the northern tier states to
much of the eastern U.S. into Saturday before warm air spreads
into the Carolinas on Sunday.  Very warm temperatures will also be
found across the southern High Plains on Saturday south of the
intensifying low pressure system, where fire weather risk is
elevated to critical into the southern Rockies.  The fire weather
risk is forecast to be critical across parts of interior northern
California as well on Saturday.

...Heavy rain possible over parts of the South early-mid week...

...Well below normal temperatures over the central High Plains
with some snow in the central Rockies early next week...

...Overview...

Between mean ridging aloft expected to prevail over the
northeastern Pacific and northwestern Caribbean, a blocky pattern
that develops over the western U.S./Canada during the weekend
should become more progressive next week.  Early next week an
upper trough emerging from the West combined with low level
upslope flow will produce chilly temperatures and enhanced
rain/higher elevation snow over the central Rockies/High Plains.
Southern stream energy and then this upper trough will interact
with a front that settles along the Gulf Coast for a time,
bringing the potential for heavy rain/thunderstorms over areas
from the southern Plains into the Southeast.  Other parts of the
East Coast may see meaningful precipitation as well.  The West
should see a warming trend as an upper ridge moves into/across the
region.  By Friday a modest upper trough nearing/reaching the West
Coast may reverse that trend over the Northwest.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Through the 00Z/06Z cycle, the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET offered
reasonable clustering within the ensemble spread to use as a
starting point. After next Wednesday, the GFS/ECMWF/Canadian had
some more favorable-than-not aspects over the CONUS, but each was
a bit removed from the good ensemble consensus to warrant a
lessening of their inputs. By next Fri, relied on an ensemble
blend along with the previous forecast which still fit well with
the ongoing thinking in a quasi-zonal/progressive pattern.

Trend has been toward a more defined upper system in the Northeast
(southeast Canada) next Tue on the heels of the departing sfc wave
through the northern Mid-Atlantic/Southern New England Mon.
Ensemble guidance has been mostly stable with the longwave pattern
by the end of next week, suggesting a coastal low off the NC coast
next Thu, but east-west differences in recent ECMWF/GEFS ensemble
runs persist.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Early next week expect a period of enhanced precipitation over the
central Rockies/High Plains from the combination of the upper
trough over the West and strong Plains high pressure leading to
low level upslope flow.  Accumulating snow is likely in the higher
terrain of Colorado and Wyoming while cold rain should fall in
lower elevations.  Otherwise much of the West should be fairly dry
through the period.

Moisture and southern stream shortwave energy along a front
settling toward the Gulf Coast may already support some areas of
moderate to heavy rainfall across the South to start the week.
Then the progression of the western upper trough may produce some
waviness along the front and intensify rainfall from parts of the
southern Plains through the Southeast.  Some areas across the
southern tier may be sensitive to this additional rainfall in
light of significant totals received over the past week, though at
least late this week into the weekend should be fairly dry over
the South.  Some of the southern tier moisture may extend farther
northward over the eastern U.S. mid-late week as potential low
pressure develops.

During Monday-Tuesday the temperatures over the central portions
of the High Plains/eastern slopes of the Rockies should be more
reminiscent of March, with highs up to 20-25F below early May
averages.  This region will see a steady warming trend after
Tuesday, possibly to the point of seeing highs 5-10F above normal
by next Friday.  Much of the central and eastern U.S. should see
multiple days with highs 5-15F below normal due to the influence
of an upper trough over the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48
during the first half of the week and Canadian high pressure
reaching areas to the east of the Rockies.  Meanwhile above
average temperatures will expand across the West as an upper ridge
progresses into and across the region.  The best potential of plus
10-20F anomalies for highs will be from parts of California and
Oregon into the Great Basin.  The Pacific Northwest may see a
cooling trend late next week with the arrival of an upper trough.

...Heavy rain possible over parts of the South early-mid week...

...Well below normal temperatures over the central-southern High
Plains with some snow in the central Rockies early next week...

...Overview...

Expect a moderately progressive upper pattern over the lower 48
during the period.  A Great Lakes/Northeast upper trough will
depart after midweek, followed by a trough emerging from the
Rockies and likely reaching near the East Coast by next Saturday.
A trailing upper ridge will cross the West mid-late week.  By
early next weekend the ridge is likely to be over the Plains while
an amplifying trough arrives at the West Coast.  Central
Rockies/High Plains precipitation associated with the initial
upper trough and low level upslope flow will be trending lighter
Tuesday but chilly temperatures will remain before a moderating
trend.  Progression of the upper trough and interaction with a
front over or just south of the Gulf Coast region should promote
rain/thunderstorms over the South with some heavy activity
possible.  Some of this moisture may extend farther
north/northeast after midweek.  The trailing upper ridge will
bring a brief period of warmth to the West followed by a return
back toward normal readings as the next upper trough reaches the
West Coast.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Most guidance has been finding a way to achieve a similar
trough-ridge-trough configuration for the upper pattern by the end
of the period next Saturday but the embedded details vary and
there is now more divergence for the eastern U.S./western Atlantic
surface pattern after midweek.

From the Rockies eastward, combined details of the departing
Northeast trough and specifics of the upstream trough emerging
from the Rockies differ enough to produce widely different
evolutions at the surface.  Latest Canadian runs have held onto
more southwestward elongation of the Northeast trough while the
12Z ECMWF significantly changed from its continuity in adjusting
to a faster/more sheared depiction of the Rockies shortwave.  In
both of these cases the result is much greater dominance of
surface high pressure over the eastern U.S./western Atlantic after
midweek--in contrast to recent ensemble mean consensus for a weak
wave to track near the Mid-Atlantic/New England coast.  On the
other side of the spectrum recent GFS runs have been the strongest
with this development and the new 00Z GFS/GEFS mean have adjusted
a little slower than the previous run and most other guidance.

Near the West Coast, there is still a period of time mid-late week
when models/ensembles suggest a very low-predictability regime
with small-scale shortwaves progressing from the Pacific into
western North America before upper troughing amplifies near the
coast.  Recent GFS runs have trended favorably slower toward
consensus for the late-period trough, and while guidance is split
over whether a compact upper low near the Alaska Peninsula as of
early Tuesday ultimately shears apart (GFS/UKMET) or remains
defined and becomes a component of the evolving trough
(ECMWF/CMC), the agreement of models/means for the trough in
principle provided some degree of confidence.  This is before
arrival of the new 00Z ECMWF which completely changes the pattern
by separating eastern Pacific flow.

The first priority of the forecast blend was to maintain some
reflection of an East Coast wave late in the week per continuity
and the means, so the late-period part of the blend incorporated
some 18Z GFS and old 00Z/07 ECMWF along with the 18Z GEFS/12Z
ECMWF means.  This provided a reasonable depiction of consensus
over the West while downplaying lower confidence specifics.  An
operational model composite (more weight of the last two ECMWF
runs and 18Z GFS relative to the 12Z UKMET/CMC) was reasonable
early in the period.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Precipitation over the central Rockies and High Plains should be
tapering off on Tuesday, with some high elevation snow still
possible.  Most of the West will be dry during the period though
the Northwest may begin to see scattered precipitation toward the
end of the week as the upper trough moves in.  Farther east, parts
of the South may see some heavy rainfall as the upper trough
progressing out of the Rockies interacts with a wavy front that
should be over or just south of the Gulf Coast region.  Compared
to yesterday there seems to be a little more uncertainty over
exactly where the highest rainfall totals will be.  The most
likely scenario of a frontal wave ultimately tracking near the
East Coast would spread rain of varying intensity northeastward
over the eastern U.S., but confidence in this evolution has
decreased somewhat.  Early in the period the upper trough and
surface system affecting the Northeast should produce mainly light
precipitation with a little snow possible in the highest
elevations.

Unseasonably cool temperatures will persist over the central
Rockies and parts of the central-southern Plains into Tuesday with
highs up to 20-25F below normal.  The southern half of the Plains
may still see highs 10-20F below normal on Wednesday but a quick
warm-up should bring highs up to 5-10F above normal over central
parts of the Plains Friday-Saturday.  Many other portions of the
central/eastern U.S. will likely see one or more days with
temperatures 5-15F below normal through Wednesday or Thursday,
followed by a moderating trend that should bring readings closer
to normal by Saturday.  Meanwhile continue to expect the main
emphasis for 10-20F above normal highs to progress from parts of
California and Oregon into the Great Basin during Tuesday-Friday.
The upper trough nearing the West Coast should bring readings back
toward normal over the West Coast states by Saturday.

Valid 081200Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A deep upper trough over the eastern CONUS is forecast to move
eastward today, as an upstream trough over the West shifts eastward
into portions of the Plains by tonight. A surface low is forecast to
deepen and move eastward across parts of the central/southern
Plains, while a surface ridge remains in place over the eastern
Pacific into the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin.

...Northern California...
A strengthening surface pressure gradient, in conjunction with
increasing deep-layer northwesterly flow, will result in the
development of strong northerly winds across portions of northern CA
this morning and continuing through the day, particularly in and
near the Sacramento Valley and into portions of the Bay Area. With
very warm and dry conditions expected, the increasing winds will
result in a critical fire weather threat. Critical conditions may
develop as soon as early/mid morning across terrain-favored areas,
and by late morning across much of the Sacramento Valley. Conditions
will likely peak this afternoon, with sustained winds of 20-25 mph
(with higher gusts) expected concurrent with minimum RH values of
5-15%. Critical conditions may persist through much of the evening,
with poor overnight RH recovery.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the primary surface low and attendant dryline moves east into the
southern Plains, widespread critical (and locally extreme)
meteorological conditions are expected to develop across much of NM
into west TX and the OK/TX Panhandles. During the peak of the event
this afternoon, sustained winds of 20-30 mph (with higher gusts) are
expected in conjunction with minimum RH values of 3-15%.

Fuels are not particularly favorable across the region, and some
areas received rainfall on Friday. While this will temper the threat
to some extent, the presence of high-end critical to locally extreme
wind/RH, along with the potential for holdover fires from lightning
activity on Friday, justifies maintaining a large critical
delineation for much of NM.

...Carolinas...
Relatively dry and breezy conditions are expected across northern
parts of SC into much of NC this afternoon. Sustained winds of 15-20
mph in conjunction with minimum RH values of 20-30% will result in
elevated meteorological conditions. While ERC values had been
running rather high across portions of NC, substantial rainfall over
the last couple of days casts doubt on fuel receptivity across the
region. No elevated delineation has been made at this time, but the
potential will be reassessed in the Day 1 update.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough is forecast to remain in place across much of
the CONUS on Sunday. A surface low is forecast to move quickly
eastward from the mid-MS Valley into the Mid Atlantic by late Sunday
night, as an attendant cold front sweeps through much of the
southern Plains into parts of the Southeast. Further west, a weak
surface low will remain in place across the Southwest, while a
surface ridge will persist from the eastern Pacific into portions of
the Northwest and Great Basin.

...Northern California...
A warm and dry northerly flow regime is forecast to persist across
northern CA on Sunday. While guidance currently suggests that winds
may be slightly weaker compared to D1/Saturday, critical conditions
are still expected to develop early in the day, as sustained winds
remain around 20 mph and RH quickly drops below critical thresholds
by late morning across much of the region after poor overnight
recovery.

...Southwest...
Dry and breezy conditions are again expected across parts of the
Southwest on Sunday, though winds are forecast to generally be
weaker compared to D1/Saturday. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph
(locally higher, with stronger gusts) are forecast from parts of
eastern AZ into the Four Corners region, New Mexico, and far west
TX, in conjunction with critically low RH during the afternoon.
These conditions will result in an elevated fire weather threat,
with some locally critical conditions possible.

...Parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas/Virginia...
Warmer conditions are expected across the Southeast into the Mid
Atlantic on Sunday, as low-level flow shifts to southerly across the
region. While a gradual increase in low-level moisture is expected,
RH values may still drop to near critical thresholds in some areas,
due to warmer temperatures and initially limited Gulf and Atlantic
moisture availability. Elevated meteorological conditions appear
possible across portions of the region, though uncertainty regarding
fuel receptivity precludes any highlights at this time.

...Severe weather and moderate to heavy rainfall potentially
causing flash flooding are forecast across portions of the Plains
and Mississippi and Ohio Valleys....

...Some late-season snowfall is expected across the Northern
Rockies to Northern High Plains...

...Colder than normal temperatures are likely in the northern
U.S., while warm and dry conditions will cause Critical Risks of
fire weather in California and New Mexico...

A strengthening low pressure and frontal system is expected to
move across the Central Plains today and toward the Ohio Valley by
Sunday. Widespread rain and thunderstorms are forecast in portions
of the central U.S. as abundant moisture flows into this system.
Today, severe thunderstorms are likely to focus in the Central
Plains, and a Slight Risk of severe weather is in place for
tornado, wind, and hail threats. Widespread rainfall amounts of 1
to 2 inches are forecast for parts of the Central Plains into the
Middle Mississippi Valley, and isolated to scattered flash floods
are possible. Then on Sunday, the associated cold front is
expected to shift southward, so storms will focus from the
Ark-La-Tex into the Mid-South, and Slight Risks of severe weather
and flash flooding are both in place there. Moderate to heavy rain
is also expected across the Ohio Valley on Sunday and Sunday night.

Farther west, snow is forecast in the Northern Rockies underneath
an upper-level low, which could accumulate to around a foot in the
highest elevations today through Monday morning. Snow is expected
to shift southward into the Central Rockies as well on Sunday
night. Additionally, late-season snow is possible in the Northern
High Plains particularly on Saturday night, with accumulations of
an inch or two possible.

In terms of temperatures, broad upper-level troughing will keep
temperatures well below normal from across the northern tier
states to much of the eastern U.S. today before a warm-up in the
Southeast to Carolinas on Sunday. Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories are in effect this morning for the Upper Great Lakes
region and into parts of the Ohio Valley with lows in the 30s. On
the other hand, temperatures will be quite warm across the
south-central U.S., rising into the 90s today over
southern/central portions of the High Plains. The cold front
should push the heat southward on Sunday, with temperatures in the
100s for South Texas. Warm and dry conditions in the
Southwest/Southern High Plains and also interior northern
California have prompted Elevated to Critical Risks of fire
weather as well as Red Flag Warnings in those areas.

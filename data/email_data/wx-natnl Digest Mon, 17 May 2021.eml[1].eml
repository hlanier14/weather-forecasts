..Bentley.. 05/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0123 AM CDT Sun May 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low embedded in a mid-level trough over
portions of California/Nevada will slowly shift east throughout the
day, sliding into portions of the lower Great Basin by the end of
the period. As this occurs, a broad region of marginally enhanced
southwesterly mid-level flow will overspread much of the Southwest
into the southern High Plains throughout the day. At the surface,
warm/dry conditions are expected to persist.

...Southwest into West Texas...
Diurnal heating/mixing processes will allow some of the marginally
enhanced mid-level flow to mix toward the surface, resulting in
sustained southwesterly winds of 10-15 mph. Meanwhile, RH values
should fall into the teens and single digits. Fuels across the
region remain at least marginally receptive to large-fire spread.
Thus elevated fire-weather conditions can be expected, with perhaps
some localized critical fire-weather conditions possible where winds
manage to be a bit stronger.

...Northern ND into northwest MN...
A surface low will track through south central portions of Canada
throughout the day, with southwesterly post-frontal surface flow
extending into northern portions of North Dakota into far northwest
Minnesota. RH values should fall into the teens to lower 20s, with
sustained winds of 10-15 mph. Locally elevated conditions can be
expected across this region, but such conditions appear too
localized to warrant any highlights at this time.

...Heavy rain threat for the southern Plains to the western Gulf
coast through midweek...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to depict a heavy rain event likely
to shift farther south toward the Texas Gulf Coast region on
Thursday.  There has been a consistent model signal for the
heaviest rain to fall across eastern Texas before diminishing
significantly on Friday.  Thereafter, another rainfall axis will
tend to set up closer toward the central and southern High Plains
by next weekend as a deep upper trough approaches from the
northwest.  Models have again trended toward configuring this deep
upper trough to be more positively-tilted as additional energy is
sent downstream across the northern tier states and southern
Canada.  Meanwhile for the northern Rockies to possibly the nearby
High Plains, there is increasing model support for sustaining a
late-season wet snow event from the middle of next week to next
weekend.  In contrast to the cold upper trough in the West, there
continues to be a trend toward modifying a cool high pressure
system near the East Coast to a warm deep layer anticyclone by
next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will likely sustain
a heavy rain event with focus across eastern Texas Wednesday into
Thursday before diminishing by Friday.  Another axis of enhanced
rainfall may then set up closer toward the central and southern
High Plains next weekend as a cold front associated a deep trough
moving through the western U.S.

Upslope flow across the northern Rockies combining with
upper-level divergence ahead of the upper trough will likely
sustain a wet snow event into next weekend for the higher
elevations and could extend into the High Plains especially during
the night.

Meanwhile, ridge amplification in the eastern U.S. will coincide
with substantial warming this week from the Midwest to the
especially the East where some record high minimum and maximum
values will be possible as temperature anomalies build upwards to
10-20F above normal.  Deep moisture and vorticity rotating around
the building upper ridge over the East will likely bring some
diurnally-driven downpours up into the northern Plains/upper
Midwest, parts of New England, and initially the Florida Keys.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest and Sierra through the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies, including some mountain enhanced
snows. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West, early
week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the Northwest
U.S. through the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool with
pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage that may
result in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

...Heavy rain threat for the southern Plains to the western Gulf
coast through midweek...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Models and ensembles continue to depict a heavy rain event likely
to shift farther south toward the Texas Gulf Coast region on
Thursday.  There has been a consistent model signal for the
heaviest rain to fall across eastern Texas before diminishing
significantly on Friday.  Thereafter, another rainfall axis will
tend to set up closer toward the central and southern High Plains
by next weekend as a deep upper trough approaches from the
northwest.  Models have again trended toward configuring this deep
upper trough to be more positively-tilted as additional energy is
sent downstream across the northern tier states and southern
Canada.  Meanwhile for the northern Rockies to possibly the nearby
High Plains, there is increasing model support for sustaining a
late-season wet snow event from the middle of next week to next
weekend.  In contrast to the cold upper trough in the West, there
continues to be a trend toward modifying a cool high pressure
system near the East Coast to a warm deep layer anticyclone by
next week.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  Good WPC
continuity was maintained.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Deep layered moisture from the Gulf of Mexico will likely sustain
a heavy rain event with focus across eastern Texas Wednesday into
Thursday before diminishing by Friday.  Another axis of enhanced
rainfall may then set up closer toward the central and southern
High Plains next weekend as a cold front associated a deep trough
moving through the western U.S.

Upslope flow across the northern Rockies combining with
upper-level divergence ahead of the upper trough will likely
sustain a wet snow event into next weekend for the higher
elevations and could extend into the High Plains especially during
the night.

Meanwhile, ridge amplification in the eastern U.S. will coincide
with substantial warming this week from the Midwest to the
especially the East where some record high minimum and maximum
values will be possible as temperature anomalies build upwards to
10-20F above normal.  Deep moisture and vorticity rotating around
the building upper ridge over the East will likely bring some
diurnally-driven downpours up into the northern Plains/upper
Midwest, parts of New England, and initially the Florida Keys.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest and Sierra through the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies, including some mountain enhanced
snows. Ahead of the Pacific front that moves into the West, early
week maximum temperatures 10-20F above normal from the Northwest
U.S. through the northern Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool with
pattern amplification and wavy cold frontal passage that may
result in 10-20F below normal temperatures centered across the
Intermountain West.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 16 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

...Severe thunderstorms likely across portions of the Central and
Southern Plains through Tuesday...

...Areas of flash flooding possible tonight and Monday across the
central and south-central United States, with a greater risk of
excessive rainfall on Tuesday from southeast Oklahoma to
north-central Texas...

The most important weather story over the next few days will
continue to be found across central and south-central sections of
the country, where continuing rounds of heavy rain and
thunderstorms will impact the region. The atmospheric ingredients
responsible for this weather pattern include a quasi-stationary
boundary that extends from the Central Rockies through the Central
Plains and into the Lower Ohio Valley. Meanwhile, an upper-level
low spinning above the Southwest will allow for replenishing
moisture from the western Gulf of Mexico to surge northward. A
dryline located across the southern High Plains will also help
spark thunderstorm activity. A few storms may turn severe tonight
and Monday across the central and Southern High Plains. The Storm
Prediction Center has issued a slight risk (level 2 of 5) of
severe weather for this evening across the aforementioned region,
with an enhanced risk (level 3 of 5) valid on Monday across
portions of the Texas Panhandle. Damaging wind gusts, large hail,
and isolated tornado are all a possibility. Additional rounds of
severe weather are possible across the Southern Plains on Tuesday.

Along with the threat of severe weather, heavy rain could pose a
significant threat of flash flooding by Tuesday after multiple
rounds of downpours tonight and Monday. WPC has issued a Slight
Risk of Excessive Rainfall through early Monday morning across
eastern Kansas and northern Missouri, south-central Oklahoma and
north-central Texas, as well as coastal sections of southeast
Texas. Multiple days of rainfall will likely lead to saturated
soils and conditions ripe for flash flooding. By Tuesday afternoon
and evening, an additional impulse of thunderstorms could dump
over three inches of rain from southeast Oklahoma to northeast and
north-central Texas. This amount of rain will likely lead to flash
flooding across this area. Therefore, WPC has issued a Moderate
Risk of Excessive Rainfall for Tuesday. Flash Flood Watches are
also in effect through Tuesday night.

Elsewhere, scattered showers and high elevation snow are possible
across the Pacific Northwest on Monday and Tuesday as a cold front
enters the region. Outside the Northwest, above average
temperatures will be found across the Northern Tier to start the
workweek. This will includes highs in the 70s and 80s stretching
from the Northern Rockies through the Upper Midwest and into New
England. For the Southwest, dry and windy conditions will continue
to lead to fire weather concerns. Wind Advisories are in effect
across interior southern California, with Red Flag Warnings found
across southern Utah and southeast Arizona.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0239 PM CDT Sun May 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

Expanded the elevated area across the southern High Plains slightly
farther northeast to account for the latest forecast positioning of
the cold front tomorrow.

In addition, added an elevated area for northeast Montana and
northern North Dakota. Strong lee cyclogenesis in Alberta will
strengthen the pressure gradient and surface winds across the
Canadian Prairies and the United States northern Plains. Drier
surface conditions are expected in Canada as low-level moisture
advects northward with the strengthening flow. However, significant
moisture is not expected to reach far northern North
Dakota/northeast Montana, where relative humidity of 20 to 25
percent is expected during the afternoon with sustained winds around
15 mph.

Some recent rainfall has improved fuel moisture in spots around the
region, but the rainfall was not widespread. Therefore, some areas
have seen very little rainfall recently, and breezy conditions today
will dry fine fuels.

..Bentley.. 05/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0124 AM CDT Sun May 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low positioned over portions of the lower Great
Basin will shift east slowly, while transitioning to more of an open
wave within the broader mid-level trough. The trough is forecast to
move into the four-corners region by the end of the forecast period,
which should shift much of the marginally enhanced southwesterly
mid-level flow, associated with the southern periphery of the
trough, into portions of northern Mexico and the southern High
Plains. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis will commence along the
southern High Plains, with a surface dry line extending into
portions of West/Southwest Texas.

...Southwest into West Texas...
Dry/breezy conditions will persist across a more confined region
compared to previous days, as the upper-level pattern begins to
shift eastward. Afternoon heating/mixing processes will result in
sustained southwesterly surface winds of 10-15 mph to develop while
RH values fall into the low teens and single digits amid
dry/receptive fuels. This will result in elevated fire-weather
conditions, with locally critical conditions possible where winds
end up a bit stronger, particularly if the surface pressure gradient
is enhanced by the developing surface cyclone. There remains some
uncertainty in the position and evolution of the dry line, and thus,
additional refinements to the eastern boundary of the elevated area
can be expected in later outlooks.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1258 AM CDT Mon May 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
A closed upper-level low positioned over the lower Great Basin
region will shift east throughout the day, into the lower Rockies by
the end of the period. Marginally enhanced mid-level flow will
accompany the southern periphery of the low/trough throughout this
progression, overspreading portions of the Southwest and southern
High Plains. Farther north, a mid-level trough will begin entering
portions of the Pacific Northwest. At the surface, lee cyclogenesis
will occur along the southern High Plains, with a dry line extending
south into the Big Bend region of West Texas. Likewise, a cold front
will enter portions of northern/western New Mexico throughout the
day.

...Southwest and West Texas...
A combination of diurnal heating/mixing processes west of the dry
line and a strengthening surface pressure gradient will result in
sustained surface wind speeds of 10-15 mph, with locally higher
gusts. Meanwhile, RH values should fall into the teens and single
digits amid widespread extreme/exceptional drought conditions. Fuel
receptivity decreases with eastern extent across the area, however,
the wind/RH combo may be a bit stronger in areas immediately behind
the dry line across eastern New Mexico and far West Texas. Thus,
elevated fire-weather conditions can be expected, with localized
critical conditions possible.

...Northeast Montana and Northern North Dakota...
Warm/dry conditions are expected across the region, with southerly
sustained winds of 10-15 mph, gusting into the 20s mph, as a surface
low strengthens across south-central Canada. Widespread drought
conditions are present, and fuels remain at least marginally
receptive to large-fire spread despite some recent wetting rains in
isolated areas. RH values should fall into low to mid 20s during the
afternoon, supporting elevated fire-weather conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1259 AM CDT Mon May 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level closed low over the lower Rockies will transition to an
open wave, resulting in a relaxing height gradient, as it merges
with a mid-level trough entering portions of the Pacific Northwest.
Consequently, mid-level flow over portions of the Southwest and
southern High Plains will decrease in magnitude as compared to
previous days. With a lack of appreciable mid-level flow, surface
winds are expected to become more light and variable, despite
ambient dry conditions prevailing across parts of the Southwest and
southern High Plains. Thus, fire-weather concerns remain low.

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers to
mid-later week...
...Hot for the East-Central U.S. and Cold/Unsettled over the
West/Rockies...

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the well clustered 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and 12
UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend
of Models, with a larger focus on the more run to run consistent
ensemble means by days 6/7. This maintains good WPC continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Models and ensembles still agree that upper flow pattern over the
lower 48 states will significantly amplify over the next few days.
The upper pattern will be highlighted into midweek by an emerging
digging trough into the West and troughing over the south-central
Plains increasingly blocked by an amplified and warming ridge
building out from the East. Ridge amplification will coincide with
substantial warming this week from the Midwest to the especially
the East where some record high minimum and maximum values will be
possible as temperature anomalies build upwards to 10-20F above
normal.

An ongoing but transitional heavy rainfall event should persist
through mid-late week with continued but slowly diminishing focus
over the southern Plains. WPC QPF has this trend, but blocky flow
and deep pooled Gulf moisture suggests some downpours may produce
more hefty local amounts and runoff issues.

Mid-later next week digging of amplified upper troughing over the
West will support widespread moderate precipitation from the
Pacific Northwest and Sierra through the north-central
Intermountain West/Rockies, including some mountain enhanced snows
to focus over the Northern Rockies. Ahead of the Pacific front
that moves into the West, early week maximum temperatures 10-20F
above normal from the Northwest U.S. through the northern
Rockies/Plains will abruptly cool with pattern amplification and
wavy cold frontal passage that may result in 10-20F below normal
temperatures centered across the Intermountain West.

Ejecting western trough impulses and some energy from the southern
Plains will shear northward over the central U.S. on the western
periphery of an anchoring east-central ridge. This conduit will
supports period of enhanced convective rains as moisture and
instability focus along a slow moving and wavy from over the
north-central U.S..

...Southern Plains Heavy Rain/Convection Threat lingers to

...Hot for the East-Central U.S. and Cold/Unsettled over the

...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

The WPC medium range product was primarily derived days 3-5
(Thu-Sat) from a composite blend of reasonably well clustered
guidance from the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS mean and 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF
ensemble mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models in a
pattern with above normal predictability. Opted for a larger focus
on the more run to run consistent ensemble means by days 6/7 amid
slowly growing forecast spread/uncertainty. This maintains good
WPC continuity. The OO UTC models are more in line days 6/7 as the
GFS/ECMWF now better align with holding onto ample western U.S.
upper troughing longer than their 12/18 UTC runs. This better
matches the ensemble means and this latter period trend seems
reasonable considering flow amplification.

...There is a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
Southern Plains...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central High Plains and the Central Gulf Coast...

A quasi-stationary front extends from the Middle
Mississippi/Western Ohio Valleys westward to the Central/Southern
High Plains, then into the Great Basin through Wednesday morning.
A dryline will develop over parts of the Southern High Plains,
making a daily oscillation eastward. Moisture from the Western
Gulf of Mexico will stream northward over the Plains and the
Mississippi Valley that will help produce showers and
thunderstorms over parts of the Central/Southern Plains and
Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley through Wednesday. The SPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
Southern Plains through Tuesday morning.  The main threats from
the severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Additionally,
there is a 10% or greater probability of two-inch or greater hail
over the Southern High Plains.

The WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts
of the Central High Plains and the Central Gulf Coast through
Tuesday morning. The heavy rain associated with the thunderstorms
will produce localized areas of flash flooding.  The most
vulnerable areas to the heavy rain are urban areas, roads, and
small streams.  Showers and thunderstorms will also develop over
parts of the Ohio Valley into the Central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic on Monday. On Tuesday, the severe
thunderstorm threat and the excessive rainfall threat will
continue over the Southern Plains into parts of the Lower
Mississippi Valley. Rain will develop over parts of the Upper
Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes into Wednesday morning.

Meanwhile, overnight Monday, a front will move onshore over the
Pacific Northwest, moving inland to the Northern Plains to the
Great Basin/Southern California by Wednesday.  Light rain will
develop over the Northwest with wet snow at the highest elevations
through Wednesday morning.  Elsewhere, light rain with embedded
thunderstorms will develop over parts of the Northeast through
late Tuesday evening. Easterly flow off the Atlantic will aid in
producing showers and thunderstorms over the east coast of Florida
on Tuesday into Wednesday.

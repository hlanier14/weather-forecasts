Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1157 AM CDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 261700Z - 271200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE NORTHERN TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO
PARTS OF WESTERN KANSAS AND FAR SOUTH-CENTRAL NEBRASKA....

Expanded the Elevated and Critical areas northeast across the
central Plains based on 12Z guidance showing 20+ mph winds extending
into central Nebraska. No additional changes were necessary.

..Bentley.. 04/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CDT Tue Apr 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale ridge and modest midlevel westerly flow will cross the
Rockies, while surface high pressure moves eastward from the central
Plains into the Middle MS Valley. As a result, dry/breezy southerly
return flow will become established across the central and southern
High Plains -- where critically dry fuels exist.

...Central and Southern High Plains...
Southerly return flow will strengthen across the central and
southern High Plains, though boundary-layer moisture will generally
remain limited. Downslope warming/drying combined with diurnal
heating of a dry antecedent airmass will result in 15-20 percent
minimum RH. The warm/dry boundary-layer conditions coupled with
20-30 mph sustained southerly surface winds (gusts upwards of 40
mph) will support enhanced fire-weather conditions. The best overlap
of strong/gusty surface winds and low RH will develop from the
northern TX Panhandle northeastward into parts of western KS --
where Critical highlights remain in place. Very dry fuels (90th+
percentile ERCs) across this region will further exacerbate the
wildfire-spread threat.

Farther west, enhanced fire-weather conditions will also be possible
in the San Luis Valley, however, these conditions are too localized
for highlights.

***Heavy rainfall becoming more likely for portions of the
Northern Plains for the end of the week***

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance initially has an excellent
depiction on the large scale pattern across the nation, with a
multi-deterministic model blend working well as a starting point
in the forecast process for Friday and into early Saturday.  By
the weekend, some timing and amplitude differences emerge with the
Pacific Northwest system moving inland across the Rockies, with
the CMC a bit slower and the GFS a bit faster than the consensus.
For the low pressure system and front reaching the West Coast
early next week, the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS are generally similar with
its progression across the Intermountain West, whereas the
GFS/GEFS is faster and the GFS loses ensemble support by next
Tuesday.  Therefore, there was a gradual increase in use of the
ensemble means for the second half of the forecast period, and
also maintained some previous WPC continuity.  In terms of
excessive rainfall, a small Slight Risk area was added to the
experimental Day 4 outlook across portions of central South Dakota
and south-central North Dakota to account for a better model
signal for 1-2+ inch rainfall totals over relatively saturated
ground conditions from previous heavy precipitation events.  The
previous forecast discussion follows below. /Hamrick
----------------------

...Overview...

An upper trough with its axis over the Intermountain West as the
medium range period begins Friday will push eastward into the
north-central U.S. through the weekend as it forms a closed upper
low. A surface low is likely to consolidate in conjunction with
the trough/low, spreading rain to much of the central U.S. while
snow is forecast on the backside of the low across the northern
Rockies with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains as well, although the details of
precipitation amounts and placement remain uncertain at this
point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will move slowly away
from the Northeast over the weekend after spreading some light to
moderate rain and snow across the area for the latter part of the
week. Periodic unsettled weather is expected in the West as a
series of upper troughs and frontal systems move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a low pressure
system (both in the upper levels and at the surface) moving slowly
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. Additionally,
models have generally converged on a solution with a trough
initially across the Intermountain West developing into a closed
low as it moves over the central/northern Plains and Midwest over
the weekend, but with still some slight wiggles in latitudinal
position. The associated surface low track is fairly agreeable as
well, with the ECMWF perhaps on the western side and GFS runs on
the southeastern side of the spread in terms of the 12/18Z cycle,
but within typical medium range spread. The newer 00Z ECWMF and
GFS show good clustering with the low through at least Sunday.
There is also better consensus in recent guidance for the upper
low to weaken and lift into Canada early next week. The early part
of the WPC forecast was based mainly on a blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET.

Upstream, most guidance has an additional trough/low approaching
and entering the Northwest over the weekend. The major outlier
with this feature was the 12Z CMC, which has a much weaker
shortwave and thus by around Sunday-Monday produces a pattern
rather out of phase with other guidance, with strong ridging in
the West. The newer 00Z CMC came in closer to consensus with this
feature. But deterministic models as well as ensemble members show
differences in handling that shortwave Monday and beyond as well
as what could be strong energy coming in behind it. Thus the WPC
forecast phased in the ensemble means by the latter part of the
forecast period given the differences, particularly favoring the
12Z EC and CMC ensemble means that were pretty agreeable with a
slightly slower trough in the West compared to the GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The surface low pressure system will spread precipitation across
much of the central U.S. late this week that should spread into
the East over the weekend. Precipitation totals are likely to be
enhanced across northern/central parts of the Plains near the
consolidating surface low. Conditions will likely be cold enough
for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the low, and
there is once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading
into the northern High Plains as well. In portions of the Dakotas,
precipitation may begin as rain and transition to mixed
precipitation or snow, though details of these threats remain
somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become heavy to
locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for the latter part of this week.
Precipitation chances are expected to spread eastward into early
next week as the low slowly moves east, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Elsewhere, rounds of
light to moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and
rain in the lower elevations) are forecast across the Northwest as
a series of fronts cross the region along with upper-level energy.
The Northeast could see lingering precipitation late this week
before the coastal surface low and upper low pull away.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The northeastern quadrant of the
country can expect below average temperatures by 5-15F on Friday
but moderating near normal by early next week. Highs will remain
colder than normal by around 15-25F across the north-central U.S.
underneath upper troughing. Meanwhile, the central/southern High
Plains should see warmer than normal temperatures by up to 20F on
Friday before the upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed
over the weekend. Slightly above normal temperatures should then
stretch across much of the southern tier.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 26 2022

SYNOPSIS: During early week-2, there is considerable disagreement among the
dynamical models in regards to the mid-level height pattern contributing to
uncertainty and precluding the issuance of temperature related hazards over
the
Lower 48 in the outlook. Surface low formation favored over the Great Plains
increases the risk for heavy precipitation across portions of the Great
Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys during the first few days of the
period. Over Alaska, prevailing southerly flow is favored to bring above-
normal
temperatures throughout much of the Mainland, which may lead to localized
flooding during the ongoing ice river breakup season across the state.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Great Plains,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and Great Lakes, Wed-Thu, May 4-5.

Slight risk of high winds across the Great Plains, Wed-Fri, May 4-6.

Flooding possible along the Red River of the North.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY APRIL 29 - TUESDAY MAY 03:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!7Lxls1RaUE2rAXmijdFSdNHnatD0G_MwCHrRhNv4mMAFWKeIxW6ULGJXtvIdIY9M6Epqi5tVyO_vTmkIObUUm_gt3Ko$

FOR WEDNESDAY MAY 04 - TUESDAY MAY 10: By the middle of next week, there is
considerable disagreement between the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensemble forecasts
of the mean 500-hPa height pattern over the CONUS, contributing to added
uncertainty in today's hazard outlook. Compared to yesterday, the ECMWF
features more troughing over the western CONUS and stronger ridging downstream
over the central and eastern CONUS at the start of the period. Conversely, the
GEFS maintains a large coverage of positive mid-level height departures
throughout western North America during this time, with continued signs of
mid-level trough development over the eastern CONUS towards the middle of the
period. This juxtaposition results in conflicting temperature perspectives in
the ensemble guidance particularly across the western CONUS through day 10
(May
6), with dynamical models coming into somewhat better agreement with the
mid-level pattern thereafter.



The latest reforecast guidance offers little coherence in regards to hazardous
temperature potential, with the one exception being across the southern tier
of
the CONUS where above-normal temperatures are predominantly favored by both
the
GEFS and ECMWF during week-2. Here, there is some agreement between the
reforecast tools over the Southern Plains with at least a 20% chance of
maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 90 degrees F during the middle
of the period. However, this is less supported by uncalibrated temperature
guidance resulting in the removal of the slight risk of much above-normal
temperatures over the region. Tied to the aforementioned troughing aloft
favored by the GEFS over the eastern CONUS, the GEFS reforecast tool continues
to depict increased chances for minimum temperatures falling below the 15th
percentile to potentially affect emerging spring vegetation. However, the
ECMWF
ensemble maintains a more northeasterly mean solution of this mid-level
feature
by the middle of the period, translating into little to no cold signal in the
ECMWF reforecast tool over the CONUS. In the absence of a strongly amplified
troughing pattern east of the Rockies during this time of year, the prospect
of
hazardous cold and subfreezing minimum temperatures increasingly diminishes
given higher sun angles and warming climatology heading further into May.



At the surface, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles continue to feature surface
low development over the Great Plains early in the period. Compared to
yesterday, the 0z GEFS features higher spread among the ensemble members and
lesser mean precipitation amounts in the warm sector associated with this
surface feature. The 0z ECMWF remains more bullish than the GEFS, where
today's
uncalibrated guidance favors a deeper low and much of the heavy precipitation
potential expanding throughout the Midwest and eastern Plains, which is also
reflected in the ECMWF reforecast tool. Given better run-to-run continuity,
and
higher historical skill in the ECMWF precipitation guidance than the GEFS over
this portion of the country, a slight risk of heavy precipitation remains
posted for May 4-5 and is expanded farther to the north and west relative to
yesterday's outlook. A flooding possible hazard is also posted for many areas
surrounding the Red River of the North where there is ongoing snow melt and
flooding, and above-average precipitation favored during the next two weeks is
likely to worsen already saturated ground conditions over the region. Some
locations along the Red River are forecast to approach record flood stage
during week-1. In addition, the potential for a deepening surface low in the
Great Plains supports the continuation of a slight risk of high winds (May 4-
6)
 where the ECMWF reforecast tool maintains a broad region with at least a 20%
chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 20mph. The combination
of potentially high winds, as well as above (below)-normal temperatures
(precipitation) favored during week-2 is likely to worsen drought conditions
and enhance the risk of wildfires throughout the Central and Southern High
Plains.



Over Alaska, there is good model agreement favoring mid-level troughing over
the Aleutians where the prevailing southerly flow is expected to keep much of
the Mainland on the warm and wet side during the period. As many rivers are
experiencing their seasonal ice break up during early May, the favored warmer
than normal temperatures may accelerate snow and ice melt and raises concern
for river flooding and ice jams during the period. For precipitation,
reforecast tools also show increased chances for 3-day precipitation amounts
also exceeding the 85th percentile across the Southeast associated with the
forecast onshore flow, however actual totals are not expected to reach hazard
thresholds resulting in no corresponding hazards.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue April 26 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 02 - 06 2022

Model solutions are in good agreement with anomalous 500-hPa troughing over
Alaska and also offshore of the northeastern CONUS. Mean 500-hPa heights for
this 5-day period are near or slightly above average throughout the CONUS.
Given the likelihood of a negative Arctic Oscillation (AO) at the beginning of
May, a temperature composite of a negative AO during La Nina was used as
guidance. Above-normal temperatures are favored for the southern tier of the
CONUS, along and south of the 40th parallel. The largest probabilities of
above
normal temperatures are forecast for the Gulf Coast States and Southeast where
maximum temperature anomalies are likely to be 5 to 10 degrees F above normal
on days 6 and 7. Conversely, anomalous cold is forecast to be greatest in
magnitude across the north-central CONUS where below-normal temperatures are
favored. Probabilities for below-normal temperatures are slightly elevated for
the Pacific Northwest and northern California as at least one shortwave trough
is expected to cross these areas. Near normal temperatures are more likely for
the Northeast due to a variable temperature pattern during this 5-day period.

The precipitation tools are in good agreement spatially and imply an active
pattern for the CONUS as multiple low pressure systems are likely to affect a
majority of the lower 48. This pattern and good continuity favor above-normal
precipitation for most of the CONUS with the exception of the Southwest where
below-normal precipitation is more likely. The largest probabilities for
above-normal precipitation are forecast for parts of the north-central Great
Plains and Corn Belt, based on the mean 5-day storm track and a predicted
stationary front.

Anomalous troughing and enhanced onshore flow elevate probabilities for above
normal precipitation throughout nearly all of Alaska. Below normal 500-hPa
heights along with periods of precipitation also favor below-normal
temperatures for the Alaska Panhandle and parts of southeastern Mainland
Alaska. Despite below-normal 500-hPa heights throughout Alaska, reforecast
temperature tools remain in good agreement for increased probabilities of
above-normal temperatures across western and northern Mainland Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 50% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the precipitation tools offset by differences in the
temperature tools for parts of the CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 04 - 10 2022

The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means remain in good agreement with the 500-hPa
longwave pattern at the higher latitudes of North America. These model
solutions depict a trough over Alaska and the northern Pacific, ridging across
the Canadian Prairies, and a trough over eastern Canada and  the northeastern
CONUS. Later in week-2, daily ensemble means feature a weakening
(strengthening) of the 500-hPa troughs over Alaska (northeastern CONUS). A
potential culprit in the predictability for the week-2 temperature and
precipitation outlooks is if a shortwave trough separates from the mid-
latitude
westerlies and becomes a cut-off 500-hPa low. At this time, there is no
multi-model support for this outcome but this will be closely monitored during
the next few days. Reforecast temperature tools have trended slightly warmer
today across the north-central CONUS during week-2, but below-normal
temperatures remain favored for the Great Lakes to the west of a longwave
trough axis. Due to the absence of any predicted cold air advection and above
normal 500-hPa heights, increased probabilities for above-normal temperatures
are forecast from the southern Great Plains eastward to the Southeast.
Predicted periods of precipitation and increased likelihood of enhanced
cloudiness with onshore flow slightly favor below normal temperatures across
the Pacific Northwest and northern California.

The GEFS reforecast precipitation tool has trended drier today overall, but
the
wetter ECMWF reforecast precipitation tool was preferred due to the amplified
500-hPa trough upstream and its better skill recently. This anomalous
troughing
upstream over the northeastern Pacific is likely to promote enhanced Pacific
flow and the development of low pressure systems downstream over the central
CONUS with a subsequent track eastward. Therefore, a majority of the CONUS is
more likely to experience wetter-than-normal conditions. Based on the ECMWF
reforecast tool, slightly larger probabilities for above-normal precipitation
are forecast across the Great Basin, northern Rockies, and northern Great
Plains. Precipitation tools are in good agreement for elevated probabilities
for below normal precipitation across the Four Corners region but the Desert
Southwest was not included due to its dry climatology.

The 500-hPa height pattern over the northern Pacific and Alaska is quite
persistent from the 6-10 to 8-14 day period, although the anomalous troughing
may begin to weaken late in week-2. The enhanced onshore flow is likely to
promote a relatively wet pattern for much of Alaska during early May.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 50% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
differences in the GEFS and ECMWF precipitation tools and  concern for the
potential of the development of a cut-off low.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference in
the climate outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0246 PM CDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 271200Z - 281200Z

Expanded the Elevated area northeastward to include portions of the
central High Plains based on a forecast of 15 to 20 mph winds and
relative humidity of 15 to 25 percent. Additionally, dry
thunderstorms are expected with gusty outflow winds possible which
could also lead to greater fire-weather concerns.

High-based thunderstorms are likely across portions of the central
and southern High Plains where moisture will be limited (PWAT around
0.5 to 0.6 inches). Very dry fuels remain in this region, and
therefore, new lightning starts are possible.

..Bentley.. 04/26/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Apr 26 2022/

...Synopsis...
A deamplifying shortwave trough and enhanced west-southwesterly flow
aloft will overspread the Southwest, encouraging the development of
a diffuse dryline over eastern NM.

...Southwest...
Above average temperatures across the Southwest (behind the dryline)
will favor deep boundary-layer mixing into the enhanced
west-southwesterly flow aloft. As a result, minimum RH will drop
into the single digits to lower/middle teens amid sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph. These conditions,
combined with modestly receptive fuels across the region will lead
to elevated fire-weather conditions across portions of eastern AZ
into western NM. Any localized critical conditions that develop
should be confined to terrain-favored areas -- precluding the
introduction of Critical highlights.

While enhanced fire-weather conditions may briefly develop over
parts of northern NM into southern CO (particularly the San Luis
Valley), the localized nature of these conditions coupled with light
rainfall casts uncertainty on the overall fire-weather threat.
Therefore, no highlights have been added here, though trends will be
monitored.

...Showers and thunderstorms continue along the East Coast and
South Texas today near a progressing cold front...

...Developing coastal low to impact New England with rain and
higher elevation snow beginning tonight...

...Well below average temperatures forecast between the northern
Plains and Northeast over the next several days...

Unsettled weather is forecast to continue sliding eastward today
along a cold front currently stretching from the Interior
Northeast to the central Gulf Coast and South Texas. The cold
front is expected to reach off the East Coast by Tuesday night,
but linger near far southern Texas. As it does so, a few
developing thunderstorms could turn severe across the Southeast
and southern Mid-Atlantic. The Storm Prediction center has issued
a targeted Slight Risk (level 2/5) of severe thunderstorms from
portions over southeastern Virginia, with a Marginal Risk (level
1/5) extending into eastern Georgia. Thunderstorms here may
produce isolated damaging wind gusts and some hail into early this
evening, especially within the Severe Thunderstorm Watch in
southeast Virginia. Slow-moving thunderstorms may also lead to
isolated instances of flash flooding throughout far southern
Texas, where a Marginal Risk (level 1/4) of excessive rainfall is
in effect.

By tonight, an area of low pressure forming along the
aforementioned cold front is forecast to strengthen and swing
northeast toward coastal New England. Areas of light-to-moderate
rainfall will impact parts of southern New England into early
Wednesday morning as a result. The low pressure system is then
expected to reduce forward motion and occlude near the Gulf of
Maine, while continuing to strengthen as a closed upper-level low
approaches from the west. Widespread showers will overspread
northern New England, with rain changing to snow across the higher
terrain and parts of northern Maine and New Hampshire. The
greatest snowfall amounts through Thursday (up to around 4-6
inches) is most likely to occur across northern Maine and New
Hampshire. Limited overall impacts are anticipated from this
wintry activity, per the WPC WSSI.

Elsewhere, relatively light precipitation will be found across the
northern Great Basin and northern Rockies today as a weak cold
front traverses the region. For the central U.S., active weather
returns along a stationary front on Wednesday with the threat of
isolated severe thunderstorms and flash floods. A Marginal Risk of
severe weather exists from western Kansas to the southern High
Plains, where isolated damaging wind gusts and large hail are the
primary severe threats. A few instances of flash flooding cannot
be ruled out farther northeast from eastern Kansas to far western
Missouri as slow-moving thunderstorms develop over the region
Wednesday night. The isolated threat of flash flooding will also
linger into Thursday across similar areas due unsettled weather
remaining near the meandering frontal boundary extending across
the Mid-Mississippi Valley into the central Plains. In the
meantime, fire weather remains a concern over portions of the
central/southern Plains, where a Critical (level 2/3) fire weather
area is highlighted today by SPC. Conditions for favorable fire
activity are also noted over the southern Plains in the medium
range forecast, which will need monitored going into this week.

Temperatures through Thursday will remain below average across the
northern Plains, Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast as the
previously mentioned low pressure system near Maine and strong
high pressure building into the Upper Great Lakes provides
continuous chilly northwest winds. Highs will struggle to reach
above freezing today from northern North Dakota to the U.P. of
Michigan. This equates to around 25 degrees below average. A few
daily low temperature records could fall across the Midwest and
Great Lakes Wednesday morning. The frost/freeze threat will
gradually shift eastward on Wednesday and Thursday, spreading into
the Ohio Valley and northern Mid-Atlantic, where a widespread area
of Freeze Warnings, Freeze Watches, and Frost Advisories are in
effect through Wednesday/Thursday morning. Conversely, above
average temperatures will hang on for one more day across the
southern Mid-Atlantic ahead of the approaching cold front. Warm
temperatures underneath a building upper-level ridge will spread
from the Southwest to the central Plains by midweek, where highs
could reach into 80s and low 90s.

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022 - 12Z Tue May 03 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance initially has an excellent
depiction on the large scale pattern across the nation, with a
multi-deterministic model blend working well as a starting point
in the forecast process for Friday and into early Saturday.  By
the weekend, some timing and amplitude differences emerge with the
Pacific Northwest system moving inland across the Rockies, with
the CMC a bit slower and the GFS a bit faster than the consensus.
For the low pressure system and front reaching the West Coast
early next week, the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS are generally similar with
its progression across the Intermountain West, whereas the
GFS/GEFS is faster and the GFS loses ensemble support by next
Tuesday.  Therefore, there was a gradual increase in use of the
ensemble means for the second half of the forecast period, and
also maintained some previous WPC continuity.  In terms of
excessive rainfall, a small Slight Risk area was added to the
experimental Day 4 outlook across portions of central South Dakota
and south-central North Dakota to account for a better model
signal for 1-2+ inch rainfall totals over relatively saturated
ground conditions.  The previous forecast discussion follows
below. /Hamrick

...Overview...

An upper trough with its axis over the Intermountain West as the
medium range period begins Friday will push eastward into the
north-central U.S. through the weekend as it forms a closed upper
low. A surface low is likely to consolidate in conjunction with
the trough/low, spreading rain to much of the central U.S. while
snow is forecast on the backside of the low across the northern
Rockies with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains as well, although the details of
precipitation amounts and placement remain uncertain at this
point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will move slowly away
from the Northeast over the weekend after spreading some light to
moderate rain and snow across the area for the latter part of the
week. Periodic unsettled weather is expected in the West as a
series of upper troughs and frontal systems move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a low pressure
system (both in the upper levels and at the surface) moving slowly
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. Additionally,
models have generally converged on a solution with a trough
initially across the Intermountain West developing into a closed
low as it moves over the central/northern Plains and Midwest over
the weekend, but with still some slight wiggles in latitudinal
position. The associated surface low track is fairly agreeable as
well, with the ECMWF perhaps on the western side and GFS runs on
the southeastern side of the spread in terms of the 12/18Z cycle,
but within typical medium range spread. The newer 00Z ECWMF and
GFS show good clustering with the low through at least Sunday.
There is also better consensus in recent guidance for the upper
low to weaken and lift into Canada early next week. The early part
of the WPC forecast was based mainly on a blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET.

Upstream, most guidance has an additional trough/low approaching
and entering the Northwest over the weekend. The major outlier
with this feature was the 12Z CMC, which has a much weaker
shortwave and thus by around Sunday-Monday produces a pattern
rather out of phase with other guidance, with strong ridging in
the West. The newer 00Z CMC came in closer to consensus with this
feature. But deterministic models as well as ensemble members show
differences in handling that shortwave Monday and beyond as well
as what could be strong energy coming in behind it. Thus the WPC
forecast phased in the ensemble means by the latter part of the
forecast period given the differences, particularly favoring the
12Z EC and CMC ensemble means that were pretty agreeable with a
slightly slower trough in the West compared to the GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The surface low pressure system will spread precipitation across
much of the central U.S. late this week that should spread into
the East over the weekend. Precipitation totals are likely to be
enhanced across northern/central parts of the Plains near the
consolidating surface low. Conditions will likely be cold enough
for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the low, and
there is once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading
into the northern High Plains as well. In portions of the Dakotas,
precipitation may begin as rain and transition to mixed
precipitation or snow, though details of these threats remain
somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become heavy to
locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for the latter part of this week.
Precipitation chances are expected to spread eastward into early
next week as the low slowly moves east, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Elsewhere, rounds of
light to moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and
rain in the lower elevations) are forecast across the Northwest as
a series of fronts cross the region along with upper-level energy.
The Northeast could see lingering precipitation late this week
before the coastal surface low and upper low pull away.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The northeastern quadrant of the
country can expect below average temperatures by 5-15F on Friday
but moderating near normal by early next week. Highs will remain
colder than normal by around 15-25F across the north-central U.S.
underneath upper troughing. Meanwhile, the central/southern High
Plains should see warmer than normal temperatures by up to 20F on
Friday before the upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed
over the weekend. Slightly above normal temperatures should then
stretch across much of the southern tier.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
419 PM EDT Tue Apr 26 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Apr 29 2022 - 12Z Tue May 03 2022

18Z Update:  The 12Z model guidance initially has an excellent
depiction on the large scale pattern across the nation, with a
multi-deterministic model blend working well as a starting point
in the forecast process for Friday and into early Saturday.  By
the weekend, some timing and amplitude differences emerge with the
Pacific Northwest system moving inland across the Rockies, with
the CMC a bit slower and the GFS a bit faster than the consensus.
For the low pressure system and front reaching the West Coast
early next week, the CMC/ECMWF/ECENS are generally similar with
its progression across the Intermountain West, whereas the
GFS/GEFS is faster and the GFS loses ensemble support by next
Tuesday.  Therefore, there was a gradual increase in use of the
ensemble means for the second half of the forecast period, and
also maintained some previous WPC continuity.  In terms of
excessive rainfall, a small Slight Risk area was added to the
experimental Day 4 outlook across portions of central South Dakota
and south-central North Dakota to account for a better model
signal for 1-2+ inch rainfall totals over relatively saturated
ground conditions.  The previous forecast discussion follows
below. /Hamrick

...Overview...

An upper trough with its axis over the Intermountain West as the
medium range period begins Friday will push eastward into the
north-central U.S. through the weekend as it forms a closed upper
low. A surface low is likely to consolidate in conjunction with
the trough/low, spreading rain to much of the central U.S. while
snow is forecast on the backside of the low across the northern
Rockies with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains as well, although the details of
precipitation amounts and placement remain uncertain at this
point. Meanwhile, surface and upper lows will move slowly away
from the Northeast over the weekend after spreading some light to
moderate rain and snow across the area for the latter part of the
week. Periodic unsettled weather is expected in the West as a
series of upper troughs and frontal systems move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Model guidance remains quite agreeable in keeping a low pressure
system (both in the upper levels and at the surface) moving slowly
over the Canadian Maritimes through the weekend. Additionally,
models have generally converged on a solution with a trough
initially across the Intermountain West developing into a closed
low as it moves over the central/northern Plains and Midwest over
the weekend, but with still some slight wiggles in latitudinal
position. The associated surface low track is fairly agreeable as
well, with the ECMWF perhaps on the western side and GFS runs on
the southeastern side of the spread in terms of the 12/18Z cycle,
but within typical medium range spread. The newer 00Z ECWMF and
GFS show good clustering with the low through at least Sunday.
There is also better consensus in recent guidance for the upper
low to weaken and lift into Canada early next week. The early part
of the WPC forecast was based mainly on a blend of the 18Z GFS and
12Z ECMWF and UKMET.

Upstream, most guidance has an additional trough/low approaching
and entering the Northwest over the weekend. The major outlier
with this feature was the 12Z CMC, which has a much weaker
shortwave and thus by around Sunday-Monday produces a pattern
rather out of phase with other guidance, with strong ridging in
the West. The newer 00Z CMC came in closer to consensus with this
feature. But deterministic models as well as ensemble members show
differences in handling that shortwave Monday and beyond as well
as what could be strong energy coming in behind it. Thus the WPC
forecast phased in the ensemble means by the latter part of the
forecast period given the differences, particularly favoring the
12Z EC and CMC ensemble means that were pretty agreeable with a
slightly slower trough in the West compared to the GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The surface low pressure system will spread precipitation across
much of the central U.S. late this week that should spread into
the East over the weekend. Precipitation totals are likely to be
enhanced across northern/central parts of the Plains near the
consolidating surface low. Conditions will likely be cold enough
for snow in the northern Rockies on the backside of the low, and
there is once again some threat of wintry precipitation spreading
into the northern High Plains as well. In portions of the Dakotas,
precipitation may begin as rain and transition to mixed
precipitation or snow, though details of these threats remain
somewhat uncertain. Additionally, rain could become heavy to
locally excessive from parts of the Plains into the
Mississippi/Ohio Valleys for the latter part of this week.
Precipitation chances are expected to spread eastward into early
next week as the low slowly moves east, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Elsewhere, rounds of
light to moderate precipitation (snow in the higher elevations and
rain in the lower elevations) are forecast across the Northwest as
a series of fronts cross the region along with upper-level energy.
The Northeast could see lingering precipitation late this week
before the coastal surface low and upper low pull away.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The northeastern quadrant of the
country can expect below average temperatures by 5-15F on Friday
but moderating near normal by early next week. Highs will remain
colder than normal by around 15-25F across the north-central U.S.
underneath upper troughing. Meanwhile, the central/southern High
Plains should see warmer than normal temperatures by up to 20F on
Friday before the upper ridge promoting the warmth is suppressed
over the weekend. Slightly above normal temperatures should then
stretch across much of the southern tier.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF NORTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO
AND NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel shortwave trough will deamplify as it tracks
northeastward across the Southwest. Enhanced west-southwesterly
midlevel flow accompanying the trough will overspread the
south-central Rockies, encouraging lee cyclogenesis over eastern CO
with a diffuse dryline extending southward across eastern NM.
Farther east, strong westerly midlevel flow on the backside of a
large-scale trough will cross the Mid-Atlantic states, where a dry
post-frontal airmass will be in place.

...Southwest into the Southern and Central High Plains...
Beneath gradually clearing high clouds, diurnal heating of a dry
antecedent airmass will favor deep boundary-layer mixing into the
enhanced west-southwesterly flow aloft behind the dryline. As a
result, RH in the single digits to lower/middle teens will develop
over the Southwest, while 15-25 percent RH is expected over the
central/southern High Plains. Over northeastern AZ and northwestern
NM, 20-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly surface winds (with
higher gusts) coupled with the dry/deeply-mixed boundary layer will
yield critical fire-weather conditions. Slightly weaker sustained
winds over the central and southern High Plains should support
elevated conditions, though locally critical conditions will be
possible over terrain-favored areas.

...Dry Thunderstorms - Central and Southern High Plains...
In the vicinity of the lee surface low and southward extending
dryline, isolated to widely scattered high-based thunderstorm
development is expected. Deep inverted-v profiles, PWs near 0.5
inches, and quick storm motions should favor dry thunderstorms with
limited rainfall. As these thunderstorms move over very dry fuels,
isolated lightning-induced ignitions will be possible -- especially
in the early stages of development. Gusty/erratic outflow winds
could also accompany the stronger thunderstorms.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Under mostly clear skies, efficient diurnal heating/mixing of a dry
post-frontal airmass could favor 25-30 percent minimum RH across the
Mid-Atlantic states -- where 15 mph sustained west-northwesterly
surface winds are forecast. This could result in locally elevated
conditions, though recent measurable rainfall across the region
should generally mitigate the fire-weather threat.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

...Synopsis...
A midlevel trough and enhanced west-southwesterly flow aloft will
overspread the Great Basin and impinge on the central and southern
Rockies. In response, a lee surface low will deepen over eastern CO,
with a dryline extending southward over the southern High Plains.
Farther east, deep/strong northwesterly flow on the backside of a
midlevel low will overspread the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states,
where a dry post-frontal airmass will remain in place.

...Southwest into the Southern High Plains...
As the enhanced west-southwesterly flow overspreads a dry antecedent
airmass across the Southwest and southern High Plains, 5-15 percent
RH will develop behind the dryline owing to efficient diurnal
heating/mixing. At the same time, sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds near 20-25 mph will develop atop critically dry fuels.
The best overlap of the strong surface winds and warm/dry
boundary-layer conditions is expected across portions of
east-central AZ, NM, and far west TX -- where Critical highlights
have been added.

...Northeast and Mid-Atlantic...
Breezy northwesterly surface winds of 15-20 mph are forecast across
parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, where 25-30 percent
RH will develop by peak heating. While these meteorological
conditions may support enhanced fire-weather conditions across the
region, recent precipitation casts uncertainty on the overall
receptiveness of fuels. With that said, drying of fine fuels is
expected on Wednesday, and fuel trends will be monitored closely.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Wed Apr 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022 - 12Z Wed May 04 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Saturday with a closed upper low
over the central/northern Plains along with a modestly deep
surface low, and these features will slowly lift northeast into
early next week. This will spread rain across much of the central
U.S. with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains on the backside of the low. Much of the
central and eastern U.S. can expect periodic showers and
thunderstorms through the first half of next week as fronts
linger. Additionally, periodic unsettled weather is forecast in
the Northwest as a series of upper troughs and frontal systems
move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Recent model guidance is reasonably agreeable as the medium range
forecast begins in terms of the central U.S. upper-level and
surface lows though with some slight spread in exact placement, as
well as an upper low slowly pulling away from the Canadian
Maritimes. There is good consensus for these features to track
east-northeastward with a general weakening trend for the central
U.S. lows through Sunday-Monday. There is somewhat more
variability with upstream energy coming into the Pacific Northwest
Saturday and its evolution going forward. GFS runs have been a bit
weaker with the shortwave initially but hold onto it perhaps
longer before getting absorbed in the east-central U.S. around
Monday-Tuesday. The early part of the WPC forecast featured a
blend of the deterministic guidance before gradually phasing out
some UKMET and CMC influence in favor of the ECMWF ensemble mean.

Another round of upper energy should spill into the West for the
early part of the workweek, likely closing off another upper low
as it tracks through the western and central CONUS. The 12Z GFS
was the fastest/farthest east with this feature, with the 18Z and
newer 00Z GFS and the rest of the deterministic guidance slower.
However, CMC runs have perhaps been too slow with the upper low's
movement, with even its 12Z ensemble mean faster. The ECMWF and EC
ensemble mean seemed like a good middle ground between these
slower and faster ends of the spectrum, so favored those for the
WPC forecast blend by the latter part of the period, with some
inclusion of the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 over
the weekend will spread precipitation across much of the central
and eastern U.S., with some wintry weather possible in the
Dakotas, with the best chances in the higher elevations of the
Black Hills. In portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin
as rain and transition to mixed precipitation or snow, though
details of these threats remain somewhat uncertain. Additionally,
rain could become heavy to locally excessive from parts of the
Plains into the Mississippi/Ohio Valleys on Saturday. Then as the
low pressure system shifts eastward early next week, precipitation
chances are expected to spread eastward, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Current forecasts show
potential for heavy rainfall on Sunday across the southern Plains,
though the axis of heaviest rainfall may shift in future
forecasts. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will likely persist
from the Plains eastward through the first half of next week.
Furthermore, rounds of light to moderate precipitation (snow in
the higher elevations and rain in the lower elevations) are
forecast across the Northwest as a series of fronts cross the
region along with upper-level energy. One such front and low
pressure system could eject into the central U.S. around midweek.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 15-25F underneath periodic upper troughing. Meanwhile,
slightly above normal temperatures should stretch across much of
the southern tier, and into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys as well,
particularly in terms of warmer than normal lows.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 AM EDT Wed Apr 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 30 2022 - 12Z Wed May 04 2022

...Overview...

The medium range period begins Saturday with a closed upper low
over the central/northern Plains along with a modestly deep
surface low, and these features will slowly lift northeast into
early next week. This will spread rain across much of the central
U.S. with some chance of wintry weather spreading into the
northern High Plains on the backside of the low. Much of the
central and eastern U.S. can expect periodic showers and
thunderstorms through the first half of next week as fronts
linger. Additionally, periodic unsettled weather is forecast in
the Northwest as a series of upper troughs and frontal systems
move through.


...Model Guidance Evaluation...

Recent model guidance is reasonably agreeable as the medium range
forecast begins in terms of the central U.S. upper-level and
surface lows though with some slight spread in exact placement, as
well as an upper low slowly pulling away from the Canadian
Maritimes. There is good consensus for these features to track
east-northeastward with a general weakening trend for the central
U.S. lows through Sunday-Monday. There is somewhat more
variability with upstream energy coming into the Pacific Northwest
Saturday and its evolution going forward. GFS runs have been a bit
weaker with the shortwave initially but hold onto it perhaps
longer before getting absorbed in the east-central U.S. around
Monday-Tuesday. The early part of the WPC forecast featured a
blend of the deterministic guidance before gradually phasing out
some UKMET and CMC influence in favor of the ECMWF ensemble mean.

Another round of upper energy should spill into the West for the
early part of the workweek, likely closing off another upper low
as it tracks through the western and central CONUS. The 12Z GFS
was the fastest/farthest east with this feature, with the 18Z and
newer 00Z GFS and the rest of the deterministic guidance slower.
However, CMC runs have perhaps been too slow with the upper low's
movement, with even its 12Z ensemble mean faster. The ECMWF and EC
ensemble mean seemed like a good middle ground between these
slower and faster ends of the spectrum, so favored those for the
WPC forecast blend by the latter part of the period, with some
inclusion of the 18Z GFS and GEFS mean.


...Sensible Weather/Threats...

The first surface low pressure system affecting the lower 48 over
the weekend will spread precipitation across much of the central
and eastern U.S., with some wintry weather possible in the
Dakotas, with the best chances in the higher elevations of the
Black Hills. In portions of the Dakotas, precipitation may begin
as rain and transition to mixed precipitation or snow, though
details of these threats remain somewhat uncertain. Additionally,
rain could become heavy to locally excessive from parts of the
Plains into the Mississippi/Ohio Valleys on Saturday. Then as the
low pressure system shifts eastward early next week, precipitation
chances are expected to spread eastward, but linger in the central
U.S. as well as the front there may stall. Current forecasts show
potential for heavy rainfall on Sunday across the southern Plains,
though the axis of heaviest rainfall may shift in future
forecasts. Scattered showers and thunderstorms will likely persist
from the Plains eastward through the first half of next week.
Furthermore, rounds of light to moderate precipitation (snow in
the higher elevations and rain in the lower elevations) are
forecast across the Northwest as a series of fronts cross the
region along with upper-level energy. One such front and low
pressure system could eject into the central U.S. around midweek.

Temperature-wise, the general trend over the lower 48 will be for
cooler than average weather in the northern tier and cooler than
average in the southern tier. The core of the coldest air should
be across the northern High Plains to Midwest, where highs will be
around 15-25F underneath periodic upper troughing. Meanwhile,
slightly above normal temperatures should stretch across much of
the southern tier, and into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys as well,
particularly in terms of warmer than normal lows.

...Coastal storm to produce rain and snow across northern New
England through the end of the week...

...Isolated chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding
over the next few days throughout the southern/central Plains and
Mid-Mississippi Valley, with critical fire weather expected across
the southern High Plains and southern Rockies...

...Developing storm system over the central U.S. on Friday to
generate areas heavy snow across the northern Rockies, heavy rain
over the northern Plains, and potentially severe thunderstorms in
the central/southern Plains on Friday...

A developing area of low pressure over the Gulf of Maine this
morning is forecast to strengthen and pivot near the Bay of Fundy
tonight. As it does so, rain and higher elevation snow will
overspread much of northern New England. Northern Maine in
particular is expected to see the most impacts associated with
snowfall, as accumulations add up to around 4 to 8 inches with
locally higher amounts in the highest elevations. This coastal
storm will be slow to exit as a closed upper-level low enters the
picture and leads to the system becoming vertically stacked.
Breezy northwesterly winds and snow showers will linger through at
least late Friday. The chilly northwesterly flow will also aid in
much of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic experiencing below average
temperatures over the next several days. In fact, below average
temperatures will continue to stretch into the Midwest and
northern Plains thanks to a strong high pressure system building
southward from Ontario. Widespread highs will reach into the 40s
and 50s, with lows dipping into the 20s and 30s. Sensitive
vegetation throughout the Midwest, Ohio Valley, and Mid-Atlantic
will endure frost/freeze chances until late this week.

Meanwhile, a stationary boundary extending from the
Mid-Mississippi Valley into the central Plains, a forming dryline
over the southern High Plains, and embedded shortwaves within an
upper-level ridge will create chances for isolated severe
thunderstorms and instances of flash flooding across the central
U.S. through Thursday. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Marginal Risk (level 1/5) of severe thunderstorms for today from
south-central Nebraska to the Texas Panhandle and northeast New
Mexico, where a few storms could produce damaging wind gusts and
large hail. The marginal severe storm threat shifts slightly east
into the central and southern Plains on Thursday. Isolated
instances of flash flooding are also possible on Thursday from the
central Plains into the middle Mississippi Valley as showers and
storms form along the aforementioned stationary front. On the dry
side of this system, critical fire weather is forecast from the
southern Rockies to the southern High Plains through the end of
the week. Low relative humidity and gusty winds could create an
environment conducive for rapid wildfire spread, which has also
prompted Red Flag Warnings and Fire Weather Watches to be issued
for parts of Arizona, New Mexico, southwest Colorado, and West
Texas.

The next large-scale weather maker to impact the Nation will begin
to take shape late Thursday as a potent and negatively tilted
upper-level trough enters the Intermountain West. In tandem, an
area of low pressure is forecast to develop over the central High
Plains and aid in producing a widespread area of precipitation
extending across the northern Plains and northern Rockies on
Friday. Heavy snow is possible across the higher terrain of
northwest Wyoming and western/central Montana. Snowfall
accumulations over 6 inches are possible for locations above 5000
feet and could impact travel overnight when snowfall is most
likely to stick to road surfaces. Additionally, periods of heavy
rain are expected over the northern Plains. Rainfall totals over 2
inches may lead to increasing chances for flash flooding from
south-central North Dakota to central South Dakota, where a Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of excessive rainfall has been issued. Showers
and thunderstorms will also extend into the central/southern
Plains and Mid-Mississippi Valley by Friday afternoon ahead of a
sharp dryline, with storms capable of producing damaging wind
gusts, large hail, and tornadoes. SPC has issued an Enhanced Risk
(level 3/5) of severe weather from far southeast Nebraska to
eastern Kansas, with a larger Slight Risk (level 2/5) extending
from Nebraska to far north-central Texas.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1028 AM CST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 041700Z - 051200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EAST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO...PARTS OF
THE TEXAS PANHANDLE AND SOUTH PLAINS...

The forecast remains on track. Morning soundings from AMA and MAF
show a very dry airmass at low/mid levels. Despite some stunted
mixing across parts of the Texas Panhandle due to cloud cover, RH
that is already in the 20% range should continue to fall into the
afternoon. See the previous discussion for further details.

..Wendt.. 01/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CST Tue Jan 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
A low amplitude trough and strong mid-level jet streak will move
across the Central Rockies and Plains through the day. As strong
flow overspreads the region, a lee low and trough should develop
supporting strong westerly flow across the central and southern High
Plains. Warming temperatures and drying conditions will likely
support elevated and critical fire weather potential through the
afternoon.

...Southern High Plains...
Enhanced by flow aloft from the aforementioned jet and surface
troughing in the lee of the Rockies, west/southwesterly flow should
increase through the day across portions of eastern NM into portions
of west TX and OK. Warming temperatures during the day should
overlap with a very dry airmass supporting diurnal RH minimums of
8-15% across much of the southern High Plains. While recent
precipitation and cold temperatures have tempered fuels somewhat
across the region, fine fuels have shown a fair bit of drying over
the last several days. With surface gusts of 20-30 mph expected
through the afternoon, additional drying of the low RH airmass and
fine fuels should support a risk for elevated and critical fire
weather conditions across portions of eastern NM and the TX
Panhandle.

A low-end risk for locally elevated fire weather conditions may also
extended across the central Plains where stronger westerly downslope
flow should develop during the afternoon. On the fringes of the
warmer airmass and within recent precipitation, humidity values may
struggle to reach near critical criteria. However drying fine fuels
and gusty west winds may support a few hours of dry and breezy
conditions.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
155 PM EST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Jan 07 2022 - 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. through the
beginning of next week should remain fairly amplified but also
progressive.  A strong shortwave trough and associated nor'easter
will exit the East Coast Friday, and this should give way to a
Canadian surface high and cold weather settling across the
east-central U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front.  Inland
progression of an early Friday Pacific Northwest system will bring
a drier trend to that region as upper ridging builds over the West
by Sunday-Monday.  Meanwhile by the weekend the flow ahead of
Plains low pressure and a trailing cold front will support an
expanding area of rain from the Gulf Coast into at least the
Tennessee Valley.  Also another surge of arctic air will reach the
north-central U.S. behind the system.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

There was reasonably good agreement for significant features in
the 00Z-06Z models/ensembles.  The large scale of the eastern
trough by early next week suggests better than average
predictability while there is some uncertainty with shortwaves
that may try to move into/around the upper ridge building into the
West.  Details become somewhat ambiguous over and near the
southwestern U.S. by the first half of next week as solutions
diverge for what becomes of smaller-scale energy in the
southernmost part of the upper trough crossing the West during the
weekend as well as another feature that approaches from the
Pacific.  A blend of the latest operational models represented
consensus ideas from Friday into Sunday and incorporating some
weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along with the 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/CMC reflected the continued large scale agreement while
accounting for the uncertainty near the Southwest next week.  The
resulting forecast yielded good continuity.

Guidance is finally better clustered for the deepening storm that
tracks from off the New England coast into the Canadian Maritimes
late this week.  Today's GFS runs are stronger versus a number of
prior runs while the consistently strong ECMWF has nudged its
track a bit to the east over the past couple days.  New guidance
still shows various ideas for the weak shortwave energy that may
linger over the Southwest by late weekend/early next week with the
GFS still weakest/most progressive and 00Z ECMWF the most
concentrated.  The 00Z ECMWF's handling of that feature likely
plays a role in its greater deflection of approaching Pacific
energy versus what most other models and means show.  12Z ECMWF
trends are favorable compared to other guidance.

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

After an active period of weather during the short range period
across the Pacific Northwest, some lingering rain and mountain
snow is still likely from northern California to western
Washington, and snow for the Northern Rockies, on Friday.  A
drying trend should commence in time for the weekend across much
of the West as high pressure builds back into the region.
Meanwhile, an intensifying nor'easter off the New England Coast on
Friday may produce some snow over eastern/northern New England in
particular (amounts very sensitive to exact track) along with
lingering snow showers over the rest of the Northeast.  New
England may see a brief period of brisk to strong winds behind
this system.  Gulf moisture ahead of a Plains cold front should
spread rain and thunderstorms from the Lower Mississippi Valley
into the Tennessee Valley/southern Appalachians this weekend with
lesser amounts of rain extending farther north.  Some locally
moderate to heavy activity is possible but confidence in specifics
is fairly low at this time.  Areas from the upper Great Lakes into
the Northeast could see wintry weather, either exclusively or
before a changeover to rain.  Parts of the Great Lakes may see
lake effect snow behind the passing front.

Temperatures will be quite cold across the central/northern Plains
to the Upper Midwest on Friday with a large surface high of arctic
origin governing the weather pattern for this region.  Lows may be
20-30F below normal while highs 15-20F or so below normal may
extend as far southeast as the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians.  Expect some moderation of the severe cold over the
Plains/Midwest on Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge that
reaches into the northern tier states by Sunday-Monday.  The
second surge may not be quite as intense as its predecessor but
temperatures could still be 15-25F below normal over some areas.
From Friday into Sunday above normal temperatures will progress
from the southern Plains into the Deep South with greatest
anomalies of plus 20-25F possible at some locations for highs on
Saturday and morning lows on Sunday.  Seasonably cold conditions
are likely west of the Continental Divide with readings generally
within 10 degrees of climatological averages, though locally a
little more than that on the warm side of normal for lows on
Friday-Saturday.

155 PM EST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 12Z Fri Jan 07 2022 - 12Z Tue Jan 11 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

The upper level pattern over the continental U.S. through the
beginning of next week should remain fairly amplified but also
progressive.  A strong shortwave trough and associated nor'easter
will exit the East Coast Friday, and this should give way to a
Canadian surface high and cold weather settling across the
east-central U.S. in the wake of the strong cold front.  Inland
progression of an early Friday Pacific Northwest system will bring
a drier trend to that region as upper ridging builds over the West
by Sunday-Monday.  Meanwhile by the weekend the flow ahead of
Plains low pressure and a trailing cold front will support an
expanding area of rain from the Gulf Coast into at least the
Tennessee Valley.  Also another surge of arctic air will reach the
north-central U.S. behind the system.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

There was reasonably good agreement for significant features in
the 00Z-06Z models/ensembles.  The large scale of the eastern
trough by early next week suggests better than average
predictability while there is some uncertainty with shortwaves
that may try to move into/around the upper ridge building into the
West.  Details become somewhat ambiguous over and near the
southwestern U.S. by the first half of next week as solutions
diverge for what becomes of smaller-scale energy in the
southernmost part of the upper trough crossing the West during the
weekend as well as another feature that approaches from the
Pacific.  A blend of the latest operational models represented
consensus ideas from Friday into Sunday and incorporating some
weight of the 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means along with the 06Z GFS and
00Z ECMWF/CMC reflected the continued large scale agreement while
accounting for the uncertainty near the Southwest next week.  The
resulting forecast yielded good continuity.

Guidance is finally better clustered for the deepening storm that
tracks from off the New England coast into the Canadian Maritimes
late this week.  Today's GFS runs are stronger versus a number of
prior runs while the consistently strong ECMWF has nudged its
track a bit to the east over the past couple days.  New guidance
still shows various ideas for the weak shortwave energy that may
linger over the Southwest by late weekend/early next week with the
GFS still weakest/most progressive and 00Z ECMWF the most
concentrated.  The 00Z ECMWF's handling of that feature likely
plays a role in its greater deflection of approaching Pacific
energy versus what most other models and means show.  12Z ECMWF
trends are favorable compared to other guidance.

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

After an active period of weather during the short range period
across the Pacific Northwest, some lingering rain and mountain
snow is still likely from northern California to western
Washington, and snow for the Northern Rockies, on Friday.  A

is fairly low at this time.  Areas from the upper Great Lakes into
the Northeast could see wintry weather, either exclusively or
before a changeover to rain.  Parts of the Great Lakes may see
lake effect snow behind the passing front.

Temperatures will be quite cold across the central/northern Plains
to the Upper Midwest on Friday with a large surface high of arctic

20-30F below normal while highs 15-20F or so below normal may

reaches into the northern tier states by Sunday-Monday.  The
second surge may not be quite as intense as its predecessor but

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the 0Z GFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating amplified mid-level low (high) pressure dominatin=
g
the eastern (western) half of the contiguous U.S., weakening toward the end=
 of
week-2. This pattern increases chances of episodes of much below normal
temperatures across the Northeast during the period. A series of surface lo=

are anticipated to form in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska during week-2,
although multiple ensemble means indicate that the greatest chances for
related
hazards would occur at the end of week-1, with lingering potential at the
beginning of week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of periods of much below normal temperatures across parts of th=

FOR FRIDAY JANUARY 07 - TUESDAY JANUARY 11:

FOR WEDNESDAY JANUARY 12 - TUESDAY JANUARY 18: Mid-level toughing is predic=
ted
for the eastern half of the CONUS throughout week-2, with the greatest
negative
height departures occurring prior to the period, at the end of week-1. This
pattern is expected to support increased chances for episodes of much below
normal temperatures across parts of the Northeast throughout the period. Th=
e
ECMWF ensemble mean depiction of this mid-level trough continues to be more
amplified and persistent compared to the GEFS ensemble mean, translating to
the
ECMWF reforecast tool indicating elevated risk for much below normal
temperatures being more expansive and prolonged compared to the GEFS. The
ECMWF
reforecast tool shows periods of at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatu=
res
falling to the lowest 15th percentile and freezing from the Northeast to th=
e
Southeast during week-2, whereas the GEFS reforecast tool shows these
thresholds being primarily focused over northern New England. A slight risk=
 of
periods of much below normal temperatures is highlighted for the Northeast
throughout week-2, primarily based on the ECMWF reforecast tool, given it
being
favored by the mean week-2 temperature consolidation tool.



Surface high pressure is anticipated to form over the Great Basin during
week-2, which could support episodes of increased Diablo and Santa Ana wind=
s
in
central and southern California, respectively. A slight risk of episodes of
high winds is designated for coastal portions of central and Southern
California Jan 12 to 16. There is inherent uncertainty regarding the detail=
s
of
the orientation and placement of this surface high, and thus the timing and
locality of this wind hazard. The date range designated is based on the per=
iod
where there is the greatest indication from multiple model ensemble means o=
f
the synoptic pattern being most conducive for these wind hazards.



A series of surface lows are forecast to form over the Bering Sea and Gulf =
of
Alaska during the period, although today's models keep the surface lows
primarily closer to the Aleutians than the South Coast of Mainland Alaska a=
nd
the Alaska Panhandle than yesterday. Multiple ensemble means indicate the
greatest likelihood for the heaviest precipitation over the South Coast and
Alaska to occur by the end of week-1 but could still have lingering chances
for
heavy precipitation over the Alaska Panhandle during the beginning of week-=
2.
The reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of 3-day precipitation
exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch (2 inches locally), but keep it
limited to the Alaska Panhandle. Therefore, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for parts of the Alaska Panhandle, Jan 12 to 14. A
slight risk of high winds is maintained for coastal portions of the Alaska
Panhandle, Jan 12 to 14, where the reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile and 35 mph.



Multiple model ensemble means continue to show possible mid-level troughing
across parts of western and northern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians at t=
he
start of the period. There is even less agreement in today's reforecast too=
ls
regarding widespread much below normal temperature potential across the
northern and western Mainland compared to yesterday. The ECMWF reforecast t=
ool
only indicates areas north of the Brooks Range as having at least a 20% cha=
nce
of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile. The GEFS
reforecast tool shows portions of the northwestern and northern Mainland
reaching these criteria but is a relatively limited portion. Due to high
uncertainty, a related much below normal temperature is not designated at t=
his
time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 PM CST Tue Jan 04 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Locally elevated conditions appears possible, particularly in
eastern New Mexico where downslope winds could lead to modest
warming and drying. Sustained, widespread elevated conditions still
seem unlikely given the cooler temperatures and fairly poor vertical
mixing in the boundary layer. Most deterministic/ensemble guidance
is suggestive of a localized fire weather threat.

..Wendt.. 01/04/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0153 AM CST Tue Jan 04 2022/

...Synopsis...
Mostly zonal flow will persist into Day2/Wednesday with strong flow
aloft meandering slowly northward across the Rockies and central
CONUS. At the surface, a cold front will move south early in the day
across the southern High Plains before southerly flow returns in the
afternoon. A second much stronger front moving south through the
northern Rockies should also arrive later in the evening and early
morning hours of Day3/Thursday. Across much of the High Plains,
moderated temperatures and marginally dry humidity should develop
along with gusty, but confined surface winds of 15-20 mph. Fuels
will be drier after several days of dry and windy conditions, but
the quick shot of cool air may temper fine fuels enough to cause
some availability issues. Given the potential for a more moist
boundary layer with RH in the 25-30% range, the probability of
sustained elevated fire weather conditions appears low. However, a
few hours of localized elevated conditions may develop especially
across the northern TX/OK Panhandles and elevated probabilities will
be reevaluated should model guidance trend drier and more widespread
with gusty winds.

...More heavy mountain snow and coastal heavy rain in store from
the Pacific Northwest spreading into the northern/central
Rockies...

...A deepening low pressure system will bring a quick round of
snow and strong winds across the northern Plains followed by
enhanced snowfall over the Great Lakes next couple of days...

...Cold air pours down into Great Plains through mid-week;
critical fire weather risk for parts of Southern Plains into

...Another winter storm possible from the Tennessee Valley and
areas farther northeast on Thursday...

An active weather pattern will continue to direct moisture from
the Pacific toward the northwestern portion of the country for the
next couple of days as arctic air from western Canada will attempt
to filter into the Pacific Northwest.  This pattern will continue
to promote heavy mountain snow for the Cascades while milder air
from the Pacific will bring moderate to heavy rain closer to the
coast behind a warm front. In the mean time, the arctic air will
spill into the northern Plains against the northern Rockies.  This
will result in snow overspreading the northern to central Rockies
through tonight before spreading farther east into the
northern-central Plains on Wednesday.  At the same time, a low
pressure system currently intensifying over the northern Plains
will bring a quick round of snow and strong winds from the
northern Plains to the upper Midwest through Wednesday morning
followed by some lake-enhanced snowfall across the Great Lakes
Wednesday into Thursday.  The arctic air will then surge farther
south toward the southern Plains the next couple of days behind
the intensifying low as it tracks eastward across southeastern
Canada.  Frigid air with sub-zero day time temperatures will
engulf the northern Plains for the next couple of days while much
below normal temperatures spread farther south into the Plains.

By Thursday, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along
the arctic from over the Deep South,  This low pressure wave is
forecast to develop further as it tracks toward the northeast, and
is bringing an increasing threat of a winter storm from the
Tennessee Valley and areas farther northeast on Thursday.

Elsewhere, dry conditions caused by downsloping and strong winds
generated by a lee trough and mid-level jet will contribute to a
critical fire weather risk through early Wednesday for parts of
eastern New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
predicting an amplified
500-hPa circulation pattern across the forecast domain. During the 6-10 day
period, strong ridging is forecast to be centered over Eastern Siberia, and=
 an

the ensemble means with positive 500-hPa height anomalies forecast across m=
ost
of the CONUS. However, anomalous troughing and associated below normal 500-=
hPa
heights are forecast over the Northeast.

Increased probabilities of below normal temperatures are indicated over
northwestern Mainland Alaska supported by the dynamical model forecasts. Ab=
ove
normal temperatures are favored over most of southern Mainland Alaska and t=
he
Panhandle, underneath above normal 500-hPa heights and also associated with
predicted low-level onshore flow. A ridge forecast over the northwestern CO=
NUS
favors elevated probabilities for near to above normal temperatures for the
western and central CONUS, except for the Great Basin region where near to
below normal temperatures are favored due to forecast surface high pressure
and
accumulated snow impact. Above normal temperature probabilities are slightl=
y
elevated for parts of the Southeast underneath predicted above normal 500-h=
Pa
heights. Below normal temperatures are favored over parts of the western Gr=
eat
Lakes, most of the Mid-Atlantic, and much of the Northeast due to forecast
troughing and low-level northwestern flow.

Forecast low-level offshore flow leads to increased chances of near to belo=

precipitation is favored for southern Alaska due to predicted onshore flow.
Below normal precipitation is favored over much of the western CONUS eastwa=

Elevated chances of below normal precipitation also extend to the Great Lak=

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JAN 12 - 18 2022

The week-2 model forecasts depict a similar circulation pattern to the 6-10
day
period with some de-amplification and a slight retrogression of the main
features.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for parts of northwestern
Mainland Alaska, associated with forecast low-level easterly flow. Above
normal
temperatures are favored for central and southern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle underneath an anomalous ridge and low-level onshore flow. Near to
above normal temperatures are favored over most of the western two-thirds o=
f
the CONUS, as above normal mid-level heights are predicted to persist durin=
g
the period. The exception is for parts of the Intermountain region, where n=
ear
to below normal temperatures are likely due to forecast surface high pressu=
re
and accumulated snow impacts. Below normal temperatures are favored for the
Northeast and parts of the Mid-Atlantic, supported by the temperature
consolidation tool.

Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for the west coast of Mainla=
nd
Alaska, under predicted low-level offshore flow. Above normal precipitation=
 is
favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, associat=
ed
with forecast low-level onshore flow. Near to below normal precipitation is
favored across most of the western CONUS eastward to parts of the Central
Plains, under the predicted above normal 500-hPa heights. Slightly above
normal
precipitation is likely over parts of the Northern High Plains due to a cou=
ple

of
below normal precipitation are slightly elevated for much of the Midwest an=

 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=

the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
January 20.

...More heavy mountain snow and coastal heavy rain in store from
the Pacific Northwest spreading into the northern/central
Rockies...

...A deepening low pressure system will bring a quick round of
snow and strong winds across the northern Plains followed by
enhanced snowfall over the Great Lakes next couple of days...

...Cold air pours down into Great Plains through mid-week;
critical fire weather risk for parts of Southern Plains into
tonight...

...Another winter storm possible from the Tennessee Valley and
areas farther northeast on Thursday...

An active weather pattern will continue to direct moisture from
the Pacific toward the northwestern portion of the country for the
next couple of days as arctic air from western Canada will attempt
to filter into the Pacific Northwest.  This pattern will continue
to promote heavy mountain snow for the Cascades while milder air
from the Pacific will bring moderate to heavy rain closer to the
coast behind a warm front.  In the mean time, the arctic air will
spill into the northern Plains against the northern Rockies.  This
will result in snow overspreading the northern to central Rockies
through tonight before spreading farther east into the
northern-central Plains on Wednesday.

At the same time, a low pressure system currently intensifying
over the northern Plains will bring a quick round of snow and
strong winds from the northern Plains to the upper Midwest through
Wednesday morning followed by some lake-enhanced snowfall across
the Great Lakes Wednesday into Thursday.  The arctic air will then
surge farther south toward the southern Plains the next couple of
days behind the intensifying low which will track eastward across
southeastern Canada.  Frigid air with sub-zero daytime
temperatures will engulf the northern Plains for the next couple
of days while much below normal temperatures spread farther south
into the Plains.

By Thursday, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along
the arctic front over the Deep South,  The low pressure wave is
forecast to develop further as it tracks toward the northeast.
This will bring an increasing threat of a winter storm from the
Tennessee Valley and areas farther northeast on Thursday.

Elsewhere, dry conditions caused by downsloping and strong winds
generated by a lee trough and mid-level jet will contribute to
critical fire weather risk through early Wednesday for parts of
eastern New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 8 2022 - 12Z Wed Jan 12 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

An amplified but progressive upper level pattern is expected to be
in place through early next week with a deep trough tracking from
the Rockies to the East Coast, and a ridge axis moving into the
western U.S. from the eastern Pacific.  By next Wednesday a second
trough moves across the Plains and a storm system begins
approaching the Pacific Northwest, with more of a quasi-zonal flow
pattern over the eastern U.S. as the earlier trough departs.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite and ensembles continue to agree quite
well on the overall synoptic scale pattern, particularly through
the upcoming weekend.  Going in early next week, the models still
have a good handle on the deep trough over the East Coast region
and the timing of the cold front passage.  However, model
differences are more apparent for the western U.S. as a split flow
aloft likely develops.  Timing differences exist among the
CMC/ECMWF/GFS with northern stream energy approaching the Pacific
Northwest, and latitudinal differences with a potential closed low
near southern California.  By Wednesday, the GFS is faster with
this shortwave energy in the northern stream across the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley, compared to the slower CMC/ECMWF guidance.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Sunday, and then gradually increasing use of
the ECENS and GEFS means through early next week while still
keeping about 50 percent of a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend..

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

Gulf moisture advecting northward ahead of a developing
Plains/Midwest cold front is expected to result in increasing
coverage of showers and thunderstorms from eastern Texas and the
central Gulf Coast, to the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region
this weekend, with lighter rainfall expected farther north.  There
will likely be some embedded heavier rainfall across portions of
the Deep South where convection is persistent.  Areas from the
upper Great Lakes to the Northeast could see wintry weather, with
the best snowfall prospects over northern New England and northern
New York.  Parts of the Great Lakes may see lake effect snow
behind the passing front.  Going into next week, dry conditions
are expected across most of the nation except for some showers and
mountain snow over western Washington and Oregon associated with
the next storm system.

Some moderation of the severe cold over the Plains/Midwest is
expected on Saturday ahead of the next arctic surge that reaches
into the northern tier states by Sunday and into Monday.  The
second surge may not be quite as intense as what is expected for
the end of this week, but temperatures could still be 10-25F below
normal from eastern Montana to Wisconsin.  From Saturday into
Sunday, above normal temperatures will progress from the southern
Plains to the Deep South and Southeast U.S., with overnight lows
on the order of 15-25 degrees above normal across the central Gulf
Coast region Sunday morning.  Seasonably cold conditions are
likely west of the Continental Divide with readings generally
within 10 degrees of climatological averages, and 10-20 degrees
below normal for the East Coast by next Tuesday.

...A Slight Risk of heavy rainfall leading to flash flooding is in
effect for parts of the coastal Pacific Northwest on Thursday...

...More heavy mountain snow in store from the Pacific Northwest
spreading into the Northern/Central Rockies and Front Range...

...A low pressure system to continue producing blizzard conditions
across portions of the Northern Plains/Upper Midwest this morning
and heavy snow for the Great Lakes over the next couple of days...

...Cold air spills down into Great Plains and Midwest through
Thursday...

...Another winter storm possible from the Tennessee Valley to the
Northeast beginning Thursday...

An active weather pattern will continue to direct moisture from
the Pacific toward the northwestern portion of the country over
the next couple of days as arctic air from western Canada filters
into the Pacific Northwest and Northern/Central Rockies. This cold
airmass will convert the Pacific moisture heavy snow for the
Cascades and Northern/Central Rockies over the next couple of
days. Between 1-3 feet of snow is expected with isolated amounts
over 4 feet possible by Friday morning. Snow will also spread into
the Front Range of Wyoming and northwestern Nebraska today where
8-12 inches of snow is likely. A Slight Risk of heavy rainfall
leading to flash flooding is in effect on Thursday for parts of
the southwest Washington and northwest Oregon where several inches
of rain may cause hazardous conditions. A low pressure system will
arrive over the Pacific Northwest on Friday, bringing with it
another round of mountain snow and low elevation rainfall.

At the same time, a low pressure system currently intensifying
over the northern Plains will bring a quick round of snow and
strong winds from the northern Plains to the upper Midwest through
this morning followed by some lake-enhanced snowfall across the
Great Lakes Wednesday into Thursday. Blizzard like conditions are
expected to continue for parts of western North Dakota and
northeastern South Dakota into west Minnesota this morning. Arctic
air will then surge farther south and east toward the southern
Plains over the next couple of days behind the associated cold
front. Frigid air with sub-zero daytime temperatures will engulf
the northern Plains for the next couple of days while much below
normal temperatures spread farther south into the Plains and
Midwest.

By Thursday, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along
the arctic front over the Deep South. This low pressure wave is
forecast to develop further as it tracks toward the northeast.
This will bring an increasing threat of a winter storm from the
Tennessee Valley and areas farther northeast on Thursday. The
heaviest snow may fall over parts of the Central Appalachians
while ice may impact much of Tennessee and northern
Mississippi/Alabama.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

0147 AM CST Wed Jan 05 2022

Valid 051200Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow will linger across much of the central and
western US from the rear flank of a broad cyclonic gyre across the
East. A weak cold front will move south, reaching central Texas
early this morning, as a second stronger front quickly approaches
this evening and overnight. The influx of cold air will moderate
temperatures and increase humidity values across much of the central
and southern Plains. Despite gusty west winds enhanced by momentum
transport from the strong flow aloft, the misalignment of gusty
surface winds and dry surface conditions should keep fire weather
concerns low through much of the forecast period. A few hours of
locally elevated conditions may develop in the lee of the southern
Rockies across portions of eastern NM where lower humidity may hold
out longer. However, confidence in this scenario is low.

0150 AM CST Wed Jan 05 2022

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Stronger flow aloft will begin to lift northward away from the
central and southern CONUS as troughing is amplified to the east and
sub tropical ridging develops across the Southwest. At the surface,
high pressure will strengthen in the post frontal airmass across the
central CONUS. The cold and stable airmass will limit the potential
overlap of strong surface winds and low humidity across much of the
US. As such, fire weather concerns are minimal through the forecast
period.

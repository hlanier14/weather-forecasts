Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Mon May 09 2022

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHEASTERN
COLORADO...CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO...AND THE
PANHANDLES...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHERN
HIGH PLAINS....

...Portions of southeastern CO, central and northeastern NM, and the
Panhandles...

Morning observations showed clear skies and warming temperatures
across much of the Extremely Critical area. Very poor overnight
humidity recoveries with RH below 30% were observed along with wind
gusts of 25-45 mph. These extreme conditions are expected to
continue through this afternoon supporting dangerous wildfire-spread
potential, both with new fire starts and preexisting fires. Minor
changes have been made to the Extremely Critical area to align with
currently observed strong gusts/very low humidity. Please see the
previous discussion for more information.

..Lyons.. 05/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0137 AM CDT Mon May 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
A broad cyclonic upper flow pattern will remain in place across the
western and central CONUS as an embedded mid-level impulse ejects
into the northern Plains today. Still, considerably strong mid-level
flow is poised to graze the Southwest into the southern High Plains
as a surface low develops over or near the Colorado Front Range.
Very dry and windy conditions will develop during the afternoon and
promote dangerous wildfire-spread potential, both with new fire
starts and with preexisting fires.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
By afternoon, boundary-layer mixing and development of the Colorado
surface low will encourage 20-25 mph sustained west-southwesterly
surface winds amid 5-15 percent RH across the southwest quadrant of
the U.S., where widespread Elevated/Critical fire weather highlights
are in place. An Extremely Critical delineation remains across
northeast New Mexico into southeast Colorado, where the latest
guidance consensus depicts the strongest winds/gusts to coincide
with near-single-digit RH and anomalously dry fuels for at least a
few hours. This volatile combination of windy and dry conditions
atop fuels experiencing an exceptional drought may foster extreme
behavior among ongoing fires, as well as promote the rapid spread of
new starts throughout the afternoon.

...Blocky pattern favors record heat from the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Emerging heat threat for California and the Southwest by early
next week...


...Overview...

The blocky pattern into later this week will still feature a mean
trough aloft over the West, amplified upper ridging from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes/Northeast, and an upper low
off the Southeast coast.  Temperatures will likely challenge daily
records under and near the upper ridge axis late this week while
parts of the West will see chilly weather with rain and higher
elevation snow.  Between these regimes, a storm system emerging
over the northern Plains may produce some areas of heavy rainfall
where wet ground conditions already exist.  Then during the
weekend and early next week most guidance shows the pattern
transitioning toward a western ridge/east-central U.S. trough
configuration.  This evolution should finally push the rainfall
focus to the east of the Plains.  The initial upper low tracking
into the Southeast around Friday due to a retrograding Atlantic
ridge should quickly lift northward and open up during the
weekend, with associated rainfall spreading into and north from
the Carolinas.  The ridge building over the West will lead to
increasing coverage of very warm to hot temperatures over the
southern half of the West during Saturday-Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean seem reasonably well clustered into Day 3/4 (Thursday/Friday)
and a composite solution seems to offers a good forecast basis in
conjuncture with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. These
GFS/ECMWF runs, along with latest 12 UTC versions, remain best
compatible with the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means into days 5-7 and
this favored blend maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The strong upper ridge extending from the southern Plains through
the Great Lakes/Northeast as of Thursday will promote much above
normal temperatures from much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
through the Great Lakes and Northeast late this week.
Highs/morning lows will be at least 10-20F above normal with some
embedded plus 20-25F anomalies possible from the central Plains
into Great Lakes, and locations across a fairly broad area may
challenge daily records.  After Friday expect the above normal
temperatures to be more confined to the Great Lakes/Northeast and
the far southern Plains/western Gulf Coast region.  There will be
a lingering potential for daily records over the Northeast into
Saturday and over eastern Texas and vicinity through the end of
the period.

The frontal system and upper dynamics crossing the Northwest late
this week will produce a brief period of enhanced rain and high
elevation snow as well as highs 5-15F below normal.  Meanwhile the
southern part of the West should moderate to slightly above normal
by Friday.  Then arrival of the upper ridge will extend the
warming trend over the West through the weekend.  Highs of 10-20F
above normal should expand from California eastward from Saturday
onward and some locations could reach record highs by
Sunday-Monday.  Northern areas of the West should be closer to
normal and one or more fronts may produce periods of light to
moderate precipitation over the Pacific Northwest.

Late this week the system emerging from the West and developing
over the northern Plains before tracking into southern Canada,
along with associated fronts, may produce areas of heavy rainfall
over parts of the far northern tier where some areas are quite
sensitive to added rain due to very wet ground conditions.  The
experimental Day 4 (Thursday-Thursday night) Excessive Rainfall
Outlook shows a Slight Risk area over parts of northern North
Dakota and Minnesota where there is the best overlap of guidance
signals for significant rain and instability, along with high soil
moisture.  Depending on system evolution, areas farther west back
to the northern High Plains could also see significant rainfall.
Some locally moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms will be
possible farther south along the wavy trailing front (which may
hang up for about a day as western energy catches up to it) but so
far with less agreement for specifics.  The Storm Prediction
Center is also monitoring the potential for severe weather, so
check the latest outlooks for updated information.  Rainfall and
the focusing front should become more progressive from Saturday
onward, leading to a drier trend over the Plains.  Retrogression
of the western Atlantic upper low into the Southeast toward the
end of the week should spread enhanced rains into the Carolinas
and vicinity by Friday with some of this moisture spreading
northward across the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast this weekend. Highest
totals should be over or near the eastern Carolinas.  Amounts
farther north should trend lighter due to decreasing focus of
moisture as the upper low opens up while it lifts northward.

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Southern High Plains...
Late in the period, low-level moisture is forecast to surge westward
near a retreating dryline across portions of west TX and eastern NM.
A subtle shortwave trough passing along the eastern periphery of the
southwesterly flow aloft will overspread weak lift across the
moistening airmass Tuesday night. Isolated to widely scattered
thunderstorms may develop and persist for a few hours supporting the
development of lightning strikes within dry fuels. Area soundings
show mostly wet profiles with PWATS greater than 1 inch likely. The
slow storm motions and high water content suggests only limited
potential for dry strikes, though a few may be possible outside of
the better cores.

Elsewhere, the previous forecast remains valid with only minor
adjustments for the latest guidance. See the prior discussion for
more info.

..Lyons.. 05/09/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0138 AM CDT Mon May 09 2022/

...Synopsis...
While stronger mid-level flow will continue to shift northward into
the northern Plains through tomorrow/Tuesday, prevailing cyclonic
flow aloft and modest surface lee troughing across the High Plains
will trigger a mass response in the form of very dry westerly winds
across the Southwest. Given the presence of very dry fuels and no
beneficial rainfall in sight, significant wildfire-spread potential
will continue wherever drier/windier conditions materialize.

...Southwest...
The combination of downslope flow and the downward momentum
transport of the stronger mid-level flow (via boundary-layer mixing)
will support the development of widespread 15-25 mph sustained
westerly surface winds amid 10-15 percent RH. Elevated highlights
have been introduced wherever any dry/windy conditions are expected
to overlap fuels that are at least modestly receptive to wildfire
spread. Critical highlights were also introduced where the most
favorable surface wind/RH overlap will occur for several hours
tomorrow afternoon, and where fuels are critically to exceptionally
receptive to significant wildfire spread.

myJehRT1F1nZgQsSsXsE1LG_ZYqYhM$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 17 - MONDAY MAY 23: Dynamical models continue to advertise =
a
mid-level pattern change from week-1, which features the development of
above-normal mid-level heights centered over the Four Corners region of the
U.S. and more downstream troughing over the eastern U.S. during week-2. As
much
of the south-central CONUS is forecast to experience well above-normal, and
possibly near record breaking, maximum temperatures during week-1 (as
supported
by the National Blend of Models), this pattern transition is anticipated to
shift the hazardous heat potential across the southwestern U.S. during the
period. The greatest uncertainty for hazardous temperatures is over the Gul=
f
States, where there is some question as to how much of the cut-off low ener=
gy
over the Southeast phases in with a developing trough upstream over the Pla=
ins
and Mississippi Valley at the start of the period. This interaction may be
playing out more in the 0z ECMWF, which favors a deeper and more amplified
trough than the GEFS, resulting in cooler temperatures over the eastern CON=
US
at the start of the period.



Tied to the anomalous ridging favored aloft, there is good agreement betwee=
n
the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting a broad area with a least a 2=
0%
chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 degrees=
 F
(90 degrees F in the higher elevations of the West) from the Central
California
Valley to the Lower Mississippi Valley to support a slight risk of excessiv=
e
heat for the entirely of week-2. Two probability maximas (>40%) are indicat=
ed
among the reforecast tools in percentile space over the Desert Southwest an=
d
throughout the Southern Plains early in the period, where the former (latte=
r)
warm signal is shown to gradually weaken (strengthen) through the middle
portion of week-2. Given this evolution, a moderate risk of excessive heat =
is
issued for the Desert Southwest for May 17-18 where there are elevated chan=
ces
of maximum daytime temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 105 degre=
es
F. Another moderate risk area for excessive heat is designated mainly over =
the
Southern Plains for May 17-20, with an embedded high risk area over central
Texas where reforecast tools indicate at least a 60% chance of temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile from May 17-19. Although this signal is less
pronounced in the GEFS reforecast tool, there is good support in the
uncalibrated temperature guidance favoring mean maximum temperatures exceed=
ing
100 degrees in central Texas and 105 degrees near the Rio Grande Valley. Th=
is
is further supported by the National Blend of Models analysis depicting
several
locations approaching near record breaking temperatures early in the period=
.



In addition to the anomalous warmth expected throughout the southwestern
CONUS,
strengthening pressure gradients are favored in the ensembles and reforecas=
t
tools show increased chances of wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile t=
o
support a slight risk of high winds through the middle of week-2 (May 17-21=
).
The continued potential for high winds is likely to sustain an elevated
wildfire risk during the outlook period across the southwestern quarter of =
the
CONUS. Currently, multiple large wildfires are burning throughout New Mexic=
o
as
the largest wildfire incident, the Calf Canyon fire located east of Santa F=
e,
has burned over 189,000 acres (as of May 9) with less than half containment=
.
Drier than normal conditions are favored to accompany the anomalous warmth
during the next two weeks, which is expected to worsen drought conditions
throughout much of the southwestern CONUS and raises concern for rapid onse=
t
drought for parts of eastern Texas. Thus, rapid onset drought areas are pos=
ted
over eastern Texas, where near record heat and little to no precipitation i=
s
expected during the next two weeks.



For precipitation, the 0z GEFS is beginning to favor surface low formation
over
the Great Plains early in the period; however, this is less supported by th=
e
0z
ECMWF ensemble. Even with these differences in the predicted surface patter=
n,
both uncalibrated and calibrated guidance are quite tenuous in regards to t=
he
potential of heavy precipitation throughout much of the country. The one
exception being in the Pacific Northwest, where there are increased signals=
 in
the reforecast tools exceeding the 85th percentile tied to a shortwave
disturbance during the middle of the period. However, amounts are not expec=
ted
to exceed hazard thresholds and no corresponding precipitation hazards are
posted in today's outlook. Flooding may persist throughout week-2 in the Re=
d
River Valley of the North, and extend into part of the James River basin, d=
ue
to recent snowmelt and heavy precipitation. Across Alaska, above-normal
temperatures are favored for parts of the western and southern Mainland whi=
ch
may accelerate the rate of snowmelt and ice-river breakup and a flooding
possible hazard is maintained for much of the central and eastern Mainland.

...Summer-like heat to engulf much of the Heartland; critical to
extreme fire danger persists from the Southwest to the southern
High Plains...

...Cold and mountain snows from the West Coast to the northern
Rockies; Rounds of heavy rain & thunderstorms to sweep across the
northern Plains and Midwest...

...Severe storms possible in West Texas on Tuesday; Continued
chilly conditions along the East Coast with prolonged high surf
for coastal communities...

As an upper level ridge builds over the Mississippi Valley this
week, temperatures will continue to surge to summer-like levels
from the southern Plains to the Midwest. Record heat in the
southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley this afternoon
expands into the Middle Mississippi Valley on Tuesday, then into
the Midwest and Great Lakes by Wednesday and into Thursday. The
heat dome will extend into the Southwest where there is also an
extensive area under a Critical Risk for fire weather from
northern Arizona to central Oklahoma and Kansas. The area most
susceptible to fire weather this afternoon is northeast New
Mexico, southeast Colorado, and parts of the Oklahoma and Texas
Panhandle where an Extreme Risk of fire weather conditions is in
place due to dangerously low relative humidity levels, very dry
fuels, and high winds. Speaking of high winds, High Wind Warnings
are in place throughout much of the higher elevations and high
Plains of Colorado and New Mexico. Parts of eastern Wyoming and
western Nebraska are also under High Wind Warnings while much of
the Upper Midwest is also under Wind Advisories.

Throughout the western third of the Lower 48, a deep upper level
trough is set to keep anomalously colder temperatures entrenched
along the West Coast. More record breaking cold minimum temps are
expected in northern and central California Tuesday morning while
daily temperature anomalies up and down the West Coast range
between 10 and 20 degrees below normal. Temperatures will be cold
enough to where Hard Freeze Warnings have been issued for parts of
coastal northern California. Due to these cold temperatures,
precipitation will fall as snow in parts of the Shasta, Sierra
Nevada, and Bitterroots this afternoon and into early Tuesday with
several inches of accumulation on tap. Farther east, upper level
disturbances ejecting out of the upper trough will lead to daily
episodes of severe storms and heavy rain in parts of the Midwest
and Great Lakes. A frontal system is set to trigger severe storms
in the Upper Mississippi Valley this afternoon and evening with
the most at risk area being southeast Minnesota where an Enhanced
Risk from the Storm Prediction Center is in place. By Tuesday, the
approaching cold front stalls over the Great Lakes, causing severe
storms to fire over parts of Wisconsin and western Michigan.
Finally by Wednesday, a strengthening storm system in the central
High Plains and a lifting warm front is set to ignite more severe
storms in parts of the Dakotas and Upper Midwest. In advance of
this, both the Storm Prediction Center and Weather Prediction
centers have issued subsequent Slight Risks for parts of the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest for severe weather and Excessive
Rainfall.

Severe storms will also be possible both Tuesday and Wednesday in
the southern High Plains. A Slight Risk is in place for West Texas
on Tuesday while an expansive Marginal Risk stretches from the Big
Bend of Texas on north to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Farther
east, a strong and large area of high pressure has become wedged
over southeast Canada stretching on south into the Southeast
today. This high pressure will stick around through mid-week
keeping dry conditions in place with plenty of sunshine as well.
However, a lingering surface low off the East Coast will continue
to aid in funneling cool northerly flow down the coast, keeping
much of the I-95 corridor on east to the coast feeling quite cool
by mid-May standards. Some parts of the coast, from New England on
south to the North Carolina Outer Banks, will struggle to get out
of the 60s for highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. These same areas
are also contending with high surf which has led to the issuance
of Coastal Flood Warnings and Advisories for portions of the
Mid-Atlantic coast. Temperatures will rebound to warmer levels in
northern New England first with much of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
eventually returning to more seasonal temperature regimes the
second half of the week.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 09 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 15 - 19 2022

All models show a de-amplifying mid-level 500-hPa anomaly pattern over the
course of the 6 to 10 day period. The European operational model and the EC=
MWF
ensemble mean are slower to de-amplify the pattern, and therefore show more
amplification for the period as a whole, with a modest ridge continuing ove=
r
the western CONUS and a weak trough the northern Great Plains to the northe=
rn
Ohio Valley . Meanwhile, the GEFS mean, GFS Superensemble, and the 6z
operational GFS show quicker de-amplification, and so a less amplified aver=
age
pattern, with largely zonal flow and slightly above-normal 500-hPa heights
across the CONUS. The Canadian ensemble mean solution is something of a
compromise between the two solutions, but leans closer to the less-amplifie=
d
solution. Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs outlook favors the preponderanc=
e of the models (quicker
evolution toward less amplification), and thus a more zonal pattern with
relatively small 500-hPa height anomalies for the 6 to 10 day period as a
whole.

Models generally agree that the period will start with a strong ridge
southwest
of Alaska, a lesser ridge over the western CONUS, some degree of troughing
from
the northern Great Plains into the Great Lakes region and northern Ohio
Valley,
and a fairly strong ridge across eastern Canada and the northeast CONUS. Th=
is
creates enhanced chances for above-normal temperatures in the Northeast, th=
e
mid-Atlantic region, the southern tier of the country, and central sections=
 of
the Rockies and Intermountain West. A significant early-season heat wave wi=
ll
affect areas from the eastern Great Basin and Southwest through the souther=
n
Great Plains and lower Mississippi Valley, with high temperatures at or nea=
r
record levels expected. Toward the end of the period, the de-amplifying
pattern
will suppress the excessive heat to the southern tier of the CONUS as
conditions ease farther north. Meanwhile, fairly weak troughing southwest o=
f
Canada and over parts of the northern Great Plains, Great Lakes region, and
part of the northern Ohio Valley enhances the chances for subnormal average
temperatures there, though not as strongly as the warmth is favored farther
south and east.

In addition, elevated chances for drier than normal conditions will exist n=
ear
and downstream of the western CONUS ridge, with slightly increased chances =
for
above normal precipitation precipitation in the Pacific Northwest and the
northeastern CONUS, near or downstream of the mean mid-level troughs.

The strong but quickly de-amplifying mid-level ridge southwest of Alaska
slightly enhances the odds for above normal temperatures and below normal
precipitation in the southwestern part of the Mainland, with slightly enhan=
ced
chances for cool, wet conditions farther north and east.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 20% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 10% of Today=
's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is below
average, 2 out of 5, with decreased confidence particularly later in the
period
as the mid-level pattern de-amplifies.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 17 - 23 2022

There is general model agreement on continued de-amplification and
increasingly
zonal mid-level flow that began during the 6 to 10 day period. The European
ensemble mean remains more amplified than Canadian ensembles and GEFS, hang=
ing
on to a low-amplitude mid-level ridge in the Southwest and a weak trough
downstream in the Northeast and the Great Lakes Region. The Canadian ensemb=
le
mean puts very slightly above normal 500-hPa heights over the Southwest, wi=
th
near-normal 500-hPa heights elsewhere. The GEFS remains the least amplified=
 of
the ensembles, with no 500-hPa anomalies exceeding 3 dm anywhere across Nor=
th
America. Farther west, the Canadian and ECMWF ensemble means keep a ridge o=
f
low to moderate amplitude over or near southwestern Mainland Alaska.

The flat mid-level flow will continue to confine the unseasonably hot weath=
er
to the southern tier of the CONUS. Record or near-record high temperatures
primarily over the southern Great Plains and the lower Mississippi Valley
should slowly ease during week-2; otherwise, enhanced chances for other
anomalies of temperatures or precipitation are low. Elevated chances for
cooler
than normal conditions cover the Great Lakes Region and adjacent areas, as
well
as parts of the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, odds tilt toward below normal
precipitation again across much of the Great Plains, central Rockies, and
eastern Great Basin, while above normal precipitation is marginally favored=
 in
parts of the Northwest, Ohio Valley, and Northeast.

Mainland Alaska continues to have slightly increased chances for warmer tha=
n
normal conditions in southwestern sections, with subnormal temperatures
favored
farther to the northeast. Meanwhile, uncertainty in pattern details means t=
he
outlook does not significantly favor either wetness or dryness over much of
the
state, although odds tilt very slightly toward wetness in northwestern
sections, and dryness along parts of the southern tier.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 30% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 1=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 10% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Forecast confidence is much lo=
wer
than normal, 1 out of 5, because of the uncertainties inherent in magnitude
and
particularly the location of anomalous temperature and precipitation in an
unusually flat, progressive mid-level pattern.

FORECASTER: Rich Tinker

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
19.

...Blocky pattern favors record heat from the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Emerging heat threat for California and the Southwest by early
next week...


...Overview...

The blocky pattern into later this week will still feature a mean
trough aloft over the West, amplified upper ridging from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes/Northeast, and an upper low
off the Southeast coast.  Temperatures will likely challenge daily
records under and near the upper ridge axis late this week while
parts of the West will see chilly weather with rain and higher
elevation snow.  Between these regimes, a storm system emerging
over the northern Plains may produce some areas of heavy rainfall
where wet ground conditions already exist.  Then during the
weekend and early next week most guidance shows the pattern
transitioning toward a western ridge/east-central U.S. trough
configuration.  This evolution should finally push the rainfall
focus to the east of the Plains.  The initial upper low tracking
into the Southeast around Friday due to a retrograding Atlantic
ridge should quickly lift northward and open up during the
weekend, with associated rainfall spreading into and north from
the Carolinas.  The ridge building over the West will lead to
increasing coverage of very warm to hot temperatures over the
southern half of the West during Saturday-Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean seem reasonably well clustered into Day 3/4 (Thursday/Friday)
and a composite solution seems to offers a good forecast basis in
conjuncture with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. These
GFS/ECMWF runs, along with latest 12 UTC versions, remain best
compatible with the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means into days 5-7 and
this favored blend maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The strong upper ridge extending from the southern Plains through
the Great Lakes/Northeast as of Thursday will promote much above
normal temperatures from much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
through the Great Lakes and Northeast late this week.
Highs/morning lows will be at least 10-20F above normal with some
embedded plus 20-25F anomalies possible from the central Plains
into Great Lakes, and locations across a fairly broad area may
challenge daily records.  After Friday expect the above normal
temperatures to be more confined to the Great Lakes/Northeast and
the far southern Plains/western Gulf Coast region.  There will be
a lingering potential for daily records over the Northeast into
Saturday and over eastern Texas and vicinity through the end of
the period.

The frontal system and upper dynamics crossing the Northwest late
this week will produce a brief period of enhanced rain and high
elevation snow as well as highs 5-15F below normal.  Meanwhile the
southern part of the West should moderate to slightly above normal
by Friday.  Then arrival of the upper ridge will extend the
warming trend over the West through the weekend.  Highs of 10-20F
above normal should expand from California eastward from Saturday
onward and some locations could reach record highs by
Sunday-Monday.  Northern areas of the West should be closer to
normal and one or more fronts may produce periods of light to
moderate precipitation over the Pacific Northwest.

Late this week the system emerging from the West and developing
over the northern Plains before tracking into southern Canada,
along with associated fronts, may produce areas of heavy rainfall
over parts of the far northern tier where some areas are quite
sensitive to added rain due to very wet ground conditions.  The
experimental Day 4 (Thursday-Thursday night) Excessive Rainfall
Outlook shows a Slight Risk area over parts of northern North
Dakota and Minnesota where there is the best overlap of guidance
signals for significant rain and instability, along with high soil
moisture.  Depending on system evolution, areas farther west back
to the northern High Plains could also see significant rainfall.
Some locally moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms will be
possible farther south along the wavy trailing front (which may
hang up for about a day as western energy catches up to it) but so
far with less agreement for specifics.  The Storm Prediction
Center is also monitoring the potential for severe weather, so
check the latest outlooks for updated information.  Rainfall and
the focusing front should become more progressive from Saturday
onward, leading to a drier trend over the Plains.  Retrogression
of the western Atlantic upper low into the Southeast toward the
end of the week should spread enhanced rains into the Carolinas
and vicinity by Friday with some of this moisture spreading
northward across the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast this weekend. Highest
totals should be over or near the eastern Carolinas.  Amounts
farther north should trend lighter due to decreasing focus of
moisture as the upper low opens up while it lifts northward.

Extended Forecast Discussion

424 PM EDT Mon May 09 2022

...Blocky pattern favors record heat from the Southern
Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast along
with episodes of central U.S. convection and an emerging onshore
rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Emerging heat threat for California and the Southwest by early
next week...


...Overview...

The blocky pattern into later this week will still feature a mean
trough aloft over the West, amplified upper ridging from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes/Northeast, and an upper low
off the Southeast coast.  Temperatures will likely challenge daily
records under and near the upper ridge axis late this week while
parts of the West will see chilly weather with rain and higher
elevation snow.  Between these regimes, a storm system emerging
over the northern Plains may produce some areas of heavy rainfall
where wet ground conditions already exist.  Then during the
weekend and early next week most guidance shows the pattern
transitioning toward a western ridge/east-central U.S. trough
configuration.  This evolution should finally push the rainfall
focus to the east of the Plains.  The initial upper low tracking
into the Southeast around Friday due to a retrograding Atlantic
ridge should quickly lift northward and open up during the
weekend, with associated rainfall spreading into and north from
the Carolinas.  The ridge building over the West will lead to
increasing coverage of very warm to hot temperatures over the
southern half of the West during Saturday-Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian/ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean seem reasonably well clustered into Day 3/4 (Thursday/Friday)
and a composite solution seems to offers a good forecast basis in
conjuncture with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models. These
GFS/ECMWF runs, along with latest 12 UTC versions, remain best
compatible with the GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means into days 5-7 and
this favored blend maintains good WPC product continuity.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

The strong upper ridge extending from the southern Plains through
the Great Lakes/Northeast as of Thursday will promote much above
normal temperatures from much of the Plains and Mississippi Valley
through the Great Lakes and Northeast late this week.
Highs/morning lows will be at least 10-20F above normal with some
embedded plus 20-25F anomalies possible from the central Plains
into Great Lakes, and locations across a fairly broad area may
challenge daily records.  After Friday expect the above normal
temperatures to be more confined to the Great Lakes/Northeast and
the far southern Plains/western Gulf Coast region.  There will be
a lingering potential for daily records over the Northeast into
Saturday and over eastern Texas and vicinity through the end of
the period.

The frontal system and upper dynamics crossing the Northwest late
this week will produce a brief period of enhanced rain and high
elevation snow as well as highs 5-15F below normal.  Meanwhile the
southern part of the West should moderate to slightly above normal
by Friday.  Then arrival of the upper ridge will extend the
warming trend over the West through the weekend.  Highs of 10-20F
above normal should expand from California eastward from Saturday
onward and some locations could reach record highs by
Sunday-Monday.  Northern areas of the West should be closer to
normal and one or more fronts may produce periods of light to
moderate precipitation over the Pacific Northwest.

Late this week the system emerging from the West and developing
over the northern Plains before tracking into southern Canada,
along with associated fronts, may produce areas of heavy rainfall
over parts of the far northern tier where some areas are quite
sensitive to added rain due to very wet ground conditions.  The
experimental Day 4 (Thursday-Thursday night) Excessive Rainfall
Outlook shows a Slight Risk area over parts of northern North
Dakota and Minnesota where there is the best overlap of guidance
signals for significant rain and instability, along with high soil
moisture.  Depending on system evolution, areas farther west back
to the northern High Plains could also see significant rainfall.
Some locally moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms will be
possible farther south along the wavy trailing front (which may
hang up for about a day as western energy catches up to it) but so
far with less agreement for specifics.  The Storm Prediction
Center is also monitoring the potential for severe weather, so
check the latest outlooks for updated information.  Rainfall and
the focusing front should become more progressive from Saturday
onward, leading to a drier trend over the Plains.  Retrogression
of the western Atlantic upper low into the Southeast toward the
end of the week should spread enhanced rains into the Carolinas
and vicinity by Friday with some of this moisture spreading
northward across the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast this weekend. Highest
totals should be over or near the eastern Carolinas.  Amounts
farther north should trend lighter due to decreasing focus of
moisture as the upper low opens up while it lifts northward.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
A blocked upper flow regime will prevail across the CONUS today,
with a broad upper trough meandering across the western/central U.S.
as a mid-level low remains stationary off of the Atlantic Coast.
While a broad swath of low-level moisture will usher northward
across the Plains due to lee troughing, dry and windy conditions are
expected to develop across portions of the Southwest and along the
East Coast, promoting fire weather concerns.

...Southwest...
Strong, deep-layer southerly flow will persist across the Southwest
as an upper trough and associated surface low meanders around the
Four Corners region today. At the surface, dry and windy conditions
are expected across the Southwest through the afternoon, promoting
Critical wildfire-spread potential. Elevated highlights have been
introduced for areas that should see 15+ mph sustained
south-southwesterly surface winds coinciding with 15-20 percent RH
through the afternoon, and where fuels are at least modestly
receptive to wildfire spread. Critical highlights have also been
introduced where 20+ mph winds and RH below 15 percent will overlap
with critically dry fuels through the afternoon.

...New England...
Dry northeasterly surface winds up to 15 mph will spread across
parts of New England given the presence of a cyclone situated off of
the Atlantic coastline. By afternoon peak heating, surface RH will
drop below 30 percent over portions of southern New Hampshire into
Massachusetts and Connecticut. Fuel guidance suggests that fuels
have recently become quite receptive to wildfire spread, with
Elevated highlights introduced for areas where the aforementioned
overlapping surface winds/RH will occur, and where rainfall
accumulations have remained at/under 0.50 inches in the past 2
weeks.

...Southeast...
Surface high pressure and associated dry northerly flow will prevail
across southern Georgia into the Florida Panhandle and central
Florida Peninsula this afternoon. Guidance consensus shows RH
dipping into the 20-35 percent range by afternoon peak heating,
where the latest forecast fuel guidance shows ERCs in the 80-95th
percentile range. However, surface winds are expected to be weak
overall (barely reaching 10 mph in several locales), hence the
withholding of fire weather highlights. Nonetheless, at least
localized wildfire-spread concerns will exist wherever gusty winds
may develop.

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST...

...Synopsis...
Surface-low intensification is expected around the Four Corners as
the upper trough ejects eastward and overspreads the Rockies
tomorrow/Wednesday. 15-25 mph sustained southwesterly surface winds
will coincide with 10-15 percent RH by afternoon as the boundary
layer mixes, promoting at least Elevated conditions for wildfire
spread across the Southwest. Critical highlights have also been
introduced where the strongest winds/lowest RH overlap for several
hours atop critically dry fuels Wednesday afternoon.

Dry northerly flow will continue across the Florida Peninsula
tomorrow as a surface low meanders off of the Atlantic Coast. Latest
guidance consensus shows RH dropping below 30 percent by afternoon
peak heating, with some guidance members showing surface winds
reaching 15 mph at times. Confidence is not quite high enough to
introduce Elevated highlights, given the lack of upper support to
force a stronger low-level wind field. If guidance continues to
depict more widespread 15 mph winds in later guidance, future
outlooks may include Elevated highlights for the western half of the
Florida Peninsula.

...Lingering blocky pattern to extend record heat from the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast
late week along with episodes of central U.S. convection and an
emerging onshore rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while heat persists eastward over far
southern tier areas...


...Overview...

Guidance continues to show the large scale upper pattern
transitioning from a blocky regime late this week toward an
eastern Pacific trough, western U.S. into High Plains ridge, and
eastern U.S. trough.  A broad area of much above normal
temperatures into late this week from the southern Plains into
Great Lakes/Northeast, with numerous daily records possible, will
eventually moderate over the northern two-thirds of the country as
a wavy front over the Plains (a possible focus for at least some
locally heavy rainfall) pushes farther eastward ahead of the
approaching trough.  Meanwhile an upper low reaching the Southeast
by Friday will quickly open up as it lifts northward, spreading
rainfall into and north from the Carolinas.  The upper ridge
building into/through the West will moderate initially chilly
temperatures over the Northwest while bringing a period of very
warm to hot weather across the southern half of the West Saturday
onward, connecting with the heat expected to persist over and near
the southern Plains.  Highs may challenge daily records over some
locations across these areas.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 12Z/18Z operational model composite used as the basis of the
updated forecast early in the period transitioned to a blend of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their ensemble means by mid-late period.
 The UKMET/CMC have continued their general trend toward recent
GFS/ECMWF ideas for the storm expected to reach just north of the
northern Plains as of early Friday.  However the UKMET/CMC have
been straying from the other guidance for the ultimate evolution
of trailing shortwave energy initially over the Northwest, pulling
it farther south than consensus.  This trait of those models
contrasts with recent GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF mean trends toward
somewhat less amplitude of the eventual eastern trough aloft and a
stronger upper ridging building back over the southern
Plains--leading to greater persistence of the heat over that
region.  Meanwhile individual models and ensemble members diverge
for details of eastern Pacific shortwave energy pushing into
western North America.  In general the latest GFS runs have leaned
toward bringing lower heights into the West versus most other
guidance but not to an extreme degree versus typical
predictability/error ranges at the time frame of interest.  Also
the new 00Z UKMET bears some similarity to the GFS.  These
shortwave details will be important for determining the coverage
and intensity of precipitation over the Northwest.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Within the broad area of above normal temperatures from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes and Northeast on Friday, the
best potential for some daily records will be across the southern
tier and Great Lakes/Northeast.  Highest anomalies of plus 10-20F
or slightly higher should be across northern areas from Friday
into the weekend.  Meanwhile potential record heat could persist
over/near eastern Texas into next week, and may expand over more
of the southern Plains/South early next week.

The ridge building over the West will lead to a pronounced warming
trend during the weekend, with broad coverage of highs 10-15F
above normal over the southern half of the region by Sunday and
persisting into Tuesday.  This heat could challenge daily record
highs over some southern areas and ultimately increase
temperatures over the southern Plains once again next week.  The
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be chilly on Friday
with highs 5-15F below normal, followed by some moderation.
Shortwaves ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough and
associated surface fronts may produce multiple episodes of
precipitation over the Northwest.  Some of this activity could be
locally moderate/heavy depending on exact details which have low
predictability at this time.

A wavy front extending south from an initial storm system over
southern Canada may hang up over the Upper Midwest through
southern Plains for a time late this week as it awaits the arrival
of dynamics from the Northwest, leading to the possibility of some
moderate to heavy showers and thunderstorms over or just west of
the Mississippi Valley.  Then this front will become more
progressive as upper troughing heads toward and into the East.
Some rainfall along the front could still be fairly intense but
the greater progression may temper maximum totals over the East.
The trailing part of the front should stall and may lift back as a
warm front early next week, potentially serving as a focus for
some convection.  The Southeast upper low that quickly opens up
Friday into Saturday will spread an area of rain into the
Carolinas and areas to the north.  Some localized enhancement will
be possible over the Carolinas/Virginia but rapid opening of the
upper low should tend to decrease the focus of moisture farther
northward.

300 AM EDT Tue May 10 2022

...Lingering blocky pattern to extend record heat from the
Southern Plains/Lower Mississippi Valley to the Midwest/Northeast
late week along with episodes of central U.S. convection and an
emerging onshore rainfall focus to the Carolinas...
...Developing heat threat for California and the Southwest from
the weekend into next week while heat persists eastward over far
southern tier areas...


...Overview...

Guidance continues to show the large scale upper pattern
transitioning from a blocky regime late this week toward an
eastern Pacific trough, western U.S. into High Plains ridge, and
eastern U.S. trough.  A broad area of much above normal
temperatures into late this week from the southern Plains into
Great Lakes/Northeast, with numerous daily records possible, will
eventually moderate over the northern two-thirds of the country as
a wavy front over the Plains (a possible focus for at least some
locally heavy rainfall) pushes farther eastward ahead of the
approaching trough.  Meanwhile an upper low reaching the Southeast
by Friday will quickly open up as it lifts northward, spreading
rainfall into and north from the Carolinas.  The upper ridge
building into/through the West will moderate initially chilly
temperatures over the Northwest while bringing a period of very
warm to hot weather across the southern half of the West Saturday
onward, connecting with the heat expected to persist over and near
the southern Plains.  Highs may challenge daily records over some
locations across these areas.

...Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The 12Z/18Z operational model composite used as the basis of the
updated forecast early in the period transitioned to a blend of
the 18Z GFS/12Z ECMWF and their ensemble means by mid-late period.
 The UKMET/CMC have continued their general trend toward recent
GFS/ECMWF ideas for the storm expected to reach just north of the
northern Plains as of early Friday.  However the UKMET/CMC have
been straying from the other guidance for the ultimate evolution
of trailing shortwave energy initially over the Northwest, pulling
it farther south than consensus.  This trait of those models
contrasts with recent GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF mean trends toward
somewhat less amplitude of the eventual eastern trough aloft and a
stronger upper ridging building back over the southern
Plains--leading to greater persistence of the heat over that
region.  Meanwhile individual models and ensemble members diverge
for details of eastern Pacific shortwave energy pushing into
western North America.  In general the latest GFS runs have leaned
toward bringing lower heights into the West versus most other
guidance but not to an extreme degree versus typical
predictability/error ranges at the time frame of interest.  Also
the new 00Z UKMET bears some similarity to the GFS.  These
shortwave details will be important for determining the coverage
and intensity of precipitation over the Northwest.

...Weather/Threat Highlights...

Within the broad area of above normal temperatures from the
southern Plains through Great Lakes and Northeast on Friday, the
best potential for some daily records will be across the southern
tier and Great Lakes/Northeast.  Highest anomalies of plus 10-20F
or slightly higher should be across northern areas from Friday
into the weekend.  Meanwhile potential record heat could persist
over/near eastern Texas into next week, and may expand over more
of the southern Plains/South early next week.

The ridge building over the West will lead to a pronounced warming
trend during the weekend, with broad coverage of highs 10-15F
above normal over the southern half of the region by Sunday and
persisting into Tuesday.  This heat could challenge daily record
highs over some southern areas and ultimately increase
temperatures over the southern Plains once again next week.  The
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will be chilly on Friday
with highs 5-15F below normal, followed by some moderation.
Shortwaves ejecting from the eastern Pacific upper trough and
associated surface fronts may produce multiple episodes of
precipitation over the Northwest.  Some of this activity could be
locally moderate/heavy depending on exact details which have low
predictability at this time.

...Summer-like heat will expand northward through much of the
Heartland; critical fire danger persists from the Southwest to the
southern High Plains...

...Cold and mountain snows from the West Coast to the northern
Rockies while rounds of heavy rain & thunderstorms will expand

for coastal communities...

As an upper level ridge builds over the Mississippi Valley this
week, summer-like heat today over the central/southern Plains into
the Midwest is expected to expand northward into the northern
Plains and the upper Midwest by Thursday.  Record high
temperatures into the 90s are forecast to be concentrated near the
lower and mid-Mississippi Valley today and Wednesday, shifting
just west of the lower Mississippi Valley on Thursday.  The
combination of the heat and dry conditions will continue to result
in an extensive area of elevated to critical fire weather risk
from northern Arizona to central Oklahoma and Kansas.  Gusty winds
that develop during the day will help fan the fire potential,
especially from the Four-Corners region to the central/southern
High Plains.  Cooler air behind a cold front is forecast to arrive
Wednesday night into early Thursday.  On the other hand, drier air
and gusty winds behind the front will help sustain the risk of
fire across these areas into Thursday.

Throughout the western part of the country, a deep upper level
trough is set to keep anomalously colder temperatures entrenched
along the West Coast.  The coldest areas will be found this
morning in northern and central California where more record cold
temperatures are expected.  Hard Freeze Warnings have been issued
for parts of coastal northern California.  Due to these cold
temperatures, precipitation will fall as snow in parts of the
Shasta, Sierra Nevada, and Bitterroots this afternoon and into
early Tuesday with several inches of accumulation on tap.  During
the next couple of days, a low pressure system is forecast to
slowy develop over the central Rockies as a warm front extend
eastward into the Midwest.  This will result in a gradual
expansion of showers and thunderstorms across the northern Plains
later on Wednesday to early on Thursday.  In the near terms,
clusters of showers and possibly severe storms are expected to
impact mainly the upper Midwest today.

Severe storms will also be possible both Tuesday and Wednesday in
the southern High Plains. A Slight Risk is in place for West Texas
on Tuesday while an expansive Marginal Risk stretches from the Big
Bend of Texas on north to the Black Hills of South Dakota. Farther
east, a strong and large area of high pressure has become wedged
over southeast Canada stretching on south into the Southeast
today. This high pressure will stick around through mid-week
keeping dry conditions in place with plenty of sunshine as well.
However, a lingering surface low off the East Coast will continue
to aid in funneling cool northerly flow down the coast, keeping
much of the I-95 corridor on east to the coast feeling quite cool
by mid-May standards. Some parts of the coast, from New England on
south to the North Carolina Outer Banks, will struggle to get out
of the 60s for highs on Tuesday and Wednesday. These same areas
are also contending with high surf which has led to the issuance
of Coastal Flood Warnings and Advisories for portions of the
Mid-Atlantic coast. Temperatures will rebound to warmer levels in
northern New England first with much of Northeast and Mid-Atlantic
eventually returning to more seasonal temperature regimes the
second half of the week.

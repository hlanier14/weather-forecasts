..Squitieri.. 02/28/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1258 AM CST Mon Feb 28 2022/

...Synopsis...
A dry antecedent airmass will remain in place over much of the Great
Plains, where maximum temperatures will climb into the upper 50s to
lower 60s today. This will result in widespread minimum afternoon RH
of 10-15 percent, though mid/upper-level ridging will favor light
sustained surface winds (generally less than 15 mph) where the
greatest RH reductions are expected.

Dry offshore flow will continue over southern California, where
periods of strong/gusty northeasterly winds will overlap critically
low RH. This will especially be the case over portions of Ventura,
Los Angeles, and Orange Counties -- where wind gusts in excess of 40
mph will be possible over terrain-favored areas. With that said,
high live fuel moisture should generally mitigate the fire-weather
threat, though fire-weather concerns will still exist where the
strong winds/low RH overlap dead fuels. Highlights will not be added
due to the localized nature of this threat.

...Heavy Rainfall Signal Emerging for the Mid-South and Ohio
Valley Sunday/Next Monday...

...Overview...

It remains the case that latest guidance continues to suggest that
a steadily building eastern Pacific upper ridge from late this
week into early next week will help to establish mean troughing
from central Canada through the western U.S.  This general pattern
appears likely to persist beyond the medium range period.  Ahead
of the developing mean trough, eastward progression of an initial
Rockies/High Plains upper ridge will eventually displace an
eastern North American mean trough.  By early next week a broad
zone of southwesterly flow should exist downstream from the mean
trough axis.  Leading energy moving into and through the West will
spread precipitation across the region and then bring a broad area
of various precip types to the central U.S. as its northeastward
ejection supports a Plains through Upper Great Lakes surface
system late Friday through the weekend.  The trailing front may
become a focus for enhanced rainfall over parts of the
east-central U.S. late weekend into early next week.  Below normal
temperatures will spread over an increasing portion of the
western/central U.S. with time while above normal temperatures
become more focused over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance overall shows good agreement and continuity for the
expected large scale pattern evolution. Embedded smaller scale
system variances remains run to run inconsistent though, mainly
into days 5-7. The WPC medium range product suite was accordingly
derived from a composite blend of compatible guidance from the 06
UTC GFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5
(Thursday-Saturday) along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models
(NBM). Blended the best compatible 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble means along with the 13 UTC NBM for days 6/7
(Sunday-next Monday) amid growing forecast spread, albeit in a
pattern with overall better than normal predictability. WPC
product continuity is well maintained in this manner.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The system moving into the West late this week will spread a broad
area of mostly light to moderate (though perhaps locally heavier)
rain and high elevation snow across the region.  Some scattered
precipitation may persist over the West through the rest of the
period depending on shortwave details.  Toward the end of the week
through the weekend precipitation should become more widespread
across the central U.S. as low pressure tracks from the central
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes.  The best potential for
wintry precipitation types continues to extend from the northern
half of the High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually
New England.  Highest probability of significant snowfall
currently exists over the Upper Midwest, just to the northwest of
the surface low track.  There is still considerable uncertainty
over the strength of the system so confidence in the
precipitation/wind specifics is fairly low.  Rainfall of varying
intensity will be possible over the rest of the
central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing cold front.
Guidance is signaling the potential for heavier rainfall within an
area from the southern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by
Saturday night/Sunday into Monday, as the front decelerates while
it becomes more aligned with flow aloft and interacts with low
level Gulf moisture.  The northern fringe of this late-period
moisture shield could contain some wintry weather.

Late this week expect above normal temperatures from the
central/southern Plains through the Southeast, and including back
to the Great Basin/Southwest on Thursday.  Highest anomalies
should be in the plus 15-25F range over the central Plains.  On
the other hand the northern tier may see readings up to 10-20F
below normal.  Colder air overspreading the West starting late
this week will continue to expand into the Plains during the
weekend into early next week, yielding a broad area of
temperatures 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile the
eastern U.S. will see increasing coverage of warmer temperatures
Saturday-Monday, generally plus 10-20F anomalies for highs and up
to plus 20-25F anomalies for morning lows.  Temperatures may
challenge record highs over the Southeast.

...Heavy Rainfall Signal Emerging for the Mid-South and Ohio
Valley Sunday/Next Monday...

...Overview...

It remains the case that latest guidance continues to suggest that
a steadily building eastern Pacific upper ridge from late this
week into early next week will help to establish mean troughing
from central Canada through the western U.S.  This general pattern
appears likely to persist beyond the medium range period.  Ahead
of the developing mean trough, eastward progression of an initial
Rockies/High Plains upper ridge will eventually displace an
eastern North American mean trough.  By early next week a broad
zone of southwesterly flow should exist downstream from the mean
trough axis.  Leading energy moving into and through the West will
spread precipitation across the region and then bring a broad area
of various precip types to the central U.S. as its northeastward
ejection supports a Plains through Upper Great Lakes surface
system late Friday through the weekend.  The trailing front may
become a focus for enhanced rainfall over parts of the
east-central U.S. late weekend into early next week.  Below normal
temperatures will spread over an increasing portion of the
western/central U.S. with time while above normal temperatures
become more focused over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance overall shows good agreement and continuity for the
expected large scale pattern evolution. Embedded smaller scale
system variances remains run to run inconsistent though, mainly
into days 5-7. The WPC medium range product suite was accordingly
derived from a composite blend of compatible guidance from the 06
UTC GFS and 00 UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian days 3-5
(Thursday-Saturday) along with the 13 UTC National Blend of Models
(NBM). Blended the best compatible 06 UTC GFS/GEFS and 00 UTC
ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble means along with the 13 UTC NBM for days 6/7
(Sunday-next Monday) amid growing forecast spread, albeit in a
pattern with overall better than normal predictability. WPC
product continuity is well maintained in this manner.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The system moving into the West late this week will spread a broad
area of mostly light to moderate (though perhaps locally heavier)
rain and high elevation snow across the region.  Some scattered
precipitation may persist over the West through the rest of the
period depending on shortwave details.  Toward the end of the week
through the weekend precipitation should become more widespread
across the central U.S. as low pressure tracks from the central
Plains through the Upper Great Lakes.  The best potential for
wintry precipitation types continues to extend from the northern
half of the High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually
New England.  Highest probability of significant snowfall
currently exists over the Upper Midwest, just to the northwest of
the surface low track.  There is still considerable uncertainty
over the strength of the system so confidence in the
precipitation/wind specifics is fairly low.  Rainfall of varying
intensity will be possible over the rest of the
central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing cold front.
Guidance is signaling the potential for heavier rainfall within an
area from the southern Plains into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by
Saturday night/Sunday into Monday, as the front decelerates while
it becomes more aligned with flow aloft and interacts with low
level Gulf moisture.  The northern fringe of this late-period
moisture shield could contain some wintry weather.

Late this week expect above normal temperatures from the
central/southern Plains through the Southeast, and including back
to the Great Basin/Southwest on Thursday.  Highest anomalies
should be in the plus 15-25F range over the central Plains.  On
the other hand the northern tier may see readings up to 10-20F
below normal.  Colder air overspreading the West starting late
this week will continue to expand into the Plains during the
weekend into early next week, yielding a broad area of
temperatures 5-15F below normal by next Monday.  Meanwhile the
eastern U.S. will see increasing coverage of warmer temperatures
Saturday-Monday, generally plus 10-20F anomalies for highs and up
to plus 20-25F anomalies for morning lows.  Temperatures may
challenge record highs over the Southeast.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST February 28 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the dynamical models in regards to =
the
strength and evolution of mid-level low pressure over the western half of t=
he
contiguous U.S. during week-2. The favored strengthening of this mid-level
feature during the period is expected to result in anomalously cold
temperatures for many areas west of the Mississippi, with an increased risk
for
much below normal temperatures over the Northern Plains towards the middle =
of
the period. Surface low formation favored over the Plains increases the
potential for heavy precipitation over flood prone areas of the east-centra=
l
CONUS and possible heavy snow over parts of the Plains and Midwest. Prevail=
ing
mid-level high pressure forecast for much of the eastern U.S. and Alaska is
favored to bring more tranquil conditions during week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures for portions of the Norther=
n
Rockies and Northern Plains, Thu-Sat, Mar 10-12.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for much of the western and
central CONUS, Tue-Mon, Mar 8-14.

Slight risk of high winds for portions of the southwestern and south-centra=
l
CONUS, Tue-Sat, Mar 8-12.

Slight risk for heavy precipitation for parts of the Ohio, Tennessee, and
Lower
and Middle Mississippi Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and the Southeast,
Tue-Sat, Mar 8-12.

Slight risk for heavy snow for parts of the Central and Northern Plains, an=
d
the Middle and Upper Mississippi Valley, Wed-Fri, Mar 9-11.

Flooding possible across portions of the Ohio, Tennessee, and Lower and Mid=
dle
Mississippi Valleys.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MARCH 03 - MONDAY MARCH 07:

EryZOa--poI$

FOR TUESDAY MARCH 08 - MONDAY MARCH 14: Dynamical models continue to be in
good
agreement favoring a negative Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern with 500=
-
hPa
ridging over the northern Pacific and Alaska and downstream negative mid-le=
vel
height departures overspreading much of the western CONUS during week-2. By
early week-2, both the 0z GEFS and 0z ECMWF ensembles depict the amplificat=
ion
of this latter mid-level height feature, with a positively tilted trough ax=
is
extending southward well into northern Mexico. This mid-level feature is
likely
to be the main driver for increased hazard potential during the period, as =
it
is expected to bring anomalously cold temperatures for much of the western =
two
thirds of the CONUS, promote elevated winds across the Southwest and Southe=
rn
Plains, as well as help initiate surface low formation over the southern CO=
NUS
to increase the risk of heavy precipitation downstream over the Great Plain=
s,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, and the Southeast.



Late in week-1, the Weather Prediction Center's (WPC) surface analysis show=
s
surface high pressure descending southward from Canada in the wake of a lar=
ge,
advancing frontal boundary where anomalously cold temperatures are favored =
to
be in place over the higher elevations of the West and Great Plains by the
start of the period. Reforecast guidance indicates much of this anomalously
cold air to persist into the early portion of week-2, where there is a
widespread coverage of at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures fallin=
g
below the 15th percentile and below freezing. By day 10 (Mar 10), much of t=
his
cold air looks to be reinforced by another round of cold air advection tied=
 to
the amplifying trough forecast aloft and surface low development across the
Great Plains. Increasing probabilities for minimum temperatures falling bel=
ow
the 15th percentile are depicted in both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tool=
s
by
this time, with the highest chances (>40%) indicated over the northern Plai=
ns
during the middle of the period. Thus, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is issued over a broad area of the western and central CONUS f=
or
the entirety of week-2, and a moderate risk of much below normal temperatur=
es
is posted for portions of Montana and the Dakotas where there is also at le=
ast
a 40% for nighttime temperatures falling below 0 degrees F during the middl=
e
of
the period (Mar 10 to 12). Additionally, the strengthening trough favored
aloft
is expected to be conducive for elevated winds across the southwestern and
south-central CONUS. This is supported by strong surface pressure gradients=
 in
the deterministic and ensemble guidance, and reforecast tools through the
middle of period, resulting in the addition of a slight risk of high winds
from
the Four Corners region to the southern Plains. The potential for high wind=
s
over parts of the Southwest and Great Basin increases the risk of wildfires
and
dust storms given low soil moisture content and the widespread severe to
extreme drought conditions currently registered in the region.



With the aforementioned surface low development favored towards the middle =
of
the period, both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles also feature surface high
pressure shifting eastward over the western Atlantic to set up return flow =
and
the advection of Gulf moisture into the southern tier of the CONUS. There i=
s
good multi-model agreement between the raw ensembles and calibrated reforec=
ast
tools showing an increased potential for heavy precipitation over the
south-central and southeastern CONUS to support a corresponding slight risk
area for the region from Mar 8 to 12. A moderate risk of heavy precipitatio=
n
was considered due to robust precipitation signals in the uncalibrated
guidance
by day 10 (Mar 10) over parts of the Mississippi and Tennessee Valley, thou=
gh
this is not supported in the latest reforecast tools which maintain less th=
an
40% chance of 3-day toals exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch through =
the
middle of the period. However, a flooding possible hazard remains issued
extending from over the portions of the Mississippi, Tennessee and Ohio
Valleys
given wet antecedent conditions, ongoing river flooding, and above-normal
precipitation forecast in the region late in week-1.



With cold air advection favored further north across the Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley, increased snowfall is also likely on the backside of th=
e
surface low as it tracks northeastward. While precipitation amounts are
expected to be lower compared to the warm sector, reforecast tools show at
least a 20% chance of 3-day accumulations exceeding the 85th percentile and=
 a
slight risk of heavy snow is posted from the central High Plains to the
Midwest
for Mar 9 to 11. This is also supported by deterministic solutions and
ensemble
guidance depicting increased snowfall accumulations over the highlighted
region.



Over Alaska, amplified mid-level ridiging forecast over much of northern
Pacific and the Bering Sea is expected to lead to unseasonably warm
temperatures with increased onshore flow to promote above-normal precipitat=
ion
throughout much of the Mainland. No precipitation related hazards are poste=
d
as
amounts are not expected to reach hazard thresholds, however the persistenc=
e
of
above-normal temperatures over Alaska bears monitoring as the state approac=
hes
the river ice breakup season later this spring.

Recent heavy rain and snow, along with warming temperatures and
high winds have prompted Avalanche Warnings for portions of the
Washington Cascades and the northern Idaho and northwestern
Montana ranges.  Flood Warning and Watches are also in effect
across portions of Washington and Oregon, where heavy rain and
melting snow are causing excessive runoff and flooding along some
rivers and streams.  Additional heavy precipitation can be
expected across western Washington and northwestern Oregon into
the evening before the focus for heavier precipitation begins to
shift farther south and precipitation rates begin to diminish some
overnight.  However, unsettled weather is forecast to continue
across the Pacific Northwest into the northern Rockies through the
middle of the week as a Pacific system slowly moves onshore.

Father to the south from Central and Southern California to the
central and southern Rockies, dry conditions and above-normal
temperatures can be expected through midweek.

A series of fast-moving systems are expected to bring a wintry mix
across portions of the northern Plains, Great Lakes and Northeast
each day.  Accumulations for snow and ice are expected to be light
with these systems.

Farther to the south, it will feel more like spring. Daytime highs
are forecast to climb 10-30 above normal across most places from
the central and southern Plains to the Mid Atlantic and Southeast
on Tuesday and Wednesday, before colder starts to press south from
the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes later this week.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST Mon Feb 28 2022


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR MARCH 2022

The current state of the El Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo Southern Oscillation (ENS=
O) remains in the
negative phase with the latest weekly observed Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 In=
dex value standing
at
-0.8 degrees Celsius. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the Real-time Multivariat=
e
(RMM) based Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) index has decreased in recent
days,
but still maintains a signal near the Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent.
Composites from this combined ENSO/MJO state for the month of March depicts=
 a
500-hPa flow pattern consistent with the negative phase of the Pacific / No=
rth
American (PNA) teleconnection pattern and similar to that indicated by the
previous March 2022 outlook issued on February 17 (herein referred to as th=
e
mid-month outlook). However, as we close out the month of February, short t=
erm
dynamical model guidance is increasingly relied upon with the official 3-7 =
Day
Outlooks from the Weather Prediction Center (WPC), 8-14 Day Outlooks from t=
he
Climate Prediction Center (CPC), and Weeks 3-4 Outlooks from CPC forming th=
e
backbone of the updated March 2022 outlooks. These outlooks reveal a variab=
le
pattern for the month of March with changeable weather across large swathes=
 of
the country as the month progresses. Dynamical model guidance from the Clim=
ate
Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2), the Global Forecast System (GFS), the
European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and Environment
and
Climate Change Canada (ECCC) clearly indicate this variable pattern. The
consensus of these dynamical models forecast ridging over the western
two-thirds of the Contiguous United States (CONUS) early in the month quick=
ly
being replaced by a deep trough by mid-month with ridging developing
downstream
across the Eastern Seaboard. The CFS and GFS indicate the potential for a m=
ore
zonally oriented pattern across much of the CONUS by the time we close out =
the
month of March. Dynamical model guidance forecasts a strong ridge to build
across much of Alaska during early to mid-March. However, the CFSv2 and GFS
indicate the potential for increased troughing over southeastern parts of t=
he
state towards the end of the month.



The updated March temperature outlooks indicate increased probabilities of
above normal temperatures across much of the eastern and south-central CONU=
S.
The greatest confidence for above normal temperatures is across the Florida
Peninsula, where probabilities exceed 60 percent. This represents an eastwa=
rd
shift in the area of favored above normal temperatures relative to the
mid-month outlook, due to the potential for deep troughing over the western
CONUS by the middle of the month. This potential trough leads to an expansi=
ve
area of favored below normal temperatures across much of the western and
north-central CONUS. Probabilities of above normal temperatures are elevate=
d
upstream across western Alaska as a strong ridge builds during the first ha=
lf
of the month. Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for the Alaska
Panhandle due to the potential for increased troughing during the latter ha=
lf
of the month.



The updated March 2022 precipitation outlook is generally consistent with t=
he
negative phase of ENSO and similar to that depicted in the mid-month outloo=
k.
As a strong trough is forecast to develop across the western two-thirds of =
the
CONUS by mid month, moist flow ahead of it favors above normal precipitatio=
n
for much of the east-central CONUS and eventually to the Northeast. Above
normal precipitation is also favored for the northwestern CONUS, due to an
active pattern predicted early in the month coupled with likely mean cyclon=
ic
flow for the month as a whole. A tilt in the odds toward below normal
precipitation is indicated across much of the Southern Tier of the CONUS,
consistent with the consensus of dynamical model guidance and with La Ni=EF=
=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa
composites. Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced for much =
of
western and central Alaska, due to the potential for prevailing southwester=
ly
mid-level flow. As a ridge builds across the Mainland early to mid-month,
below
normal precipitation is favored downstream of the ridge axis across the
Panhandle.

The March 2022 outlooks are issued against the backdrop of an ongoing
double-dip La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa and an emerging Madden Julian Oscillati=
on (MJO) event. The
Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo 3.4 index for the period November-December-January 20=
21-22 stood at -1.0
degrees Celsius, which is similar in magnitude to that observed during the
2020-21 winter season. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the Real-time Multivaria=
te
(RMM) based MJO index has increased during early February, with an enhancem=
ent
of the intraseasonal signal noted across the Indian Ocean. Natural analog
composites derived from the current El Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDo Southern Oscil=
lation (ENSO) and
MJO
states depict a 500-hPa flow pattern for the month of March consistent with
the
negative phase of the Pacific / North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern=
.
These composites indicate anomalous ridging over the Aleutians and adjacent
areas of the North Pacific, troughing across the northwestern CONUS, and
expansive ridging across most of the eastern and south-central CONUS.
Dynamical
guidance from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) and North America
Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) show very good agreement with the natural ENSO/=
MJO
analogs in forecasting a negative PNA-like pattern for the month of March.
This
excellent consistency between dynamical and statistical guidance leads to
higher than normal confidence in the March 2022 outlooks.



Statistical and dynamical guidance are in good agreement in favoring above
normal temperatures across most of the eastern and central CONUS.
Probabilities
of above normal temperatures exceed 60 percent for parts of the Southern
Plains, where warm signals from dynamical model guidance are the strongest.
High probabilities of above normal temperatures (greater than 50 percent)
extend eastward to most of the Eastern Seaboard and northward to the easter=
n
Great Lakes region, where MJO composites depict a strong warm signal.
Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored for the northwestern CONU=
S
and southeastern Alaska, consistent with the negative phase of the PNA. Bel=
ow
normal Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) also played a role in tilting the od=
ds
toward below normal temperatures across much of the south coast of Alaska.



ENSO natural analogs and dynamical model guidance are in good agreement in
depicting a wet signal for much of the east-central CONUS stretching from t=
he
Great Lakes region southward across the Ohio and Middle Mississippi valleys=
.
MJO composites as well as multi-model guidance from the C3S also support a
westward expansion of the wet signal, to include much of the Upper Mississi=
ppi
Valley. Probabilities of above normal precipitation are greater than 50
percent
from southern Michigan to western areas of the Ohio Valley, where ENSO
composites and C3S guidance depict the strongest wet signals. Conversely,
below
normal precipitation is favored from the Southwest to the Central Plains as
well as for much of the Southeast, typical of La Ni=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDa cond=
itions. ENSO
composites and dynamical model guidance generally support above normal
precipitation for the northwestern CONUS. However, uncertainty is high acro=
ss
the West Coast, as MJO Composites favor a wetter solution farther to the so=
uth
across southern California and a drier solution for the Pacific Northwest, =
in
opposition to dynamical model guidance. The official March outlook depicts
slightly elevated odds of above normal precipitation for the northwestern
CONUS, consistent with the majority of dynamical model solutions. Equal
chances
of above, near, and below normal precipitation are indicated farther to the
south across Southern California, where dynamical and statistical guidance
conflict. ENSO/MJO composites depict enhanced westerly or southwesterly flo=
w
across western Mainland Alaska, suggestive of an active pattern. Therefore,
above normal precipitation is favored for much of western Alaska, with supp=
ort
from C3S guidance. Statistical and dynamical model guidance are in good
agreement in depicting a dry solution downstream across southeastern Alaska=
,
where below normal precipitation is favored.

NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Mon February 28 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 06 - 10 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. A strong ridge and associated abov=
e
normal 500-hPa heights are predicted across the Northeast Pacific, extendin=
g
north to Alaska. An enhanced trough is predicted over the western and centr=
al
CONUS with below normal 500-hPa heights. Downstream, ridging is forecast to
persist over the eastern CONUS, leading to predicted above normal heights
there.

Increased chances for above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska,
associated with predicted above normal 500-hPa heights during the period.
There
are enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures across the western =
and
much of central CONUS beneath amplified troughing. Above normal temperature=
s
are likely for the eastern CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains due to
predicted ridging and above normal heights.

The potential for several storm systems tracking ahead of a mean trough wes=
t
of
Mainland Alaska favors increased probabilities for above normal precipitati=
on
for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. The predicted ridge over the Northea=
st
Pacific favors enhanced odds of below normal precipitation across the Alask=
a
Panhandle and the West Coast. Several storm systems are forecast to develop
ahead of the western trough and track east across the country, enhancing th=
e
likelihood of above normal precipitation for most of the central and easter=
n
CONUS.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 08 - 14 2022

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern over the Northeast Pacific an=
d
CONUS is forecast to be similar to that during the 6-10 day period.

Above normal temperatures are favored for Alaska associated with mean ridgi=
ng
predicted over the state. Conversely, below normal temperatures are favored
for
most of the western and central CONUS associated with troughing. Near to ab=
ove
normal temperatures are favored for the eastern CONUS, consistent with
predicted above normal 500-hPa heights.

An active pattern is likely to continue into week-2 across much of Alaska
underneath enhanced southwesterly mid-level flow, leading to elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation. Below normal precipitation is
most
likely across the Alaska Panhandle and the west coast of the CONUS, associa=
ted
with a strong ridging forecast off the West Coast. Below normal precipitati=
on
is also favored for parts of the Southern High Plains consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Ahead of the mean trough predicted over the
western and central CONUS, above normal precipitation is favored across the
Central and Northern Rockies eastward to Mississippi Valley and the eastern

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=
red
on Day 11, 10% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of
Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Yesterday's 12=
z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, off=
set
by some disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 17.

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The fire-weather threat will generally be limited across the CONUS
today, as expansive mid/upper-level ridging favors light surface
winds where the most substantial RH reductions are expected. The one
exception will be over portions of Missouri and eastern Kansas,
where modestly breezy surface winds could briefly overlap
near-critical RH atop very dry fuels during the afternoon. However,
these conditions look too marginal and localized for Elevated
highlights at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1235 AM CST Tue Mar 01 2022

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An amplified mid/upper-level ridge will encompass the western
two-thirds of the CONUS, where a dry antecedent airmass will remain
in place. As maximum temperatures climb into the middle/upper 70s
across the central and southern Plains, widespread minimum RH
reductions of 10-15 percent will develop. Along the northern
periphery of the ridge, a midlevel speed maximum will move
southeastward across the Missouri Valley, supporting the potential
for 15-20 mph wind gusts across the central Plains into parts of the
Middle MS Valley. This could result in locally elevated conditions,
though the lack of a tighter surface pressure gradient casts
uncertainty on the fire-weather threat. Therefore, no Elevated
highlights will be added at this time, though trends will be
monitored.

Extended Forecast Discussion

...Heavy snow potential over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas.  A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England.  Most guidance
shows a second system developing along the trailing front whose
slow movement due to alignment with southwesterly mean flow aloft
late weekend into early next week could make it a focus for
significant rainfall farther south.  Below normal temperatures
will settle over much of the western and central U.S. while above
normal readings from the central/southern Plains into the
Southeast late this week become more pronounced over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within what continues to be a consistently agreeable pattern from
a multi-day mean perspective, operational models continue to show
some spread and variability for details and are still in the
process of refining some of the specifics up to 5-6 days out in
time.  There are some common themes though.  Latest runs are
suggesting that the leading shortwave reaching the West by Friday
may be in the form of a compact closed low that crosses California
and then ejects rapidly northeastward (with mixed signals for
being open or closed at various valid times).  Then current
consensus shows the next piece of energy dropping into the mean
trough as a closed low that also tracks through the West and
continues northeastward.  Models and ensembles have maintained
reasonable continuity in having the leading shortwave support
Plains into Upper Great Lakes low pressure from late Friday into
Sunday but with a lot of variability for strength in the Great
Lakes.  Over the past couple days there had been some significant
waffling in the GFS/ECMWF between stronger and weaker solutions
but latest runs including those from the 00Z cycle are in the
middle to deeper half of the envelope.  Guidance still signals
potential for some weakening beyond the Great Lakes as the energy
aloft may shear out to some degree.  Latest GFS/ECMWF runs and
their means indicate that the second ejecting western impulse may
lead to another wave that reaches the Great Lakes or Ohio Valley
on a track farther southeast than the first one and only about a
day behind.  Such a wave is less defined in the 00Z CMC.  Details
of energy behind the second feature become increasingly uncertain,
as seen in differences among the operational models as well as
broadening spread among ensemble members.

The updated forecast started with primary emphasis on the 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF with lesser input from the 12Z CMC/UKMET for about
the first half of the period, to reflect an intermediate solution
among the general clustering that existed for the two primary
upper systems and corresponding surface reflection.  The greater
uncertainty with details of trailing flow led to trending the
blend toward half models/half means by day 7 Tuesday.  This
approach yielded generally modest refinements to continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The sequence of two upper systems moving into and through the West
from late this week through the weekend should spread rain and
higher elevation snow across the region.  Most activity should be
light to moderate but some locally heavier totals will be
possible, primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the central
Rockies.  With much lower confidence, another system that may drop
southeastward into the Northwest early next week may produce some
light to moderate precipitation.

Meanwhile weather will become more active across many areas to the
east of the Rockies from the end of this week into early next
week.  The first western feature should generate surface low
pressure that tracks from the central Plains through Upper Great
Lakes during the weekend.  The best potential for wintry
precipitation types still extends from the northern half of the
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur).  Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains over the Upper Midwest, just to the
northwest of the surface low track.  Latest guidance suggests the
storm could be strong enough to produce some brisk winds but model
behavior thus far offers potential for additional changes in the
forecast.  Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible over the
rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing cold
front.  Then there is a continued signal for heavier rainfall
potential generally within an area from the southeastern Plains
into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into
early next week.  This threat corresponds to slower progression of
the trailing front as it becomes more aligned with flow aloft,
interaction with low level Gulf moisture, and the possibility of
another wave that would provide added rainfall focus.  The
northwestern fringe of this moisture shield should contain some
wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat southeast of the
first episode.  Specifics will depend on lower-confidence wave
details.

Colder air overspreading the western and central U.S. late this
week into the weekend and persisting through at least early next
week should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F
below normal.  Some pockets of colder anomalies are possible over
the northern/central High Plains.  Leading warm sector air,
initially focused over the central Plains and then becoming more
pronounced over the East, will contain readings that are 10-25F
above normal with localized higher anomalies possible for morning
lows.  Numerous locations over the Southeast may challenge daily
record highs from the weekend into early next week, while record
warm lows may extend farther northward.

...Heavy snow potential over the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and
possibly into northern New England during the weekend...

...Heavy rainfall potential from the Mid-Lower Mississippi Valley
into Tennessee/Ohio Valleys late weekend into early next week...

...Overview...

Models and ensemble means continue to show the establishment of a
positively tilted mean trough aloft from Canada into the western
U.S., between a building eastern Pacific ridge and another ridge
that migrates across the Gulf of Mexico into the Bahamas.  A
leading impulse reaching the West by the start of the period early
Friday and another feature arriving close behind will bring
precipitation to portions of the West, followed by a broad area of
precipitation to the east of the Rockies as two potential systems
track into the Great Lakes/Ohio Valley.  The first system should
bring greater snowfall potential to the Upper Midwest/Upper Great
Lakes and to some degree northern New England.  Most guidance
shows a second system developing along the trailing front whose
slow movement due to alignment with southwesterly mean flow aloft
late weekend into early next week could make it a focus for
significant rainfall farther south.  Below normal temperatures
will settle over much of the western and central U.S. while above
normal readings from the central/southern Plains into the
Southeast late this week become more pronounced over the East.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

Within what continues to be a consistently agreeable pattern from
a multi-day mean perspective, operational models continue to show
some spread and variability for details and are still in the
process of refining some of the specifics up to 5-6 days out in
time.  There are some common themes though.  Latest runs are
suggesting that the leading shortwave reaching the West by Friday
may be in the form of a compact closed low that crosses California
and then ejects rapidly northeastward (with mixed signals for
being open or closed at various valid times).  Then current
consensus shows the next piece of energy dropping into the mean
trough as a closed low that also tracks through the West and
continues northeastward.  Models and ensembles have maintained
reasonable continuity in having the leading shortwave support
Plains into Upper Great Lakes low pressure from late Friday into
Sunday but with a lot of variability for strength in the Great
Lakes.  Over the past couple days there had been some significant
waffling in the GFS/ECMWF between stronger and weaker solutions
but latest runs including those from the 00Z cycle are in the
middle to deeper half of the envelope.  Guidance still signals
potential for some weakening beyond the Great Lakes as the energy
aloft may shear out to some degree.  Latest GFS/ECMWF runs and
their means indicate that the second ejecting western impulse may
lead to another wave that reaches the Great Lakes or Ohio Valley
on a track farther southeast than the first one and only about a
day behind.  Such a wave is less defined in the 00Z CMC.  Details
of energy behind the second feature become increasingly uncertain,
as seen in differences among the operational models as well as
broadening spread among ensemble members.

The updated forecast started with primary emphasis on the 18Z
GFS/12Z ECMWF with lesser input from the 12Z CMC/UKMET for about
the first half of the period, to reflect an intermediate solution
among the general clustering that existed for the two primary
upper systems and corresponding surface reflection.  The greater
uncertainty with details of trailing flow led to trending the
blend toward half models/half means by day 7 Tuesday.  This
approach yielded generally modest refinements to continuity.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The sequence of two upper systems moving into and through the West
from late this week through the weekend should spread rain and
higher elevation snow across the region.  Most activity should be
light to moderate but some locally heavier totals will be
possible, primarily from the Sierra Nevada into the central
Rockies.  With much lower confidence, another system that may drop
southeastward into the Northwest early next week may produce some
light to moderate precipitation.

Meanwhile weather will become more active across many areas to the
east of the Rockies from the end of this week into early next
week.  The first western feature should generate surface low
pressure that tracks from the central Plains through Upper Great
Lakes during the weekend.  The best potential for wintry
precipitation types still extends from the northern half of the
High Plains into the Upper Great Lakes and eventually New England
(where a changeover to rain may occur).  Highest probability of
significant snowfall remains over the Upper Midwest, just to the
northwest of the surface low track.  Latest guidance suggests the
storm could be strong enough to produce some brisk winds but model
behavior thus far offers potential for additional changes in the
forecast.  Rainfall of varying intensity will be possible over the
rest of the central/east-central U.S. ahead of the trailing cold
front.  Then there is a continued signal for heavier rainfall
potential generally within an area from the southeastern Plains
into the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys by Saturday night/Sunday into
early next week.  This threat corresponds to slower progression of
the trailing front as it becomes more aligned with flow aloft,
interaction with low level Gulf moisture, and the possibility of
another wave that would provide added rainfall focus.  The
northwestern fringe of this moisture shield should contain some
wintry weather, likely along an axis somewhat southeast of the
first episode.  Specifics will depend on lower-confidence wave
details.

Colder air overspreading the western and central U.S. late this
week into the weekend and persisting through at least early next
week should yield a broad area of temperatures that are 5-15F
below normal.  Some pockets of colder anomalies are possible over
the northern/central High Plains.  Leading warm sector air,
initially focused over the central Plains and then becoming more
pronounced over the East, will contain readings that are 10-25F
above normal with localized higher anomalies possible for morning
lows.  Numerous locations over the Southeast may challenge daily
record highs from the weekend into early next week, while record
warm lows may extend farther northward.

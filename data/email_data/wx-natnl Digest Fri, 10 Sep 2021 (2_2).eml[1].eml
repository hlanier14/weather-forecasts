...Potential Heavy Rain Threat for Western Gulf Region early next
week...


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Fast, quasi-zonal flow across the northern tier of the U.S. will
keep fronts progressive and the majority of the CONUS in a drier
weather pattern. The latest suite of 12z/18z guidance shows good
enough agreement days 3-4 (Mon-Tues) to warrant a purely
deterministic model blend (favored more heavily towards the
ECMWF/GFS). After mid-week though, some timing and intensity
differences begin to arise, especially with a pair of shortwaves
entering the West Coast on Wednesday and again Friday. The 00z CMC
is more amplified than the ECMWF and GFS and thus, slower with the
first shortwave, but is flatter and faster with the second. So by
late period, it quickly gets out of phase from the better
consensus. The ECMWF and GFS are more consistent with the ensemble
means, but also continue to show some run to run variability. As a
result, the WPC forecast leans more towards the ensemble means the
second half of the period with minor contributions from the ECMWF
and GFS just for a little added system definition. This maintains
good WPC continuity for days 3-6, with some slightly faster
frontal speed.

In the western Gulf of Mexico, a broad tropical plume of moisture
associated with a weak disturbance will gradually lift
north-northwest toward the TX/LA coasts late this weekend and into
early/middle of next week. There remains considerable uncertainty
in the potential strength, development, and track of this feature
but the latest guidance is in reasonable agreement for the
potential of heavy rainfall along the immediate coasts that could
reach several inches or more over the multi-day period. The
National Hurricane Center is currently monitoring this disturbance
for possible development over the coming days.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

The eventual track and evolution of a tropical disturbance in the
western Gulf late this weekend into the early/middle portions of
next week may bring multiple rounds of heavy rainfall along the
immediate Texas and southwest Louisiana coasts. Several inches of
rainfall is possible over multiple days and this could lead to
some flooding concerns, especially in areas that have already seen
above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks. Otherwise,
mostly lighter rainfall will follow frontal passages through the
central and northeastern parts of the CONUS with some potential
for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts. Temperatures
across the Western and northern tiers should be near or below
normal, while periods of above normal temperatures shift across
the Southwest/Central U.S. into the East ahead of a couple frontal
passages. Expect the western Gulf Coast to be below normal through
much of next week as well associated with clouds and ample
tropical moisture.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, strengthening cyclogenesis is forecast across the
northern Plains. As a result, increased surface flow is forecast
across portions of the central and southern Plains. Currently, fuels
are not quite to critical thresholds and thus an elevated
delineation has not been added. However, an increase in initial
attack may be seen across portions of the Texas Panhandle,
western/central Oklahoma, much of Kansas and far southern Nebraska,
where surface winds of 20 to 25 mph are expected with relative
humidity of 15 to 20 percent.

The only other area of concern could be portions of southeast
Wyoming into the NE Panhandle. ERCs are near the 90th percentile in
this area and stronger northwest surface flow is expected as the
surface low deepens. However, cooler air is also forecast to move
into the region, and thus relative humidity is currently forecast to
stay above 25 percent. However, if drier surface conditions appear
more likely, an elevated delineation may need to be added at a later
time.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0110 AM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...Synopsis...
A large upper-level ridge will persist across the Southwest on
Friday with a large amplitude upper-level trough in the eastern
CONUS and a compact shortwave trough across the Northwest.
Increasing mid-level flow is expected across the northern Great
Basin and portions of the Northwest ahead of the aforementioned
shortwave trough. This will lead to some strengthening downslope
flow in the lee of the Sierra in northwest Nevada.

Farther east, weak lee cyclogenesis is forecast in western South
Dakota during the afternoon with a strengthening pressure gradient
across Wyoming. Westerly winds are forecast to increase to around 15
to 20 mph across central and eastern Wyoming into far southwest
South Dakota where relative humidity is forecast to be around 15 to
20 percent.

Scattered thunderstorms are expected across much of the Great Basin
and Northwest. PWAT values are quite high, especially across
Northeast Oregon, northern Idaho, and eastern Washington, but
farther south, PWAT values are forecast between 0.75 and 1 inch.
This would generally promote more wet than dry storms. However, the
stronger tropospheric flow will lead to storm motions in excess of
30 mph which should increase the chance for dry thunderstorms in a
region with critically dry fuels.

...Mid-September heat wave in the Nation's Heartland lasting into
the upcoming weekend...

...Red Flag Warnings and Elevated Fire Weather Conditions in parts
of the Northwest and eastern Wyoming; wildfire smoke to become
widespread throughout the Plains...

...Showers and storms in Florida today, followed by the central
Plains and Great Lakes Saturday; keeping a watchful eye on
tropical activity in the western Gulf of Mexico this weekend...

A generally tranquil weather pattern is in store across the
majority of the Lower 48 to close out the work-week and kickoff
the upcoming weekend. This is due to a pair of strengthening upper
level ridges of high pressure: one over the Southeast and one in
the Southwest. There are still a handful of hazards of note in the
short term across the country, however. The first is stifling heat
from the Rockies to the Plains. High temps today look to soar into
the triple digits for parts of the central and northern High
Plains. High temperature anomalies are forecast to range between
15-25F above normal with quite a few locations potentially tying
or breaking daily record highs. Plus, much of the western third of
the country will start today on a mild note with many daily record
warm minimum temps possible. On Saturday, the core of the hottest
temperatures versus normal shift a little farther east into the
central Plains and Midwest where more daily record warm highs and
lows are possible. The coolest regions through Saturday night are
forecast to take shape along the East Coast and in the Pacific
Northwest. However, after a seasonally cool and comfortable
Friday, temperatures will warm-up throughout the weekend along the
East Coast, culminating in the return of typical summer-time
warmth in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast by Sunday.

The second hazard involves favorable fire weather conditions for
parts of the West. Wildfires continue to rage, producing large
plumes of smoke overspreading the West and the Nation's Heartland.
Some locations have Air Quality Alerts in place over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, the northern Rockies, and central Rockies.
There is also the expectation for breezy winds and dry
thunderstorms in parts of the Northwest, prompting the SPC to
issue a couple Elevated Risks for fire weather conditions today.
Red Flag Warnings are in place for much of Northern California,
central Oregon, and as far east as eastern Wyoming.

The third hazard deals with areas of precipitation through early
morning Sunday. The first is in the Northwest where much above
normal atmospheric moisture content aloft and an approaching upper
level disturbance should trigger numerous showers and
thunderstorms. Some thunderstorms could produce locally heavy
downpours and may result in flash flooding, especially in burn
scar areas. There are Marginal Risks for both severe weather and
Excessive Rainfall for portions of the Northwest today. Also, a
frontal boundary draped over Florida will lead to daily rounds of
showers and storms in the Sunshine State, while a passing frontal
system Saturday potentially brings strong-to-severe thunderstorms
from the central High Plains to the Great Lakes. Lastly, a
tropical disturbance near the Yucatan Peninsula has a 60% chance
of development over the next 5 days in the Bay of Campeche and
northwestern Gulf of Mexico. Interests along the western Gulf
Coast should monitor this tropical feature closely as it could
bring significant rainfall totals to the region beginning Sunday
and lasting into the first half of next week.

300 PM EST Sat Jan 15 2022

Valid 00Z Sun Jan 16 2022 - 00Z Tue Jan 18 2022

...A deep low pressure system will bring widespread snow and ice
as well as strong winds up the interior eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday...

...Severe thunderstorms could impact the Florida Panhandle tonight
into Sunday morning...

...Some heavy rain, strong thunderstorms and high winds can be
expected to impact the coastal sections of the entire East Coast
Sunday into Monday...

A low pressure system continues to develop this afternoon over the
Deep South.  Arctic air settling through much of the central and
eastern U.S. will work in concert with this dynamic system to
bring widespread and significant snow and ice up the Eastern
Seaboard on Sunday into Monday.  In the mean time, rain and some
thunderstorms are expanding across the Deep South to the Gulf
Coast ahead of the low.  The vigorous dynamics associated with the
intensifying storm are expected to trigger strong thunderstorms,
some of which could become severe, as they sweep across the
Florida Panhandle tonight into Sunday morning ahead of a strong
cold front.  Meanwhile, cold air wrapping around the north side of
the low is changing rain to snow from Arkansas eastward into the
Tennessee Valley.  This area of wintry precipitation is expected
to expand and overspread the interior eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday.  Highest snowfall totals should be along the spine of the
Appalachians as well as across the lower Great Lakes as the storm
center is forecast to track up the Piedmont sections of the East
Coast.

Meanwhile, a boundary over Central Canada will move into the Upper
Midwest by Sunday. The system will produce light snow over parts
of the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Upper Great Lakes for
Sunday and begin to wane by Monday morning. The snow will result
in reduced visibility and hazardous driving conditions.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EST Sat January 15 2022

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

POTENTIAL IMPACTS
-----------------

  * A TSUNAMI IS A SERIES OF WAVES. THE TIME BETWEEN WAVE CRESTS
    CAN VARY FROM 5 MINUTES TO AN HOUR. THE HAZARD MAY PERSIST
    FOR MANY HOURS OR LONGER AFTER THE INITIAL WAVE.

  * IMPACTS CAN VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM ONE SECTION OF COAST TO
    THE NEXT DUE TO LOCAL BATHYMETRY AND THE SHAPE AND ELEVATION
    OF THE SHORELINE.

  * IMPACTS CAN ALSO VARY DEPENDING UPON THE STATE OF THE TIDE AT
    THE TIME OF THE MAXIMUM TSUNAMI WAVES.

  * PERSONS CAUGHT IN THE WATER OF A TSUNAMI MAY DROWN... BE
    CRUSHED BY DEBRIS IN THE WATER... OR BE SWEPT OUT TO SEA.

  * THE FOLLOWING ARE TSUNAMI WAVE OBSERVATIONS FROM COASTAL

...A deep low pressure system will bring widespread snow and ice
as well as strong winds up the interior eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday...

...Severe thunderstorms could impact the Florida Panhandle tonight
into Sunday morning...

...Some heavy rain, strong thunderstorms and high winds can be
expected to impact the coastal sections of the entire East Coast
Sunday into Monday...

A low pressure system continues to develop this afternoon over the
Deep South.  Arctic air settling through much of the central and
eastern U.S. will work in concert with this dynamic system to
bring widespread and significant snow and ice up the Eastern
Seaboard on Sunday into Monday.  In the mean time, rain and some
thunderstorms are expanding across the Deep South to the Gulf
Coast ahead of the low.  The vigorous dynamics associated with the
intensifying low are expected to trigger strong thunderstorms,
some of which could become severe, as they sweep across the
Florida Panhandle tonight into Sunday morning ahead of a strong
cold front.  Meanwhile, cold air wrapping around the north side of
the low is changing rain to snow from Arkansas eastward into the
Tennessee Valley.  This area of wintry precipitation is expected
to expand and overspread the interior eastern U.S. Sunday into
Monday.  Highest snowfall totals should be along the spine of the
Appalachians as well as across the lower Great Lakes as the storm
center is forecast to track up the Piedmont sections of the East
Coast.  The most significant icing is expected over the Piedmont
section of the Carolinas on Sunday.  Farther north from the
Mid-Atlantic up through New England, precipitation is forecast to
begin as snow before changing over to ice/sleet and eventually
rain with approach of the storm center.  As the low pressure
system intensifies further, the winds are expected to increase
through much of the eastern U.S.  Near the coast, a period of
heavy rain, strong thunderstorms together with an increasing
threat of high winds can be expected to move up the entire East
Coast Sunday into Monday with the passage of the storm center.
The precipitation should end as snow across the Mid-Atlantic early
on Monday as the storm reaches peak intensity and heads toward New
England, where the wintry weather and strong winds will continue
into Monday evening.  Meanwhile, light snow will linger along the
western slopes of the Appalachians.

Over the northern Plains into the upper Great Lakes, a cold front
dipping into the area from southern Canada will deliver some light
snow on Sunday into Monday.  Elsewhere, relatively quiet
conditions will prevail for the remainder of the country outside
of the big storm system over the East Coast.

   COLUMBIA FROM THE CAL./MEXICO BORDER  TO NORTH VANCOUVER

If you are located in this coastal area, move off the
beach and out of harbors and marinas.

Tsunami advisories mean that a tsunami capable of producing
strong currents or waves dangerous to persons in or very near
the water is expected or is already occurring.  Areas in the
advisory should not expect widespread inundation.  Tsunamis
are a series of waves dangerous many hours after initial
arrival time.  The first wave may not be the largest.

At 827 PM Pacific Standard Time on January 14 an earthquake with
preliminary magnitude 1.0 occurred
near the Tonga Islands.

The tsunami advisory will remain in effect until further notice.

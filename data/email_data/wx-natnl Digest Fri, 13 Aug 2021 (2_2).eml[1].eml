Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0144 AM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
Mid-level ridging over the Great Basin and southwest will intensify
though the day as a broad trough moves east across the northern US.
Moist monsoonal flow will continue to transport moisture northward
beneath the ridge across the Great Basin and Pacific Northwest.
Widely scattered thunderstorms are expected by early afternoon, with
the chance for isolated dry lightning strikes.

...Great Basin and Pacific Northwest...
00z regional soundings and surface obs show mid-level monsoon
moisture in place above warm and dry surface conditions across much
of northern California and southern Oregon and into northern Nevada.
As moisture advection continues beneath the strengthening ridge,
PWAT values will approach 1 inch by early afternoon. Strong heating
will initiate thunderstorms across the higher terrain by early
afternoon. Warm and dry sub-cloud layers will favor isolated dry
strikes over dry fuels, with a risk for lightning ignitions.

Farther north across the Cascades, weak onshore flow along the
western edge of the ridge will transport moisture inland across
Washington and Oregon. Very warm surface conditions and steepening
mid-level lapse rates will result in significant instability in the
higher terrain. While surface conditions will remain unfavorable for
thunderstorms, warm and unstable conditions may result in
plume-dominated fire activity through the afternoon and evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0145 AM CDT Fri Aug 13 2021

Valid 141200Z - 151200Z

...Synopsis...
Ridging across the western US will continue to strengthen ahead of a
developing Pacific trough. Increasing moisture across the Great
Basin and Pacific Northwest will support thunderstorm chances over
dry fuels. Elsewhere across the CONUS, relatively weak flow aloft
will limit critical fire potential.

...Pacific Northwest Thunder...
Similar to the last several days, monsoon moisture advection beneath
a ridge centered over the Great Basin will support widely scattered
thunderstorm development across the higher terrain by early
afternoon. Warm temperatures and dry surface conditions will favor
dry storms with little accumulating precipitation. Favorable
buoyancy for charge separation should result in isolated dry
lightning strikes over dry fuels through the afternoon and evening.

...Great Basin Thunder...
Isolated thunderstorms will likely develop by early afternoon at the
nose of the deeper moisture across the southern Great Basin. Despite
PWAT values near 1 inch, strong northeasterly mid-level flow along
the bottom side of the building ridge will support relatively fast
storm motions, leaving little residence time for storms to produce
significant precipitation accumulations. Given the dry fuels in
place, a risk for lightning ignitions is expected with isolated,
mostly dry, thunderstorms.

Heavy rain likely for portions of the Southeast as Tropical Storm
Fred moves northward after landfall

...Pattern Overview...

A welcomed pattern change arrives by early next week for the
western U.S. as the upper ridge breaks down and a trough builds in
across the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies, heralding the
end of the ongoing heat wave.  Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Fred will
likely be weakening as the storm moves inland across the Southeast
U.S., bringing heavy rain along its path.  Upper level ridging
will likely build back in across the Gulf Coast region by the
middle to end of the week.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Models and ensemble means are in very good overall agreement on
the pattern change expected across the north-central U.S. through
the beginning of the week.  The 12Z/00Z CMC differs some with
lower 500mb heights across the Great Lakes and Midwest compared to
the UKMET/GFS/ECMWF, and it is slower with the passage of the
trough across the Rockies late in the week.  It is also worth
noting that the GFS is considerably stronger with a potential
tropical disturbance near the Bahamas by next Friday, and is not
supported by the other guidance.  In terms of T.S. Fred, the UKMET
is a bit slower than the model consensus, the ECMWF slightly left,
and the GFS weaker overall after the system makes landfall.

The WPC medium-range package was based on a blend of the 12Z
ECMWF/EC mean, 18Z GFS/GEFS, and some contributions from the 12Z
UKMET and previous WPC continuity, with greater weighting towards
the ensemble means by Thursday and Friday.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The ongoing heat wave over the Northwest is expected to be over by
Monday with temperatures returning to near normal levels.  Some
portions of the Northern Rockies and adjacent portions of the
northern Plains could be 10 to 20 degrees below normal next
Tuesday into Wednesday.  High are expected to be above normal
ahead of the cold front across the northern Plains on Monday,
followed by more pleasant readings by midweek.

Tropical moisture is expected to lift northward across interior
portions of the Southeast and southern Appalachians after Fred
makes landfall, potentially interacting with a stalled frontal
boundary and terrain enhancement. Exact locations of heaviest
rainfall depends on the eventual track of Fred, and this is
subject to additional changes in future forecasts.

Elsewhere, monsoon activity over the Desert Southwest should
increase and spread northward, again bringing a localized flash
flood risk.  Moisture should stream northward ahead of the
incoming trough into the Northwest, with a potential for moderate
to heavy rainfall emerging over parts of the northern Rockies/high
Plains on Tuesday, with organized and enhanced rainfall then
focusing along the cold front as it advances across the Northern
Plains Tuesday into Wednesday.

...Monsoonal thunderstorms expected in the Southwest through the
end of the week...

...Rounds of thunderstorms likely along and ahead of a front from
the Central Plains to Ohio/Tennessee Valleys to the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic...

...Fred is forecast to impact much of Florida with heavy rain as
it crosses the Keys on Saturday...

...Oppressive heat continues across the Northwest, Eastern
Seaboard, and south-central CONUS...

A busy weather pattern is in place through the weekend as multiple
features set up to the south of a slow-moving upper-level trough
stretching from central Canada into the north-central U.S. One
concern over the next few days is for heavy rain and flooding
potential in the Southwest as monsoonal moisture continues to flow
into the region. Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in place
for much of Arizona and New Mexico and into Far West Texas through
Saturday, along with Flash Flood Watches.

Farther east, as the aforementioned upper trough edges eastward,
at the surface it will push a cold front eastward across the
northeastern quadrant of the country while meandering slowly
around the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley. As moisture
flows into the front, it should provide a focus for rain and
thunderstorms, with both severe weather and flash flooding as
possible threats. Today, the greatest chances for severe weather
look to be on the back end of the front in the Central High
Plains, as well as over Kentucky, with Slight Risks delineated by
the Storm Prediction Center. Isolated flash floods are also
possible today over a large Marginal Risk area stretching from
Oklahoma north and eastward toward the Mid-South, Ohio Valley,
Great Lakes, and Mid-Atlantic. Then on Saturday, heavy rain looks
to focus over portions of the Mid-Atlantic, and especially given
the wet antecedent conditions, scattered flash floods are possible
and a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall is in place. A few severe
thunderstorms could also occur.

What is currently Tropical Depression Fred is expected to
restrengthen into a Tropical Storm later today as it tracks
northwestward. It is forecast to cross the Florida Keys on
Saturday and then move into the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and should
spread tropical rains to the Florida Peninsula today and through
the weekend. The heavy downpours could result in flooding/flash
flooding issues, and Marginal to Slight Risks increase in size
over the state over the next few days.

The ongoing heat will also be a hazard during the short range
period across multiple regions. First, the Northwest can expect
continued record-breaking heat in terms of both high minimum and
maximum temperatures. Excessive Heat Warnings are in effect along
with a few Heat Advisories on the periphery as temperatures soar
into the 100s in the Pacific Northwest and the Northern Great
Basin. The heat is forecast to lessen somewhat at least in the
Seattle and Portland areas this weekend, but the interior will
remain hot, and above normal temperatures are expected to spread
toward the Northern Plains by Sunday. In addition to the heat, Air
Quality Alerts are in place for the Northwest and into parts of
the Rockies given smoke from fires and high ozone levels.
Unfortunately, isolated dry thunderstorms remain a threat as well,
which could spark additional fires. In the East, another day of
high humidity and hot temperatures creating high heat indices is
expected, and Heat Advisories are in effect from North Carolina to
Maine and also into portions of West Virginia, with Excessive Heat
Warnings embedded in the northern Mid-Atlantic. Heat Advisories
are also in place for portions of the Ark-La-Tex region into
southeastern Oklahoma.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1054 AM CST Fri Mar 12 2021

Valid 121700Z - 131200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF CENTRAL AND EASTERN
NEW MEXICO...

Some changes have been made to the ongoing critical/elevated areas
in NM. The cooler air and cloud cover is likely to remain entrenched
across northeast NM. Farther south into the Trans-Pecos, moisture
return continues to occur. Though strong westerly wind aloft will
mix the dryline east this afternoon, most location along and to the
east of the NM/TX border may only see briefly elevated conditions.

For southern New England, surface observations in parts of MA/CT
have RH values in the low 20s to upper teens. Though these
conditions may persist into the afternoon, fuels remain relatively
moist. Dry and windy conditions are also probable ahead of a
secondary cold front moving across PA/NJ by late afternoon. Winds
may reach 15 mph for a couple of hours in central/eastern PA. Fuels
are drier in these locations and will better support locally
elevated conditions as compared to New England.

..Wendt.. 03/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0200 AM CST Fri Mar 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level trough across the southern Great Basin
will deepen and become negatively tiled through the next 24 hours as
it moves east toward the Four Corners. At 500 mb a 70-80 kt
cyclonically curved jet will intensify to near 100 kts on the
southeastern flank of the trough. To the east, a low amplitude
trough will drive mid-level northwesterly flow across the
Mid-Atlantic. At the surface, broad lee cyclogenesis will gradually
take place across eastern New Mexico and southeastern Colorado with
a dryline trailing south across the southern High Plains. Critical
fire weather conditions are expected across portions of New Mexico
and west Texas.

...New Mexico...
The lee low across New Mexico and Colorado will deepen, slowly at
first, through the day in response to height falls ahead of the
approaching trough. Boundary-layer flow is forecast to increase to
20-30 mph through the day under the intensifying mid-level jet.
Widespread surface humidity of 5-15% will be supportive of critical
fire weather conditions across a broad swath of central and eastern
New Mexico. Humidity values will increase with eastward extent in
response to increasingly moist return flow across west Texas.
Despite the increase in moisture, gusty winds and plentiful fine
fuels will likely support elevated fire weather potential across
eastern New Mexico and far west Texas through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
Dry northwesterly surface flow around 15 mph and humidity values of
25-30% are forecast to develop behind a cold front across portions
of Virginia and the Mid-Atlantic through tomorrow afternoon. The dry
boundary-layer and gusty winds may support locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the day. Considerable uncertainty from
cloud/shower activity will limit confidence in deeper diurnal mixing
and more widespread elevated fire weather potential. However,
locally elevated conditions may develop regionally given marginally
supportive fuels and relatively dry and windy conditions.

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 15 2021 - 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021

...A couple of rounds of heavy rainfall are possible across the
southeastern quadrant of the CONUS next week...

...Overview...

As a surface and upper-level low initially over the south-central
U.S. track northeast and weaken, another upper trough is forecast
to move into the Northwest Monday and track east through the week,
likely spawning another low pressure/frontal system. As periods of
Gulf moisture flow in ahead of these systems, heavy rainfall is
possible Monday-Tuesday in the Tennessee Valley/Southeast and
again Wednesday-Thursday in the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The closed upper low over the central U.S. Monday appears
initially well-handled by model guidance, but some differences
remain with its track as it weakens and lifts out ahead of the
next trough serving as its kicker. 00Z/06Z guidance produced
generally quicker weakening of the related surface low over the
Ohio Valley by Tuesday compared to previous runs.

After a few model cycles with disagreements on the location and
potency of troughing/energy coming into the Northwest for the
early medium range period on Monday, the 00Z/06Z guidance tended
to have a better consensus with this feature, given better
alignment in the short range as that trough tracks over the
Pacific compared to yesterday's 12Z runs. Guidance indicates this
upper trough/low should drop southward into the Four Corners
region and then track eastward across the Plains midweek and
toward the Ohio Valley. This model cycle tended to show more
separation between this feature remaining the southern stream and
the northern stream, potentially through Thursday and beyond. The
strength of that upper low remains in question, with the 00Z
CMC/ECMWF stronger than GFS runs. However, its placement is not
terribly different among the deterministic guidance. The surface
low track associated with this feature aligns pretty well over the
south-central Plains Wednesday, but spread in its position
increases as it moves over the eastern U.S. and into the Atlantic
late in the workweek. The 00Z ECMWF seems to be a northern outlier
with its surface low position, though the 00Z CMC is north as
well, while the 06Z GFS clusters the best with the ensemble means,
so leaned toward the latter cluster. This surface low spread also
affects the axis and precipitation type of the associated QPF from
the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Northeast.

All considered, model agreement for this cycle appeared generally
okay, but run-to-run inconsistencies show that confidence is still
not high. The WPC forecast transitioned from a mainly
deterministic blend early in the period and trended toward the
ensemble means later given the uncertainties arising.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The initial low system will still support wrap-around snow on its
northwest/north side in the cold sector, with best chances across
the Corn Belt/Upper Midwest Monday. Additionally, overrunning atop
a cold surface high could lead to some light snow in higher
elevations of the Central Appalachians and into the Northeast
Monday-Tuesday. Farther south, modest to potentially heavy rain,
perhaps driven by convection, is likely across the Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys and Southeast. Confidence then continues to increase
regarding another round of rain near and ahead of the next low
pressure system, with modest to possibly heavy amounts from the
Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys toward the Southern
Appalachians and Southeast Wednesday-Thursday and perhaps the East
Coast by next Friday. Precipitation is possible farther north as
well, but as mentioned, details are uncertain at this point and
vary depending on the low track.

Underneath the West trough, some precipitation is possible over
the Intermountain West toward the Rockies early in the workweek.
Snow is once again likely for the Central Rockies and some could
spread into the Central Plains Tuesday-Wednesday, but should not
be as intense as the system this weekend. Renewed precipitation is
expected for the Pacific Northwest and northern California for the
latter part of the week as another upper low spins over the
northeastern Pacific.

Temperatures will be mild ahead of the Plains system through the
Southeast, but colder than normal in the Northeast until the high
moves offshore. Somewhat cooler than average temperatures will
follow behind the lead and subsequent Plains and Northwest
systems, respectively. Temperatures may be variable across the
High Plains but within about 5-15 degrees of normal for the middle
of March.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
122 PM EST Fri Mar 12 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 15 2021 - 12Z Fri Mar 19 2021

...A couple of rounds of heavy rainfall are possible across the
southeastern quadrant of the CONUS next week...

...Overview...

As a surface and upper-level low initially over the south-central
U.S. track northeast and weaken, another upper trough is forecast
to move into the Northwest Monday and track east through the week,
likely spawning another low pressure/frontal system. As periods of
Gulf moisture flow in ahead of these systems, heavy rainfall is
possible Monday-Tuesday in the Tennessee Valley/Southeast and
again Wednesday-Thursday in the Lower Mississippi/Tennessee
Valleys, Southern Appalachians, and Southeast.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The closed upper low over the central U.S. Monday appears
initially well-handled by model guidance, but some differences
remain with its track as it weakens and lifts out ahead of the
next trough serving as its kicker. 00Z/06Z guidance produced
generally quicker weakening of the related surface low over the
Ohio Valley by Tuesday compared to previous runs.

After a few model cycles with disagreements on the location and
potency of troughing/energy coming into the Northwest for the
early medium range period on Monday, the 00Z/06Z guidance tended
to have a better consensus with this feature, given better
alignment in the short range as that trough tracks over the
Pacific compared to yesterday's 12Z runs. Guidance indicates this
upper trough/low should drop southward into the Four Corners
region and then track eastward across the Plains midweek and
toward the Ohio Valley. This model cycle tended to show more
separation between this feature remaining the southern stream and
the northern stream, potentially through Thursday and beyond. The
strength of that upper low remains in question, with the 00Z
CMC/ECMWF stronger than GFS runs. However, its placement is not
terribly different among the deterministic guidance. The surface
low track associated with this feature aligns pretty well over the
south-central Plains Wednesday, but spread in its position
increases as it moves over the eastern U.S. and into the Atlantic
late in the workweek. The 00Z ECMWF seems to be a northern outlier
with its surface low position, though the 00Z CMC is north as
well, while the 06Z GFS clusters the best with the ensemble means,
so leaned toward the latter cluster. This surface low spread also
affects the axis and precipitation type of the associated QPF from
the Middle Mississippi Valley to the Northeast.

All considered, model agreement for this cycle appeared generally
okay, but run-to-run inconsistencies show that confidence is still
not high. The WPC forecast transitioned from a mainly
deterministic blend early in the period and trended toward the
ensemble means later given the uncertainties arising.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

The initial low system will still support wrap-around snow on its
northwest/north side in the cold sector, with best chances across
the Corn Belt/Upper Midwest Monday. Additionally, overrunning atop
a cold surface high could lead to some light snow in higher
elevations of the Central Appalachians and into the Northeast
Monday-Tuesday. Farther south, modest to potentially heavy rain,
perhaps driven by convection, is likely across the Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys and Southeast. Confidence then continues to increase
regarding another round of rain near and ahead of the next low
pressure system, with modest to possibly heavy amounts from the
Lower Mississippi/Tennessee Valleys toward the Southern
Appalachians and Southeast Wednesday-Thursday and perhaps the East
Coast by next Friday. Precipitation is possible farther north as
well, but as mentioned, details are uncertain at this point and
vary depending on the low track.

Underneath the West trough, some precipitation is possible over
the Intermountain West toward the Rockies early in the workweek.
Snow is once again likely for the Central Rockies and some could
spread into the Central Plains Tuesday-Wednesday, but should not
be as intense as the system this weekend. Renewed precipitation is
expected for the Pacific Northwest and northern California for the
latter part of the week as another upper low spins over the
northeastern Pacific.

Temperatures will be mild ahead of the Plains system through the
Southeast, but colder than normal in the Northeast until the high
moves offshore. Somewhat cooler than average temperatures will
follow behind the lead and subsequent Plains and Northwest
systems, respectively. Temperatures may be variable across the
High Plains but within about 5-15 degrees of normal for the middle
of March.

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO INTO
ADJACENT TEXAS SOUTH PLAINS...

Changes have been made to the ongoing critical and elevated areas.
Surface low pressure will continue to deepen in the southern High
Plains through today and into Saturday as the upper-level
intensifies. This will lead to prolonged period of low-level
moisture advection into the Texas Panhandle and northeastern New
Mexico. With warm advection precipitation/thunderstorms probable
into mid-morning Saturday, the elevated and critical areas have been
trimmed southward. Areas that do see precipitation could still see
briefly dry and very windy conditions as the dryline passes east by
mid to late afternoon.

..Wendt.. 03/12/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0201 AM CST Fri Mar 12 2021/

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted mid-level trough across the Four Corners will
continue to deepen/mature through the day as a 90-100 kt mid-level
jet streak wraps around the eastern side of the trough. A surface
low will rapidly develop across eastern Colorado as northwesterly
flow aloft will dominate the eastern US. Critical fire weather
conditions are expected across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions are likely
behind a well developed dryline/lee trough across eastern New Mexico
and west Texas through tomorrow evening. Surface pressure gradients
and the strong mid-level jet will bolster southwesterly
boundary-layer flow to 25-40 mph through the afternoon hours. The
dry nature of the downslope airmass and deep diurnal mixing will
contribute to surface RH as low as 10% through peak heating. Given
receptive fine fuels across much of the region, critical fire
weather conditions are likely. However, the eastward extent of
elevated/critical conditions remains somewhat uncertain due to model
differences in dryline mixing/placement through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post frontal airmass is likely to develop across portions of
the Mid-Atlantic tomorrow afternoon as high pressure is forecast to
intensify across the central Great Lakes.  Westerly winds of 10 to
15 mph and surface humidity of 25-30% will be possible. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may develop through the afternoon
hours, but high-cloud cover and marginal fuels may keep potential
limited to locally elevated.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri March 12 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 18 - 22 2021

Model guidance continues to feature a progressive longwave pattern over the
central and eastern CONUS during the 6-10 day period with a 500-hPa trough
shifting from the Mississippi Valley to the East Coast on days 6 and 7 (Mar
18-19). As this longwave trough progresses eastward later next week, a low
pressure system and trailing front support either near normal or elevated
probabilities of above normal precipitation across the eastern third of the
CONUS. A 500-hPa trough offshore of the West Coast and enhanced onshore flow
leads to increased probabilities of above normal precipitation for the Pacific
Northwest and northern California. For the remainder of the CONUS, forecast
confidence is lower in the precipitation outlook as ensemble means diverge on
when a shortwave trough over the North Pacific tracks eastward into the West.
Due to support from the 0Z Canadian ensemble mean and a trend towards the
development of a Rex block over the North Pacific and Alaska, the slower
progression of this shortwave trough, as depicted by the 0Z ECMWF ensemble
mean, is preferred today. Therefore, surface high pressure is more likely to
prevail over the Rockies and Great Plains during most if not all of the 6-10
day period, favoring below normal precipitation for these areas along with the
Southwest.

Forecast confidence in the 6-10 day temperature outlook Is limited due to a
variable pattern during this 5-day period and continued poor agreement between
the GEFS (colder) and ECMWF (warmer) reforecast tools. Cold air advection
early
in the period increases probabilities of below normal temperatures across the
Lower Mississippi Valley and western Gulf Coast. The favored area of below
normal temperatures for the central Rockies and adjacent High Plains is
related
to any lingering effects on surface temperatures due to the likelihood of
widespread, heavy snowfall this weekend. Elsewhere, throughout the CONUS, near
to above normal temperatures are favored based in part on positive 500-hPa
height anomalies. The largest probabilities (more than 50 percent) of above
normal temperature are forecast across Arizona and North Dakota where positive
temperature anomalies are forecast to be the largest on days 6 and 7.

The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z Canadian ensemble mean solutions are most bullish in the
development of a Rex block over Alaska and the North Pacific during the day
6-10 period. This evolving longwave pattern favors near to above normal
temperatures throughout Alaska. Below normal precipitation is also more likely
except for the Panhandle, due to the close proximity of the closed 500-hPa low
which may promote onshore flow.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 45% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day
8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due to
a predicted variable temperature pattern during this 5-day period, especially
the central and eastern CONUS, and poor agreement among many temperature and
precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 20 - 26 2021

The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean remains consistent with a blocking pattern becoming
established over Alaska and the North Pacific by week-2, with a ridge building
to the north of a closed 500-hPa low over the Gulf of Alaska. A majority of
the
ensemble members depict a low amplitude ridge (trough) over the western
(eastern) CONUS during week-2. The ensemble means feature positive 500-hPa
height anomalies throughout nearly all of the CONUS, implying a trend towards
either near or above normal temperatures. Since the start of week-2 may begin
relatively cold and then followed by a warming trend, near normal temperatures
are favored for the south-central CONUS extending northwest to the central
Rockies.

A low pressure system and its trailing front are forecast to exit the East
Coast by day 8. As surface high pressure prevails during most of week-2,
increased probabilities of below normal precipitation are forecast for the
East
Coast and much of the Southeast. A transient shortwave trough is expected to
eventually emerge from the North Pacific and track eastward across the
northern
tier of the CONUS later in week-2. Dynamical model guidance has trended wetter
today and above normal precipitation is slightly favored across parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes. Ridging aloft increases
probabilities
of below normal precipitation for much of California and the Southwest, except
for areas that are climatologically dry during late March. Above normal
precipitation remains favored for the Pacific Northwest due to the presence of
a 500-hPa trough upstream over the North Pacific.

Ensemble means depict a closed 500-hPa low over the North Pacific with
positive
500-hPa height anomalies to the north over Alaska. The longwave pattern favors
near or above normal temperatures throughout Alaska. Increased probabilities
of
below normal precipitation are forecast for Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians,
but near normal precipitation is favored for the Panhandle with the persistent
500-hPa trough over the North Pacific.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 25% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 45% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to
improving agreement among temperature tools offset by forecast uncertainty
associated with the blocking pattern expected to develop over Alaska and the
North Pacific.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST March 12 2021

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level flow is anticipated to be predominantly weak during the
beginning to middle of week-2, resulting in low potential for meteorological
hazards across the lower 48 and Alaska. Towards the end of the period,
multiple
models (ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian) indicate possible mid-level low pressure
forming across the central lower 48, supporting formation of a cold front
moving across the eastern half of the Contiguous U.S. This front may increase
chances for heavy precipitation across parts of the Midwest during the middle
of week-2. There is good agreement amongst these models indicating the
possibility of a storm forming over the Gulf of Alaska, although no related
hazards are posted for Alaska at this time.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy precipitation across parts of the Mississippi Valley,
eastern Great Plains, Great Lakes, and Ohio Valley, Mon-Wed, Mar 22-24.

Flooding possible for portions of the Central Plains, Middle Mississippi
Valley, and Ohio Valley.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY MARCH 15 - FRIDAY MARCH 19:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!oT3KxUNr_73sY1T4Bbh-cdfmkZW_KbwwgHUA4-7EjTn7R7jXhEz21du_rLwFQTFEovoOq3KD$

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 20 - FRIDAY MARCH 26: Zonal mid-level flow is forecast to
dominate the beginning to middle of week-2, albeit with the possibility of
weak
embedded short-wave troughs, thus decreasing the potential for widespread
hazards. However, there is insufficient model agreement indicating the
increased risk for much below normal temperatures lasting beyond a day,
precluding a much below normal temperature risk from being highlighted in
today's outlook. By the middle of the period, however, multiple model (ECMWF,
GEFS, and Canadian) ensemble means predict the formation and amplification of
a
mid-level trough somewhere near the Great Plains or Four Corners region
(around
March 23). This pattern could support surface low formation over the central
CONUS and an associated cold front moving across the eastern half of the
CONUS,
which could bring heavy precipitation to parts of the region. A slight risk
for
heavy precipitation is highlighted on today's outlook for parts of the
Midwest,
Mar 22 to 24. Even though both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate
3-day totals being below the predetermined hazards criteria (>85th percentile
and one inch), there has been good run to run model consistency regarding the
potential for a cold front. A broad area of risk is posted where the greatest
likelihood for heavy precipitation would be based on the anticipated cold
front
including where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance
of exceeding 0.75 inches in a 3-day period. The 6Z deterministic GFS indicates
some of these areas possibly receiving 24-hour accumulations exceeding 4
inches.



The greatest related concern associated with possible heavy rainfall during
week-2 is flood potential over the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valleys and
Central Plains, as precipitation is forecast to be well above-normal over the
lower Midwest and Middle and Lower Mississippi Valley during week-1. The 8-14
day extended range outlook has now shifted from below-normal rainfall to
near-normal across this region. Any increase in precipitation may exacerbate
river levels. Therefore, the possible flooding area is maintained for the
region.



Similar to yesterday, the ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means continue to favor
anomalous troughing centered over the Northeast Pacific. There is more
agreement today between the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means depicting the week-2
mid-level negative height departures remaining off the West Coast. Similar to
the last few days, GEFS reforecast tool shows at least a 20% chance of 3-day
accumulated precipitation amounts exceeding the 85th percentile and 1 inch
(1.5
inches across coastal Pacific Northwest), whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool
does not. Given these continued model differences and increased uncertainty in
regards to the risk of heavy precipitation over the West Coast, a related
hazard is not designated at this time.



Over Alaska there is good agreement amongst model ensemble means (ECMWF, GEFS,
and Canadian) indicating above normal 500hPa heights across the state and
above
normal temperatures during the period. Surface low pressure is anticipated to
form over the Gulf of Alaska throughout week-2. Model guidance including the
reforecast tools, however, do not support increased chances for precipitation
or wind hazards at this time.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible over portions
of the Central/Southern Plains and the Mississippi Valley through
Sunday...

...Major winter storm to impact the Central Rockies and central
High Plains Friday evening and throughout the weekend...

...Critical risk of fire weather possible for much of New Mexico
and parts of western Texas...

A stationary front draped across Central/Southern Plains and
Middle Mississippi Valley is expected to be the focal point for
heavy rain and potentially severe thunderstorms throughout the
weekend. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for
severe thunderstorms for northwest Texas and western Oklahoma into
tomorrow morning. Damaging wind gusts, large hail, and isolated
tornadoes are expected to be the main threats with these storms.
The potential for severe weather will continue throughout the
period, with the primary region of concern tomorrow being a
Enhanced Risk area extending from the eastern Texas Panhandle to
western Oklahoma, southeastern Arkansas and northwestern
Mississippi will be at greatest risk on Sunday. Moisture pulled
northward from the Gulf of Mexico and an active, very slow moving
frontal boundary will serve as the ingredients in the recipe for
high rain rates over middle America. This evening into tomorrow
rainfall totals of one to two inches will be possible over the
eastern Central Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley. Having
already been subject to two to three inches of rain in the past 24
hours thereby saturating the soils, the Weather Prediction Center
has issued a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall for portions of
these regions and Flood Warnings and Watches are currently in
effect. As the frontal boundary lifts into the Central Plains on
Saturday the heavy rain, thunderstorms, and threat for flash
flooding will shift as well. With rainfall totals in excess of two
to three inches in 24 hours possible over the Central Plains
Saturday into Sunday, a Slight Risk of Excessive Rainfall will
remain in effect for the region through Sunday.

Out West, a deep cut-off upper-level low over the Southwest will
be the driving force behind a significant winter storm set to
impact the Central Rockies and the central High Plains throughout
the weekend. Prior to the main event, heavy snow could fall across
portions of the Central Great Basin and Southwest, with high
elevation regions of Utah and Arizona likely to see six inches of
snow by tomorrow morning. Showers and thunderstorms will also be
possible over southern California and southwestern Arizona into
the early morning hours. A low pressure system forming over the
Central Great Basin Friday night will produce the first round of
snow Friday into Saturday. As the weekend progresses, this low is
forecast to join with the system in the Central Plains to produce
a mature occluded cyclone, which will continue the heavy snowfall
Central Rockies and the central High Plains through Sunday. By the
end of the weekend, it is highly likely that one to two feet of
snow will fall across the Front Range of northern Colorado, the
Laramie Range in Wyoming, and the I-25 urban corridor, while more
than a foot is possible over the central High Plains.
Additionally, strong winds gusting from 30 to 40 mph will likely
accompany the heavy snow fall rates of one to two inches per hour.
This will create near blizzard conditions, making road and air
travel difficult if not impossible. Winter Storm Watches and
Warnings have been issued for much of Wyoming and Colorado as well
as northeastern Utah and the western portions of Nebraska and
South Dakota.

Some light wintry precipitation ahead of a cold front is possible
over interior New England early on Sunday. In the Upper Midwest,
high temperatures 20 to 30 degrees above normal will be possible
on Saturday. A cold front moving through the Pacific Northwest on
Sunday will bring precipitation of all kinds to the region as well
as northern California. Over the southern High Plains, dry
conditions and gusty downslope winds south of the developing
winter storm will promote elevated to critical fire danger across
these areas into the weekend.

...Bouts of heavy rainfall possible across the southeastern
quadrant of the CONUS next week...

...Overview...

An upper low over the Four Corners region Tuesday will track
eastward through the week, promoting a chance of locally heavy
rainfall over parts of the South/Tennessee Valley later in the
week. In the Pacific, a reloading upper low will send weakening
systems into the West with the brunt of the precipitation into
British Columbia. Temperatures will be near normal for much of the
lower 48 with any warm-up ahead of a cold front replaced be cooler
air in its wake.

...Model Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 12Z/18Z guidance suite was overall clustered well enough such
that a consensus blend approach served well to start the forecast
period. The recent GFS runs differed from the ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET
(and parallel GFS) over the Pac NW early in the period with how
lingering upper troughing exits the region, but otherwise was
acceptable. By later in the week, the GFS became quicker to take
the trough and surface front eastward but the Canadian was much
slower. The 12Z ECMWF was a middle ground solution near the
ensemble mean consensus (ECMWF ensemble mean even slower than the
ECMWF HRES) and was a reasonable solution. Increased ensemble
weighting by the start of next weekend in favor of the ECMWF
ensemble mean which was a bit more defined and consistent than the
GEFS mean as teleconnections support at least modest ridging along
and east of the Rockies with Pacific troughing largely offshore.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Lead system will bring light to modest rain/snow to the central
Rockies and into the Plains Tuesday, with rainfall expanding over
the Southeast along a warm front. To the north, some light snow is
possible through the Corn Belt and into higher elevations of the
central Appalachians and into the Northeast later in the week as
the area of low pressure heads toward the East Coast. Rainfall
could be heavy in some locations in the warm air mass near and
inland from the Gulf Coast Tue-Thu. Farther west, approaching
Pacific system will spread low elevation rain and higher elevation
snow to the West Coast (NorCal and northern Sierra into coastal
OR/WA) especially Wednesday onward.

Temperatures will be mild over the Southeast Tue-Wed with
widespread 70s just south of the warm front. Colder than normal
temperatures will follow the cold front out of the Rockies
Tuesday, where highs will be 5-15 degrees below normal. A gradual
warm-up is forecast for the interior West into the High Plains
later in the period as upper ridging crests over the Rockies.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A deep upper low over the Four Corners will translate eastward today
supporting lee cyclogensis across the central High Plains.
Northwesterly flow aloft and surface high pressure will support cool
and dry conditions across much of the Northeast. Critical fire
weather conditions are expected across portions of the southern High
Plains, with locally elevated fire weather potential possible across
New England.

...Southern High Plains...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected to the west of a well
developed dryline forecast to stall across the central Texas
Panhandle. Surface flow will increase to 25-40 mph with higher gusts
owing to deep vertical mixing and a strong mid-level jet streak over
the Four Corners. The deep mixing and warm temperatures will support
RH in the single digits to low teens across much of eastern New
Mexico. Dry fuels in the presence of the well mixed/windy boundary
layer in regional model soundings suggests critical fire weather
conditions are very likely through the afternoon and evening hours.


Across northeastern New Mexico, wrap-around moisture behind the
departing lee low will support the development of
showers/thunderstorms this morning through the early afternoon.
Precipitation that develops will limit the potential for fire
weather conditions this afternoon. However, rapid drying of the
boundary-layer and very strong surface winds behind the low may
support locally elevated fire weather conditions late this afternoon
and evening.

...Northeast...
Behind a cold front, dry surface conditions are expected across New
England and portions of the Mid-Atlantic with surface RH of 20-30%.
Surface winds will likely remain below critical thresholds given
increasing high pressure across the Ohio valley. However, the
presence of dry fuels and very dry surface condition suggests
locally elevated/critical fire weather conditions may develop
despite weaker winds and cool temperatures.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND SOUTHEAST NEW
MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
The upper low ejecting eastward across the southern Plains will
stall and become vertically stacked as it slowly begins to fill
through tomorrow evening. Strong mid-level flow along the southern
half of the low will linger above the Southwest and southern High
Plains supporting dry and windy conditions. A shortwave trough
embedded within very strong northwesterly flow over the Northeast
will bringing cool, dry, and windy conditions to the Mid Atlantic.

...Southwest Texas southeast New Mexico...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected through day as strong
westerly flow and dry surface conditions overlap with critically dry
fuels. Model soundings show a deep well-mixed boundary layer with
surface RH of 10-15% in the wake of a deep lee cyclone. A 60-80 kt
mid-level jet streak above the region will bolster surface winds to
25-40 mph with higher gusts through the afternoon and evening.
Despite some light precipitation over the past few days, critical
fire weather conditions will likely develop, given plentiful dry
fuels and the magnitude of dry/windy conditions.

...Northeast...
A post frontal airmass across the Mid-Atlantic may support elevated
to near critical fire weather conditions through the afternoon and
evening. A northwesterly mid-level jet will enhance boundary-layer
mixing in a cold advection regime. Surface winds of 15-25 mph are
likely through the afternoon. With dry northwesterly flow, surface
RH of 30-35% is forecast to develop. While fuels are not overly
supportive and cooling temperatures may hamper the overall threat
somewhat, the degree of dry and windy conditions will support
elevated fire weather potential.

...A major winter storm is expected to impact the central Rockies
and central High Plains throughout the weekend...

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding over portions of the
central to southern Plains this weekend will move into the
mid-Mississippi Valley on Monday...

...Critical fire danger for much of New Mexico and parts of
western Texas...

The stage is set for a rather energetic low pressure system to
bring multiple forms of hazardous weather across the central
portion of the country through the weekend, as a cold upper-level
low exiting the Southwest interacts with a stationary front across
the central Plains.  The stationary front has continued to be the
focus for bouts of severe thunderstorms together with locally
heavy rain across the central Plains to the mid-Mississippi
Valley.  The cold upper low is currently spreading higher
elevation snows into the Four-Corners region of the southwestern
U.S.  As the upper low edges closer toward the central Plains
today, snow will become heavier and will continue to expand into
the central Rockies later today.  Meanwhile, the intensifying
storm will also ingest additional Gulf moisture and dump more
heavy rain across the central Plains today.  The heavy rain will
then lift north and northwestward toward the central High Plains
later today as the low pressure system intensifies further, as
heavy snow with possibly blizzard conditions expected to envelop
the Front Range of Colorado and Wyoming.  The storm should reach
peak intensity on Sunday, bringing snowfall amounts of possibly 4
feet for the highest elevations while one to two feet would be
quite common across the nearby central High Plains along the Front
Range of Colorado and Wyoming.  Widespread travel impacts are
likely as strong winds combining with snowfall rates of one to two
inches per hour to produce blizzard conditions for some areas.
Blizzard Warnings, Winter Storm Watches and Warnings have been
issued for much the central Rockies to the central High Plains.
Meanwhile, strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast to move
across the southern Plains through the weekend ahead of a strong
cold front associated with the intensifying low pressure system,
reaching into the mid-Mississippi Valley by Monday.

Out West, a deep cut-off upper-level low over the Southwest will
be the driving force behind a significant winter storm set to
impact the Central Rockies and the central High Plains throughout
the weekend. Prior to the main event, heavy snow could fall across
portions of the Central Great Basin and Southwest, with high
elevation regions of Utah and Arizona likely to see six inches of
snow by tomorrow morning. Showers and thunderstorms will also be
possible over southern California and southwestern Arizona into
the early morning hours. A low pressure system forming over the
Central Great Basin Friday night will produce the first round of
snow Friday into Saturday. As the weekend progresses, this low is
forecast to join with the system in the Central Plains to produce
a mature occluded cyclone, which will continue the heavy snowfall
over the Central Rockies and the central High Plains through
Sunday. By the end of the weekend, it is highly likely that one to
two feet of snow will have fallen across the Front Range of
northern Colorado, the Laramie Range in Wyoming, and the I-25
urban corridor, while accumulations of over a foot are possible
over the central High Plains. Strong winds gusting from 30 to 40
mph are also expected to accompany the heavy snow fall rates of
one to two inches per hour. This will create near blizzard
conditions, making road and air travel difficult if not
impossible. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings have been issued for
much of Wyoming and Colorado as well as northeastern Utah and the
western portions of Nebraska and South Dakota.

Some light wintry precipitation ahead of a cold front is possible
over interior New England early on Sunday. In the Upper Midwest,
high temperatures 20 to 30 degrees above normal have been
forecasted for Saturday. A cold front moving through the Pacific
Northwest on Sunday will bring precipitation of all kinds to the
region and northern California. Over the southern High Plains, dry
conditions and gusty downslope winds south of the developing
winter storm will promote elevated to critical fire danger across
these areas into the weekend.

with the intensifying low pressure system, reaching into the
mid-Mississippi Valley by Monday.  In addition, dry and strong
downslope winds to the south of the storm are expected to promote
elevated to critical fire danger across the southern High Plains.

Outside of the major storm system, some light wintry precipitation
is expected over interior New England on Sunday as reinforcing
shots of colder air move in from Canada.  In contrast, much above
normal temperatures are forecast to return for the northern Plains
to the Upper Midwest.  Out West, an active cold front from the
eastern Pacific is expected to bring the next round of unsettled
weather into much of the West Coast beginning on Sunday.  The
Sierra Nevada could see heavy snow impacting the region Sunday
night into Monday, as rain spreads into the lower elevations of
northern and central California.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1102 AM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021

Valid 181700Z - 191200Z

Windy, relatively dry conditions are expected across the central
High Plains into the northern Plains this afternoon ahead of a cold
front given the presence of surface lee troughing. However, surface
RH appears too high in guidance (i.e. 25-30%) to substantiate
Elevated highlights across the northern Plains for this afternoon,
though locally Elevated conditions may still develop.

Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 08/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper low across the Great Basin and western US will move slowly
to the east as strong northerly flow advanced into northern
California. A cold front at the surface will move east generating
showers and thunderstorms over the Rockies, while keeping dry and
windy conditions likely in northern California.

...Northern California...
Behind the upper low, 40 to 50 kt northerly mid-level flow will
linger across northern portions of the Sacramento Valley before
weakening as the low shifts east tonight. At the surface, a cold
front associated with the trough should advance slowly southward
through the day. A combination of momentum transfer from the
stronger mid-level flow, and a thermally induced surface pressure
trough will likely support sustained surface winds of 15-20 mph
through the afternoon. Warm diurnal temperatures will also support
minimum surface RH around 15-20%. With dry and windy conditions
expected within an area of active fires and very dry fuels elevated
to locally critical conditions appear probable.

...Eastern Nevada...
Along the sagging cold front across eastern Nevada and western Utah,
showers and thunderstorms are forecast to develop by mid morning. A
few lightning strikes may occur within dry fuels over the area.
However, relatively high low-level moisture content will limit the
potential for dry strikes. Strong wind gusts along the front may
also support a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions
where fuels remain dry.

FOR THURSDAY AUGUST 26 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 01: The 0Z ECMWF ensemble mean
favors a more amplified mid-level pattern compared to the 0Z GEFS and 0Z
Canadian, with mid-level ridging across the western half of the CONUS and
troughing across the eastern half. The 0Z GEFS and Canadian favor a broader=
,
weaker mid-level ridge stretching across the western two-thirds of the CONU=
S
on
day 8 (Aug 26), but develop a  trough across the northwestern CONUS by day =
9.
Despite these model differences, the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools both
indicate elevated potential for excessive heat across lower elevation areas
across parts of the West. A slight risk of excessive heat is maintained for
parts of the Central Valley of California and Desert Southwest, Aug 26 to 2=
8,
where reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatur=
es
exceeding the 85th percentile and 100 Deg F. An area of slight risk of
excessive heat is highlighted across the lower elevation areas of the North=
ern
Great Basin for Aug 26 to 27, given good model persistence with yesterday's
guidance. Both reforecast tools show at least a 20% chance of maximum
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F in this highlighted
region. The slight risk of excessive heat across the southeastern CONUS in
yesterday's outlook is not included in today's forecast since a mid-level
trough is expected to form across the eastern CONUS at the start of week-2,
leading to the elevated heat potential diminishing by day 8.



Both the reforecast tools indicate increased potential for heavy precipitat=
ion
across parts of the Gulf Coast, although the mechanisms are slightly
different.
The 6Z deterministic GFS/GEFS shows more tropical waves emerging from the G=
ulf
of Mexico and approaching the Gulf Coast, whereas the 0Z ECMWF ensemble mea=
n
and its deterministic solution favors weaker surface lows forming in the Gu=
lf
of Mexico compared to the GFS/GEFS, with the heavy precipitation primarily
resulting from a cold front forming close to the coast. Despite these varyi=
ng
mechanisms, a broad area is highlighted for a slight risk of heavy
precipitation across the western and central Gulf Coast for Aug 28 to 30 ba=
sed
on where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools generally show at least a 20%
chance of 3-day rainfall totals exceeding the 85th percentile and one inch,=
 as
well as where recent deterministic GFS solutions indicate the possibility f=
or
heavy rainfall.



Multiple model ensemble means favor the mid-level ridge centered further so=
uth
across the Four Corners region during week-2, which would limit the amount =
of
moisture into the region. Recent runs of the deterministic GFS show potenti=
al
for a tropical cyclone forming in the East Pacific tracking closer to the
mouth
of the Gulf of California which could enhance moisture flow into the Four
Corners region. The deterministic 0Z ECMWF, however, continues to favor a
weaker tropical disturbance tracking further south, which would be less
favorable for enhancing moisture into the southwestern CONUS. Both of the
reforecast tools do not show a favorable wet signal for the Four Corners, t=
hus
no related precipitation or flooding hazards are highlighted over the
Southwest. However, any thunderstorms that do develop may lead to localized
flash flooding.



Weak mid-level troughing is predicted for week-2 across Alaska. The predict=
ed
pattern is not anticipated to support widespread enhanced risk of hazards.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 PM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021

Valid 191200Z - 201200Z

An Elevated area was added to portions of the Sacramento Valley and
lee-side slopes of the northern Coast Ranges in northern California
for tomorrow/Thursday, where fuels remain critically receptive to
fire spread. Though modest, northerly flow aloft from the
westernmost periphery of a departing upper trough should support 15
mph sustained northerly surface winds for at least a few hours
during the mid to late afternoon, when 15-20% minimum RH
materializes. Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track,
with locally dry and windy conditions still possible across portions
of the Plains states and southern Great Basin ahead of a surface
cold front.

..Squitieri.. 08/18/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0151 AM CDT Wed Aug 18 2021/

...Synopsis...
In the mid-levels, the upper low over the Great Basin will advance
eastward and become negatively tilted as stronger westerly flow
overspread the Rockies. Increasing height falls ahead of the trough
and stronger flow aloft will support lee cyclogenesis through the
forecast period. In response, low-level southerly flow is forecast
to increase, bringing deep moisture northward across the High
Plains. With abundant lift and deep moisture in place, widespread
showers and thunderstorms are expected across the eastern Rockies
and High Plains. Locally elevated fire weather conditions may occur
along the western edge of the deeper moisture where gusty surface
winds off the higher terrain overlap with dry fuels. However, the
expected coverage of precipitation suggests organized fire weather
concerns will be negligible.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed August 18 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 24 - 28 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa
circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the
6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast a trough over
Mainland
Alaska associated with below-normal 500-hPa heights. A ridge is predicted o=
ver
the western Canada, with above-normal heights favored over parts of the Ala=
ska
Panhandle and northwestern CONUS. A weak trough is predicted over the Upper
Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes, associated with near to slightly below
normal heights. A subtropical ridge is predicted over the southern tier of =
the
CONUS with near-normal 500-hPa heights favored over much of the South and
East.

Below normal temperature probabilities are elevated across most of Mainland
Alaska, influenced by nearby forecast troughing. Above normal temperatures =
are
favored across much of the western CONUS, Central and Southern Rockies,
Central
and Southern Plains, and eastward to the Atlantic coast due to predicted
500-hPa ridging and near to above normal heights forecast over most areas. =
A
predicted trough over the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest favors enhanced
probabilities of near to below normal temperatures there.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over central and
northern
Mainland Alaska due to increased potential for storm system development. Be=
low
normal precipitation chances are increased over southwestern Mainland Alask=
a
and the Aleutians, ahead of a forecast ridge. Below normal precipitation
probabilities are enhanced over most of the western CONUS, due to forecast
above normal 500-hPa heights, and consistent with the ERF consolidation
forecast tool. The positively tilted trough forecast in the Northern Plains
and
Midwest supports an increasing likelihood of above normal precipitation for
most of the Eastern Seaboard and parts of the Central and Southern Plains w=
ith
an active storm track favored.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today=

0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean cente=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by some differences among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 26 - SEP 01, 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is similar to the
6-10 day period, but generally forecast to shift eastward and deamplify. Th=
e
troughing shifts eastward over the Gulf of Alaska and a ridge is forecast o=
ver
the Northern Rockies and Plains with a trough moving into the eastern CONUS=
.
Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are forecast over most of the CONUS an=
d
Alaska.

500-hPa troughing forecast over Alaska favors below normal temperatures for
central and northern Mainland Alaska. Forecast above normal 500-hPa heights
increase chances for above normal temperatures over western Mainland Alaska
and
the Aleutians. Near to above normal temperatures are favored across the
western
CONUS, most of the Southern Plains and Southeast, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. Enhanced probabilities of below-normal
temperatures are favored over parts of the Northern and Central Plains, muc=
h
of
the Great Lakes and Northeast, associated with the eastward progression of =
the
troughs and potential increased cloudiness.

Troughing over Mainland Alaska increases the chances of above-normal
precipitation over central and northern Mainland Alaska. Below-normal
precipitation is predicted for southern Alaska underneath the above normal
500-hPa heights. Below normal precipitation is likely for much of the
northwestern CONUS, extending to the Great Basin, Rockies, Northern Plains,
Great Lakes and parts of the Southern High Plains, consistent with the
consolidation forecast tool. A mean frontal boundary and potential tropical
moisture lead to enhanced probabilities of above-normal precipitation acros=
s
parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast to much of the Eastern Seaboard.
Below-normal precipitation is likely over southern parts of the Florida
Peninsula, consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=
0%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's=
 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models on the large-scale circulation pattern, off=
set
by increasing uncertainty and differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

...Henri to strengthen to a Hurricane and threaten New England
this weekend...

...Model Analysis and preferences...

There is quite a bit of guidance variance with the ultimate track
of strengthening Henri over the western Atlantic, but overall
there has been a westward more progressive guidance trend over the
past few runs that offers an increasing threat for maritime
interests and New England this weekend. Please refer to the latest
NHC advisories for updated forecasts on Henri.
Elsewhere, models and ensembles are in much better general
agreement with the 12 UTC GFS now in even better in line with
other models, ensembles and the National Blend of Models over much
of the nation days 3-7, bolstering forecast confidence. A
composite blend is preferred to smooth out the less predictable
smaller scale differences consistent with uncertainties.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Strengthening Henri looms over a highly settled Western Atlantic
and the latest NHC track increasingly threatens New England this
weekend with potential for enhanced winds/waves and rainfall.
Again, please refer to the latest NHC advisories for updated
forecasts.

Upstream, amplified upper trough energies will steadily progress
from the Northwest to the north-central U.S. then Great
Lakes/Midwest this weekend into next week and spread potential for
moderate amounts of lead convection/rainfall that may produce more
local heavier amounts. Some high elevation snows are possible in
this pattern for a cooled Northern Rockies with the approach and
passage of the aforementioned upper troughs and associated frontal
system and low developments and progression across this broad
region. Meanwhile underneath, an upper ridge/high that is forecast
to extend across the south-central U.S/South will support a
protracted period of hot and humid temperatures over this broad
region.

...Henri to strengthen to a Hurricane and threaten New England
this weekend...

...Model Analysis and preferences...

There is quite a bit of guidance variance with the ultimate track
of strengthening Henri over the western Atlantic, but overall
there has been a westward more progressive guidance trend over the
past few runs that offers an increasing threat for maritime
interests and New England this weekend. Please refer to the latest
NHC advisories for updated forecasts on Henri.
Elsewhere, models and ensembles are in much better general
agreement with the 12 UTC GFS now in even better in line with
other models, ensembles and the National Blend of Models over much
of the nation days 3-7, bolstering forecast confidence. A
composite blend is preferred to smooth out the less predictable
smaller scale differences consistent with uncertainties.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Strengthening Henri looms over a highly settled Western Atlantic
and the latest NHC track increasingly threatens New England this
weekend with potential for enhanced winds/waves and rainfall.
Again, please refer to the latest NHC advisories for updated
forecasts.

Upstream, amplified upper trough energies will steadily progress
from the Northwest to the north-central U.S. then Great
Lakes/Midwest this weekend into next week and spread potential for
moderate amounts of lead convection/rainfall that may produce more
local heavier amounts. Some high elevation snows are possible in
this pattern for a cooled Northern Rockies with the approach and
passage of the aforementioned upper troughs and associated frontal
system and low developments and progression across this broad
region. Meanwhile underneath, an upper ridge/high that is forecast
to extend across the south-central U.S/South will support a
protracted period of hot and humid temperatures over this broad
region.

...Additional flash flooding and severe weather anticipated in the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic associated with Post-Tropical Cyclone Fred..

...Much cooler and wetter conditions are forecast for the
West/Northern Plains over the next couple of days...

Fred has finally transitioned to a post-tropical cyclone this
morning as it tracks into the Northeast today, shifting the threat
of heavy rainfall and severe weather into the Northeast and
Mid-Atlantic through Friday. The greatest threat of heavy rain and
excessive rain today remains focused over the Moderate Risk area
in North Pennsylvania and South-Central New York, where numerous
instances of flash flooding can be expected as repeated rounds of
thunderstorms fall over the same area. Outside of the Moderate
Risk, scattered flash flooding is anticipated over a broad area
including much of the Mid-Atlantic and eastern Carolinas given the
antecedent heavy rainfall in the region. The same thunderstorms
responsible for heavy rain may also produce severe weather today,
reflected by a Slight Risk of severe storms across the Northeast
and Mid-Atlantic today for a few tornadoes and some gusty winds.
By tomorrow, lingering hazardous weather associated with remnants
of Fred will migrate into New England, where scattered flash
floods and isolated tornadoes are possible with thunderstorm
activity over the area. What is left of Fred should exit northern
New England on Saturday, leaving scattered thunderstorms and
isolated flash flood chances in its wake from the Northeast toward
the Tennessee as a front/trough lingers around.

In the West, a potent cold front pushed by an upper-level low will
meander through the Northern High Plains back into the southern
Great Basin through tonight, likely pushing past the Central
Rockies later on Thursday. The interaction with the front and
associated upper low with monsoonal moisture pooling over the West
will lead to showers and thunderstorms across much of the interior
regions. Marginal to Slight Risks of excessive rainfall are in
place across central parts of the Four Corners states to the
Wyoming/Colorado border, and a Marginal Risk extends just north of
the Four Corners into the Rockies and Northern Plains tomorrow.
Some severe storms capable of producing strong wind gusts are also
possible today over Central Utah, before the severe threat shifts
to the Central High Plains on Thursday for wind and hail threats.
The strong front will provide some much needed relief from the
recent brutal heat in parts of the West; high temperatures pushing
30 degrees below average are possible today, particularly today in
Montana. Milder than normal temperatures also stretch into the
Great Basin and toward the Southwest today, with the Central
Rockies seeing cooler temperatures on Thursday as the cold front
pushes eastward. The very cool temperatures will moderate slightly
going into the weekend, but will generally remain at or below
average through the short-range forecast period. Unfortunately,
poor air quality persists in portions of the West despite the
cooldown.

Ahead of the cold front in the Central U.S., hot temperatures in
the 90s and nearing 100F in some areas are again expected for the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest. Moreover, shower and
thunderstorms ahead of the front could produce some flash flooding
on Friday in the Northern Plains where a Slight Risk of excessive
rain is in effect. Below average high temperatures can be expected
in the Northern Plains on Saturday behind the front.

...Henri to intensify to Hurricane status and threaten parts of
New England by Sunday and Monday...


...Overall weather pattern...

A rather active upper level pattern will be in place across the
northern tier states and southern Canada with several well
developed shortwaves moving through.  A building upper level ridge
will continue to build across the southern tier states and the
northern Gulf of Mexico, and the core of the upper high is
expected to retrograde westward through early next week.
Meanwhile, Henri is expected to come uncomfortably close to
eastern New England by late Sunday and into Monday with gusty
winds and heavy rainfall possible.


...Model analysis and preferences...

Models and ensembles are initially in good overall synoptic scale
agreement across most of the continental U.S. on Sunday.
Noteworthy differences become apparent by Tuesday across the
north-central U.S. with a strong shortwave perturbation near the
Canadian border, with the GFS indicating a considerably faster
solution than the better clustered CMC/ECMWF/ECENS, and the GFS is
also faster than its ensemble mean.  The GFS is also stronger with
a trough building near the West Coast by next Thursday and is out
of phase by having a ridge over the Upper Midwest compared to the
other guidance.  Taking these factors into account, the WPC
fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a non-GFS
blend, although some of the 18Z GEFS mean was incorporated by the
second half of the forecast period.

In regards to Henri, the main factor determining its eventual
track near New England will be the strength of the blocking upper
ridge over eastern Canada and a weak upper low over the
Mid-Atlantic region.  The trend over the past 48 hours has been
farther west and this brings the storm very close to Cape Cod
owing to a stronger ridge to the northeast.  The 00Z UKMET is the
farthest west over New England, whilst the ECMWF still maintains a
weaker storm by the time it reaches this region.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Bad weather is becoming more likely for eastern New England by
Sunday afternoon as Henri approaches from the south and comes
close enough to produce heavy rain, strong winds, and coastal
flooding from Rhode Island to southern Maine.  It is important to
note that future adjustments in the track can be expected, and the
impacts will become more predictable in the days ahead.  The
National Hurricane Center has the latest information pertaining to
this storm.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., amplified shortwave troughs
will steadily progress from the Pacific Northwest to the
north-central U.S., and then the Great Lakes next week, and these
will lead to the potential for scattered to perhaps numerous
showers and storms, some of which could be strong or severe where
convective complexes develop.  In the temperature department,
highs are expected to be about 5-15 degrees below normal from the
Northern Rockies to the Northern Plains, and up to 10 degrees
above normal for much of the central and southern U.S. that will
be under the influence of the upper ridge, along with plenty of
humidity.

...Henri to intensify to Hurricane status and threaten parts of
New England by Sunday and Monday...


...Overall weather pattern...

A rather active upper level pattern will be in place across the
northern tier states and southern Canada with several well
developed shortwaves moving through.  A building upper level ridge
will continue to build across the southern tier states and the
northern Gulf of Mexico, and the core of the upper high is
expected to retrograde westward through early next week.
Meanwhile, Henri is expected to come uncomfortably close to
eastern New England by late Sunday and into Monday with gusty
winds and heavy rainfall possible.


...Model analysis and preferences...

Models and ensembles are initially in good overall synoptic scale
agreement across most of the continental U.S. on Sunday.
Noteworthy differences become apparent by Tuesday across the
north-central U.S. with a strong shortwave perturbation near the
Canadian border, with the GFS indicating a considerably faster
solution than the better clustered CMC/ECMWF/ECENS, and the GFS is
also faster than its ensemble mean.  The GFS is also stronger with
a trough building near the West Coast by next Thursday and is out
of phase by having a ridge over the Upper Midwest compared to the
other guidance.  Taking these factors into account, the WPC
fronts/pressures forecast was primarily derived from a non-GFS
blend, although some of the 18Z GEFS mean was incorporated by the
second half of the forecast period.

In regards to Henri, the main factor determining its eventual
track near New England will be the strength of the blocking upper
ridge over eastern Canada and a weak upper low over the
Mid-Atlantic region.  The trend over the past 48 hours has been
farther west and this brings the storm very close to Cape Cod
owing to a stronger ridge to the northeast.  The 00Z UKMET is the
farthest west over New England, whilst the ECMWF still maintains a
weaker storm by the time it reaches this region.


...Sensible weather and potential hazards...

Bad weather is becoming more likely for eastern New England by
Sunday afternoon as Henri approaches from the south and comes
close enough to produce heavy rain, strong winds, and coastal
flooding from Rhode Island to southern Maine.  It is important to
note that future adjustments in the track can be expected, and the
impacts will become more predictable in the days ahead.  The
National Hurricane Center has the latest information pertaining to
this storm.

Elsewhere across the continental U.S., amplified shortwave troughs
will steadily progress from the Pacific Northwest to the
north-central U.S., and then the Great Lakes next week, and these
will lead to the potential for scattered to perhaps numerous
showers and storms, some of which could be strong or severe where
convective complexes develop.  In the temperature department,
highs are expected to be about 5-15 degrees below normal from the
Northern Rockies to the Northern Plains, and up to 10 degrees
above normal for much of the central and southern U.S. that will
be under the influence of the upper ridge, along with plenty of
humidity.

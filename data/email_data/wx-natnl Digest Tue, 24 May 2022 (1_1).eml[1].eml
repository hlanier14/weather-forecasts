Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 231700Z - 241200Z

Elevated fire-weather conditions are possible in the Sacramento
Valley this afternoon, as enhanced northerly mid-level flow over the
region mixes toward the surface, resulting in sustained winds of
15-20 mph and RH values into the teens. The persistent dry pattern
across the region is resulting in increasing fuel receptiveness,
with a notable continued upward trend in ERC percentages being
observed (now exceeding 80%). The elevated area has been confined to
areas where fuels appear to be receptive to large-fire spread,
particularly along the adjacent foothills.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

the Southwest and southern High Plains, driven by both dry/windy
conditions and the potential for isolated dry thunderstorms.
Early-morning satellite imagery shows evidence of broad-scale ascent
over the High Plains ahead of an approaching upper-level disturbance
(currently over northern Mexico). The overall upper-level pattern is
forecast amplify over the next 24 hours, which will support the
development of a surface cyclone over the southern High Plains and
increase thunderstorm chances east of the Rockies.

...Southwest...
Modest pressure falls are noted at several surface stations across
NM and adjacent areas of TX, CO, and OK. This trend will continue
through the day as a surface low deepens over the southern High
Plains, augmenting pressure-gradient winds in the process. Ensemble
guidance maintains reasonably high probability for 15-20 mph winds
with RH values falling into the 10-15% range by mid afternoon. As
such, widespread elevated conditions are expected from northern and
eastern AZ into central NM. Areas of critical conditions are
possible, especially along the I-25 corridor in southern NM where
the potential for sustained 20+ mph winds is highest based on
drier/windier solutions. However, spread in deterministic guidance
and poor fuel loading across the desert terrain limit confidence in
sustaining widespread critical conditions. Confidence in the
coverage and duration of the wind-driven fire weather threat is also
limited across northern NM due to the potential for widespread
clouds and scattered showers.

...Southern High Plains/Dry Thunderstorms...
00 UTC soundings across NM and TX reveal the onset of low to
mid-level moisture return into the region. This trend will continue
for the next 24 hours with PWAT values between 0.5 to 1.0 expected
across central NM to west TX by this afternoon. Thunderstorms
developing off the terrain of the southern Rockies will likely
mature within this moisture gradient and over a region with
receptive fuels. Dry sub-cloud layers and fast (25-30 knot) storm
motions will support a dry-lightning threat with initial
thunderstorm activity. Rainfall rates will intensify as storms move
to the east into the better moisture, so the spatial extent of the
dry lightning potential may be limited to a narrow strip across
eastern NM into far southeast CO.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN ARIZONA INTO CENTRAL NEW
MEXICO AND FAR SOUTHWEST TEXAS...

A westward expansion was made to the area delineating potential for
isolated dry thunderstorms into portions of central New Mexico. The
latest HREF/calibrated guidance indicates potential for storms to
develop farther west than previously indicated. In fact, there is
some potential for storms to develop farther west, extending into
the critical wind/RH area, but confidence is too low to extend
farther west at this time. Coverage of storms and associated wetting
rains on D1/Monday will also be a consideration for refinements, so
this area will continue to be monitored for adjustments in
forthcoming outlooks.

Additionally, a small expansion was made to the elevated area over
the Sacramento Valley to include the adjacent foothills. Fuels will
continue to cure across the region today, further supporting the
elevated delineation.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 05/23/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0204 AM CDT Mon May 23 2022/

...Synopsis...
Strengthening winds across the southwestern CONUS will result in
increasing fire weather concerns from the Four Corners into the
southern High Plains Tuesday afternoon. An overall amplification of
the current upper-level flow regime is expected heading into the
middle of the work week, as a strong northwesterly jet begins to
dive into the southern U.S. The approach of the upper jet will act
to deepen a surface low across the southern High Plains, which will
not only augment the regional pressure gradient, but also support a
southward surge of a modest cold front across the OK/TX Panhandles
and northeast NM. The resultant surface pattern will see strong
northwesterly flow across much of the Four Corners and Southwest,
but also an upslope flow regime across northeast NM/southern CO that
will support thunderstorm development late in the afternoon.

...Four Corners/Southwest...
The deepening surface low across southeast NM/southwest TX will
support sustained winds between 15-25 mph across a broad stretch of
the Four Corners/Southwest region. Flow within the 850-700 mb layer
will be stronger compared to previous days, which will support a
higher potential for sustained critical conditions across a broad
area. Short- and medium-range ensemble guidance reflects this idea
with fairly high probabilities for 20+ mph winds and 5-15% RH across
far eastern AZ into central NM Tuesday afternoon. A few locations
may experience brief periods of extremely critical conditions as
winds gust to 30-35 mph with RH values below 10% during peak daytime
heating. The fire weather across the Trans Pecos and Big Bend region
of southwest TX is somewhat conditional due to the potential for
wetting rainfall early Tuesday morning. Elevated conditions are
likely for these regions Tuesday afternoon, and an expansion may be
warranted depending on precipitation totals by Tuesday morning.

...Sacramento Valley...
The north to northwesterly flow regime over northern CA will support
adiabatic drying and warming through the Sacramento Valley Tuesday
afternoon. Ensemble guidance suggests wind speeds will generally be
stronger than previous days due to the better flow aloft. Afternoon
minimum RH values are forecast to fall into the low to mid teens
once again, supporting at least elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northeast New Mexico/Dry Thunderstorms...
Despite some degree of convective overturning during the prior 24
hours, mid-level lapse rates along the eastern Rockies are forecast
to remain somewhat steep (near 7 C/km). Residual boundary-layer
moisture is forecast to remain in place and support upwards of
500-1000 J/kg MUCAPE across the High Plains by Tuesday afternoon.
Thunderstorms initiating within the post-frontal upslope-flow regime
will likely reside on the periphery of the richer boundary-layer
moisture with PWAT values near 0.5 inches. While the dry sub-cloud
layer will be somewhat shallow, the limited moisture available for
initial thunderstorms and 20-30 knot storm motions will support a
dry-lightning potential. Fuels across northeast NM and far southern
CO are currently critically dry, and should remain so barring
wetting rainfall late Monday into early Tuesday.

259 PM EDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 12Z Thu May 26 2022 - 12Z Mon May 30 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough (with possible embedded closed low)
will be crossing the east-central U.S. through the end of the work
week, and this will sustain a surface cold front that will track
eastward and should exit the East Coast by the weekend. Meanwhile,
another trough enters the northwestern U.S. by the end of the week
with a brief upper ridge ahead of it across the Intermountain West
and Rockies. Models suggest this trough will deepen as it crosses
the West this weekend to spur surface cyclogenesis across the
northern Plains this weekend. In response to the digging upper
trough, an upper ridge should build across the eastern U.S. along
with warmer temperatures.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00z suite of model guidance has generally trended slower and
more amplified with the deep trough through the eastern third of
the nation as the period begins with indications of a closed low
over into the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic around Friday-Saturday. The
exception to this is the 00z/12z ECMWF which continues to be much
quicker and weaker, allowing for ridging to build in much faster
behind early next week. The timing in the ensemble means general
follow with their deterministic counterparts (albeit weaker) so
there continues to be a lot of uncertainty surrounding this
feature. Given the trends though, the WPC progs do depict a
slower/more amplified system compared to previous WPC continuity,
with a proxy closest to the 00z/12z CMC (which is a nice middle
ground between the stronger GFS and the weaker ECMWF).

Out West, the guidance shows good timing agreement on the initial
shortwave into the West late this week, but differ with the
evolution into the weekend. The CMC (and UKMET through day 5) are
faster and stronger with this leading shortwave developing a
closed low over south-central Canada by Sunday. Meanwhile, the GFS
and ECMWF aren't as strong with this shortwave as it crosses the
West, instead wanting to develop and deepen the next shortwave
into the coast around Sunday. The WPC forecast trended towards the
ensemble means the second half of the period to account for this
uncertainty and generally shows good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Thursday and Friday across portions of the Eastern U.S.
along and ahead of the cold front, with heavy to excessive
rainfall possible in some areas particularly across the Southeast.
A Slight Risk area in the Day 4 experimental excessive rainfall
outlook is highlighted from far northern Georgia to southwestern
North Carolina where the best orographic forcing will be present
in a moist environment. Late week into next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and
thunderstorms (and perhaps some late May mountain snows) from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies. Storms should emerge
over the central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest next weekend
as the low progresses eastward.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region in the
wake of the cold front for the end of the week, followed by a
warm-up with above normal highs returning by the weekend across
much of the Plains, with 90s likely as far north as central
Nebraska, and even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.
Hot weather is also expected for the lower elevations of the
Desert Southwest for Thursday through the weekend as an upper
level ridge is expected to be in place, although a cooling trend
will commence for the inland valleys of central California.
Elsewhere, expect highs to generally be within 5 degrees of
climatological averages across most of the eastern U.S. through
Saturday, although overnight lows could end up being milder than
usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity. Heat returns to much
of the Northeast U.S. and Ohio Valley by early next week as the
upper ridge builds back in.

300 PM EDT May 23 2022

SYNOPSIS: Mid-level low (high) pressure is favored over the western (easter=
n)
half of the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) during week-2. This favors a more activ=
e
storm pattern throughout the period from the Great Plains to the Eastern
Seaboard. As a series of storms intensify and move eastward, they could bri=
ng
high winds to parts of the Southern Plains. Through the middle of week-2, t=
he
potential for excessive heat dissipates across the south-central CONUS, but
briefly emerges in California=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs Central Valley. C=
onversely, a surface low
pressure system moving eastward across the northern CONUS early in week-2
supports an increased likelihood of much below-normal temperatures across
parts
of the Northern Plains. Flooding risks remain across the Red River of the
North, northern Minnesota, and along the Tanana River in eastern Mainland
Alaska.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Southern High Plains and
Middle Rio Grande Valley, Tue, May 31.

Slight risk of excessive heat for the Southern High Plains, Tue, May 31.

Slight risk of excessive heat for the Central Valley of California, Tue-Thu=
,
May 31-Jun 2.

Slight risk of much below-normal minimum temperatures across parts of the
Northern Plains, Tue-Thu, May 31-Jun 2.

Slight risk of episodes of high winds across the parts of the Southern Plai=
ns,
Tue-Mon, May 31-Jun 6.

Flooding possible along parts of the Red River of the North.

Flooding possible in parts of northern Minnesota.

Flooding possible for parts of the Tanana River Basin in eastern Mainland
Alaska.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR THURSDAY MAY 26 - MONDAY MAY 30:

RAcL2YQuZqLSaFwcPKyDj11yd0HrZs$

FOR TUESDAY MAY 31 - MONDAY JUNE 06: Models are in good general agreement,
depicting a weak mean mid-level trough (ridge) pattern across the western
(eastern) CONUS during week-2. Early in week-2, the heat in the Southern
Plains
(extending from week-1 into week-2) is forecast to dissipate (by day 9, Jun
1).
Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance for maximum temperatures to exceed the 85th percentile of the
historical
distribution and 95=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF over many of the Southern High Plain=
s for day 8 (May
31).
As such, a slight risk for excessive heat is posted May 31 for this region.=
 A
moderate risk of excessive heat is also posted May 31 near the Trans-Pecos =
and
Edwards Plateau regions in Texas, where there is more than a 20% chance of
maximum temperatures exceeding 100=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF. This will add to the=
 already record
number of days of exceeding 100=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF during the month of May =
for several
locations
in the moderate risk area.



Farther West, a slight risk of excessive heat is posted for all of
California=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs
Central Valley, May 31-Jun 2, where there is at least a 30% chance of maxim=
um
temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile, with much of the area having at
least a 20% chance of exceeding 95=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF. Some locations in th=
e San Joaquin
Valley
also have the potential to exceed 100=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF. The signal dimini=
shes in intensity
over time, with the higher probabilities shifting southward during this 3-d=
ay
period. Therefore, the excessive heat potential is reduced for much of the
northern Sacramento Valley by Jun 3, compared to areas farther south.



Conversely, a slight risk of much below-normal temperatures is posted May
31-Jun 2 across the Northern Plains, associated with a storm system exiting
the
region early in week-2. Reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling below the 15th percentile of the historical
distribution and 40=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDF.



Along the leading edge of the mean (over the course of week-2) mid-level
trough
over the western CONUS, a series of low pressure systems are likely to ejec=
t
out of the Rockies and move northeastward, which could bring increased chan=
ces
for high winds to parts of the Southern Plains. Although the GEFS and ECMWF
ensemble reforecast tools indicate mixed intensities in their respective
signals, the long-wave pattern is favorable for windy conditions associated
with storm systems that amplify over the Great Plains. As such, a slight ri=
sk
for episodes high winds is posted throughout the entirety of week-2, as the
pattern is favored to remain active for the eastern two-thirds of the CONUS=
.



With ongoing river flooding along the Red River of the North, Northern
Minnesota, and the Tanana River Basin in eastern Mainland Alaska, and favor=
ed
above-normal precipitation during week-2, flooding risks remain along those
basins.



Despite both the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble models favoring anywhere from 1.5 =
to
2
inches of rainfall throughout the entirety of week-2 over parts of the
north-central CONUS, day-to-day amounts are not likely to be hazardous in
nature. Additionally, both models indicate the potential for a surge of
moisture from the Gulf of Mexico making its way into parts of the Four Corn=
ers
toward the middle of week-2. However, ensemble precipitation estimates in b=
oth
models are not indicative of hazardous potential in this region, as 3-day
rainfall estimates are favored to remain below 0.5 inches. Therefore, there
are
no precipitation hazards posted anywhere in the lower 48 at this time.

...Heavy Rain, Flash Flooding and Severe Weather possible from the
Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley...

...A Fire Weather Threat to continue across the Southern High
Plains, portions of the Southwest and northern California...

...Heat builds across interior California and the Great Basin,
while much of the Plains and Mid-Atlantic to see below average
temperatures...

A slow moving storm system is expected to develop across the
Central to Southern High Plains Monday night, setting the stage
for a multi-day heavy rainfall event affecting much of the Central
to Southern Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley regions.  Large
portions of the Central to Southern Plains, primarily the western
portions, are in an extreme to exceptional drought, with some
overlap expected to these drought areas and the areas of expected
heavy precipitation.   The eastern portions of the Central to
Southern Plains have fared better recently with precipitation and
are not in as severe drought conditions.  Either way, however, the
slow movement of this storm system will bring the risk of Flash
Flooding across portions of the Central and Southern Plains from
Monday night into early Wednesday and the threat of flash flooding
across the Lower Mississippi Valley during Wednesday.  In addition
to the heavy rains and flash flood threat across these regions,
severe weather is also possible with large hail and high winds the
greatest threats, but also a threat of tornadoes.

The wet weather pattern across the mid section of the nation will
support colder than average temperatures for the next few days.
The core of the much below average temperatures on Tuesday will be
centered over the Central to Southern High Plains from western
Kansas into southeastern Colorado, northeast New Mexico and into
the Texas/Oklahoma Panhandle region, with high temperatures 20 to
30 degrees below average.  Below average temperatures are expected
to stretch across a larger region of the mid section of the nation
on Wednesday, but temperatures are not expected to be as cold as
Tuesday, generally in the 10 to 20 degree below average range.
Below average temperatures also expected to persist across the
Mid-Atlantic over the next few days.  Many locations will be 20 to
25 degrees F cooler than this past weekend when temperatures were
in the low to middle 90s.

While temperatures will be colder than average across the mid
section of the nation and Mid-Atlantic, heat will be building
across interior California into the Great Basin this week.
Temperatures by Wednesday are expected to reach the lower 100s
through the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys, which will be near
the record highs for this date.  The hot/dry weather will also
increase the fire weather danger across the northern Sacramento
Valley.  No let up to the persistent fire weather threat over
portions of the Southern High Plains into the Southwest.  These
areas will be to the west of where heavy rains are expected
through portions of the Southern Plains, with these areas
continuing to experience Severe to Exceptional drought conditions
and the resulting persistent fire weather threat.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon May 23 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 29 - JUN 02, 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement on =
the forecast mid-level
circulation pattern across the North American region. Ridges and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are forecast over Mainland Alaska and to the west =
of
the CONUS over the northeastern Pacific. A trough is forecast over the west=
ern
CONUS and a ridge is forecast over the eastern CONUS in recent ensemble mea=
n
and high resolution model forecasts. The GEFS ensemble mean predicts a
slightly
deeper trough over the western CONUS relative to the ECMWF ensemble mean.

Above normal temperatures are favored over much of Alaska, except for extre=
me
northern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of the Aleutians,
under positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favo=
red
over the southern Alaska Panhandle southeastward to the northwestern CONUS,
the
Central and Northern Rockies, and the Northern Plains, under the forecast
trough. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of California, unde=
r
positive 500-hPa height anomalies ahead of the ridge. Above normal
temperatures
are also favored for the Southern Plains and the eastern CONUS, under a
predicted ridge.

Below normal precipitation is slightly favored for the Aleutians and the
southwestern coast of Mainland Alaska, under a predicted ridge. Above norma=
l
precipitation is slightly favored for interior Mainland Alaska consistent w=
ith
dynamical model precipitation tools. Above normal precipitation is favored =
for
the southern Alaska Panhandle, as a low pressure system is forecast to
approach
the coast during the period in most model solutions. Below normal
precipitation
is favored for parts of California and the western Great Basin, ahead of th=
e
forecast ridge. Above normal precipitation is favored for the Pacific
Northwest, the Northern and Central Rockies, the Northern and Central Plain=
s,
and the western Great Lakes region, under and ahead of the forecast trough.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 0z GFS centered =
on
Day 8, 30% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 30% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=
od
model agreement, offset by some differences among the temperature and
precipitation forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAY 31 - JUN 06, 2022

The predicted circulation pattern for the 8-14 day period is generally simi=
lar
to the forecast pattern for the 6-10 day period, but with a reduction in
mid-level height anomalies in the ensemble means and the manual blend due t=
o a
significant increase in uncertainty. Positive height anomalies are indicate=
d
over the Aleutians with slightly positive anomalies extending northeastward
over Mainland Alaska in the manual blend. Negative 500-hPa height anomalies
are
forecast over the Alaska Panhandle in the ensemble means of the ECMWF, GEFS
and
Canadian models. Weak troughing and negative 500-hPa height anomalies exten=
d
into the northwestern CONUS in the week-2 period. A weak ridge and positive
500-hPa height anomalies are depicted over much of the eastern CONUS. Near
average mid-level heights are forecast over the Gulf Coast.

Above normal temperatures are slightly favored over much of the Aleutians a=
nd
Mainland Alaska under slightly positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Below nor=
mal
temperatures are favored for the southern Alaska Panhandle, under negative
500-hPa height anomalies. Below normal temperatures are favored for the
northwestern and north-central CONUS under the predicted trough, early in t=
he
period. Above normal temperatures are favored for parts of California, ahea=
d
of
the predicted ridge early in the period. Above normal temperatures are favo=
red
for eastern areas of the Southwest, the Southern Plains, the Lower Mississi=
ppi
Valley, and much of the eastern CONUS, consistent with the temperature
consolidation tool.

Above normal precipitation is slightly favored for interior Mainland Alaska=
,
consistent with the dynamical model forecasts, under southerly flow. Above
normal precipitation is favored for the southern Alaska Panhandle, as a sys=
tem
is forecast to approach the coast early in the period. Above normal
precipitation is favored for parts of the Pacific Northwest, under a predic=
ted
trough. Below normal precipitation is favored for parts of California and t=
he
western Great Basin, ahead of the ridge. With increasing uncertainty during
the
period, above normal precipitation is slightly favored for most areas of th=
e
CONUS to the east of the Rocky Mountains, excluding parts of the Northeast,
consistent with the precipitation consolidation tool. Probabilities of abov=
e
normal precipitation are increased over the western Gulf Coast region and t=
he
southern Florida Peninsula, with increased moisture flow from the Gulf of
Mexico and the Atlantic.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
predicted weak mean 500-hPa anomalies across most of the forecast domain an=
d
weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools over most regions.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 16.

422 PM EDT Mon May 23 2022

Valid 12Z Thu May 26 2022 - 12Z Mon May 30 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough (with possible embedded closed low)
will be crossing the east-central U.S. through the end of the work
week, and this will sustain a surface cold front that will track
eastward and should exit the East Coast by the weekend. Meanwhile,
another trough enters the northwestern U.S. by the end of the week
with a brief upper ridge ahead of it across the Intermountain West
and Rockies. Models suggest this trough will deepen as it crosses
the West this weekend to spur surface cyclogenesis across the
northern Plains this weekend. In response to the digging upper
trough, an upper ridge should build across the eastern U.S. along
with warmer temperatures.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00z suite of model guidance has generally trended slower and
more amplified with the deep trough through the eastern third of
the nation as the period begins with indications of a closed low
over into the Ohio Valley/Mid-Atlantic around Friday-Saturday. The
exception to this is the 00z/12z ECMWF which continues to be much
quicker and weaker, allowing for ridging to build in much faster
behind early next week. The timing in the ensemble means general
follow with their deterministic counterparts (albeit weaker) so
there continues to be a lot of uncertainty surrounding this
feature. Given the trends though, the WPC progs do depict a
slower/more amplified system compared to previous WPC continuity,
with a proxy closest to the 00z/12z CMC (which is a nice middle
ground between the stronger GFS and the weaker ECMWF).

Out West, the guidance shows good timing agreement on the initial
shortwave into the West late this week, but differ with the
evolution into the weekend. The CMC (and UKMET through day 5) are
faster and stronger with this leading shortwave developing a
closed low over south-central Canada by Sunday. Meanwhile, the GFS
and ECMWF aren't as strong with this shortwave as it crosses the
West, instead wanting to develop and deepen the next shortwave
into the coast around Sunday. The WPC forecast trended towards the
ensemble means the second half of the period to account for this
uncertainty and generally shows good continuity with the previous
WPC forecast as well.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

Periods of heavy rainfall will continue to make weather headlines
going into Thursday and Friday across portions of the Eastern U.S.
along and ahead of the cold front, with heavy to excessive
rainfall possible in some areas particularly across the Southeast.
A Slight Risk area in the Day 4 experimental excessive rainfall
outlook is highlighted from far northern Georgia to southwestern
North Carolina where the best orographic forcing will be present
in a moist environment. Late week into next weekend, the front
moving inland across the northwestern U.S. and eventually the
central/northern Plains is expected to bring some showers and
thunderstorms (and perhaps some late May mountain snows) from the
Pacific Northwest to the Northern Rockies. Storms should emerge
over the central/northern Plains to the Upper Midwest next weekend
as the low progresses eastward.

In terms of temperatures, pleasantly cool conditions can be
expected across much of the Midwest and Great Lakes region in the
wake of the cold front for the end of the week, followed by a
warm-up with above normal highs returning by the weekend across
much of the Plains, with 90s likely as far north as central
Nebraska, and even some low 100s for portions of western Texas.
Hot weather is also expected for the lower elevations of the
Desert Southwest for Thursday through the weekend as an upper
level ridge is expected to be in place, although a cooling trend
will commence for the inland valleys of central California.
Elsewhere, expect highs to generally be within 5 degrees of
climatological averages across most of the eastern U.S. through
Saturday, although overnight lows could end up being milder than
usual owing to more cloud cover and humidity. Heat returns to much
of the Northeast U.S. and Ohio Valley by early next week as the
upper ridge builds back in.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0111 AM CDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 241200Z - 251200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR FOUR CORNERS INTO FAR WEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
Critical fire weather conditions are expected across a broad swath
of the Four Corners region into southern New Mexico and far west
Texas. An upper-level jet continues to nose into the southern
Plains, deepening a surface low over southeast NM/southwest TX and
enhancing mid-level flow over the greater Southwest region where
fuels remain critically dry. This feature will also support
thunderstorm chances across parts of the southern High Plains this
afternoon, which will pose a threat for isolated dry thunderstorms.

...Four Corners into Far West Texas...
Critical conditions remain likely as surface and boundary-layer
winds strengthen through the day. Despite modest overnight RH
recovery across parts of AZ and NM, drier conditions are noted
upstream in low-level water-vapor imagery and 00 UTC RAOBs. The
southeastward advection of this drier air mass coupled with diurnal
warming will result in widespread 5-15% RH values. Ensemble guidance
continues to show high probability for 20-25 mph sustained winds
from the Four Corners region into west TX. A few locations may see
periodic extremely critical conditions where RH values between 5-10%
are coincident with 30-40 mph wind gusts. While some spread in
deterministic solutions is noted, this potential may be maximized
across the Gila River region of southwest NM into far west TX.

...Dry Thunderstorms...
Although some parts of northeast NM observed wetting rainfall over
the past 24 hours, most locations remain dry with receptive fuels.
00 UTC observed soundings from ABQ and DEN sampled PWAT values less
than 0.6 inches from the periphery of the moist plume over the
southern Plains. Despite this limited moisture, mid-level lapse
rates remain sufficiently steep (near 8 C/km) to support 100-500
J/kg MUCAPE this afternoon given adequate boundary-layer heating.
Thunderstorms are expected to develop by late afternoon within an
upslope-flow regime across northeast NM into southern CO. Fast storm
motions coupled the limited available moisture will support a dry
thunderstorm threat.

...Sacramento Valley...
Recent surface observations reveal an elongated surface trough
through central CA, resulting in northerly pressure-gradient winds
through the Sacramento Valley. Winds will increase again through the
afternoon, likely reaching top sustained speeds near 15 mph. Dry
conditions will persist and downslope warming/drying will foster
another day of 15-20% RH, resulting in elevated fire weather
conditions.

...Heavy Rain, Flash Flooding, and Severe Weather possible from
the Southern Plains into the Lower Mississippi Valley and
Mid-South...

...A Fire Weather Threat to continue across portions of the
Southwest and northern California...

...Record highs possible in portions of California...

An area of low pressure near the Texas/Oklahoma border today will
slowly lift out of the Southern Plains tomorrow and eventually
move into the Great Lakes region by early Thursday. Southerly flow
out of the Gulf ahead of the cold front arcing back across Texas
will provide sufficient moisture in a primed atmosphere to support
showers and thunderstorms each day. Some storms may be severe,
with a threat of hail, damaging winds, and a few tornadoes. In
addition, heavy rain is possible in many thunderstorms which may
result in runoff issues and a flash flooding threat, especially in
urban areas. Some thunderstorms and heavy rain may continue
overnight as well from the northwest to southeast across Texas
tonight into Wednesday morning. On Wednesday, the risk of severe
weather will shift into the Midwest southward through the
Mid-South to the Gulf Coast.

A more modest area of rain over the Central Plains will push
toward the northeast today into Wednesday, reaching the Great
Lakes tomorrow morning. Temperatures will be chilly from Colorado
eastward to the Corn Belt where readings may only top out around
50 to near 60, which is about 15-25 degrees below normal. Farther
west, much of California away from the immediate coast will see
well above normal temperatures today and Wednesday, when the heat
will extend into Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona. Some locations could
see record highs around 100-105F through the Sacramento and San
Joaquin Valleys.

The hot/dry weather will also increase the fire weather danger
across the northern Sacramento Valley where Red Flag Warnings will
be in effect Monday morning through Wednesday morning. Over much
of western New Mexico, breezy conditions with low relative
humidity values support a Critical Fire Risk today.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0140 AM CDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 251200Z - 261200Z

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will persist into Wednesday afternoon for
portions of the Southwest, but will generally be more limited
compared to previous days. A northwesterly flow regime will maintain
dry and breezy conditions across the Four Corners into parts of far
west Texas. Critically dry fuels will undergo further curing on
Tuesday, and remain dry through the day Wednesday, supporting the
fire weather potential.

...New Mexico to far west Texas...
Winds over the Southwest will generally abate heading into Wednesday
as the upper-level trough and attendant surface low shift to the
east. However, 20 mph northwesterly winds will linger within the
850-700 mb layer. Boundary-layer deepening through the day should
easily mix these winds to the surface, yielding sustained 15-20 mph
winds with occasional gusts to 25-30 mph. Little moisture return
into the region will maintain dry conditions with widespread 5-15%
RH values likely. Consequently, areas of elevated fire weather
conditions are expected from northwest NM into far west TX. A few
locations may see 2-3 hours of Critical conditions, especially in
the lee of terrain features where topographically enhanced winds may
exceed 20 mph. However, this potential appears too limited at this
time for additional highlights.

Extended Forecast Discussion

255 AM EDT Tue May 24 2022

Valid 12Z Fri May 27 2022 - 12Z Tue May 31 2022

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A large scale upper trough with a possible embedded closed low
will be crossing the eastern U.S. through Friday and into
Saturday, and this will sustain a surface cold front that should
exit the East Coast by the weekend.  Meanwhile, another trough
enters the northwestern U.S. by the end of the week with a brief
upper ridge ahead of it across the Rockies and the High Plains.
Models suggest this trough will deepen as it crosses the West this
weekend with surface cyclogenesis across the northern Plains this
weekend.  In response to the digging upper trough, an upper ridge
should build across the eastern U.S. along with warmer
temperatures.  This general amplified pattern is forecast to
persist into early next week.

...Model Guidance and Preferences...

The 00Z model guidance is trending more towards a slower and
potentially closed upper low solution across the Ohio Valley for
the Friday-Saturday time period, with the past few runs of the GFS
consistently on the slower side of the model consensus.  The CMC
is now on the faster side and has less of a closed low signal
compared to the ECMWF/GFS/UKMET.  Therefore, the WPC forecast
through Saturday focused more towards the ECMWF/CMC/UKMET as a
starting point.  Out West, the guidance shows good timing
agreement on the initial shortwave into the West late this week,
but differ with the evolution into the weekend, with the GFS
stronger and the CMC/ECMWF a little slower.  The WPC forecast
trended towards the ensemble means for the second half of the
period to account for this uncertainty and generally shows good
continuity with the previous WPC forecast as well.

...Sensible Weather/Threat Highlights...

The majority of the heavy rainfall should be over by Friday,
although a corridor of showers and storms is expected across the
East Coast states ahead of a weakening cold front.  There is the
potential for some repeated rounds of convection with heavy rain
across portions of the Carolinas based on some of the latest model
guidance, but right now the potential for any flooding appears
marginal.  Patchy areas of heavy rainfall are also possible across
portions of the Northeast, although the system should be more
progressive here.  By this weekend, showers and storms increase in
coverage across the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest in response
to a developing low pressure system over the north-central U.S.
Some late season high elevation snow is also possible across the
Northern Rockies for the Sunday and Monday time period.

Temperatures will warm up considerably across the Plains by the
end of the week with highs reaching well into the 90s from Kansas
to the Gulf Coast, and some low-mid 100s across western Texas.
The heat builds eastward to include the Ohio Valley and eventually
the East Coast through the weekend and into early next week,
compliments of the building upper ridge and southerly flow ahead
of the storm system over the Plains.  Much cooler weather arrives
for the Pacific Northwest by Friday, and the below normal
temperatures encompass the Northern Rockies and Northern Plains as
the upper trough moves in behind the cold front.

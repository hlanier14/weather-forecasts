Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1033 AM CST Fri Mar 05 2021

Valid 051700Z - 061200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. In addition, briefly
Elevated to locally Critical winds/RH may occur by afternoon peak
heating immediately behind the cold front across portions of
south-central Texas, but the localized nature of these conditions
and the marginal receptiveness of fuels preclude any fire weather
highlights. In addition, a dry surface airmass, characterized by
20-35% RH, will reside across much of the Florida Peninsula this
afternoon. Despite the lack of rainfall across this area for the
past week, the danger for significant wildfire is expected to remain
relatively low today given light and variable surface winds. Lastly,
brief and locally Elevated conditions will be possible across
portions of southern Arizona into New Mexico as a dry boundary layer
continues to mix with daytime heating.

..Squitieri.. 03/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1255 AM CST Fri Mar 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
The fire weather potential will generally remain low today due to a
combination of recent rainfall and the southward progression of
cooler air over the Plains as well as marginal fuels elsewhere
across the CONUS. A few areas of transient elevated conditions are
possible (as noted below), but no robust fire weather concerns are
anticipated.

...West Texas...
Despite dry fuels from the Panhandle southward into west-central TX,
a cold front will continue to progress southward through the day,
and usher in cooler temperatures with higher relative humidity.
Breezy conditions are possible with northerly winds at 15-20 mph,
but the improved RH should mitigate most fire weather concerns.

...New England...
A dry, post-frontal air mass will continue to usher in dewpoints in
the single digits and low teens for today from the Chesapeake Bay
region northeastward into southern Connecticut. Relative humidity
values between 25-35% are possible and may coincide with breezy
15-25 mph winds. While elevated meteorological conditions are
possible, fuels across the region are not receptive due to either
snow cover or relatively high fuel moisture content.

...Central Nevada...
Surface pressure falls ahead of an approaching upper-level trough
will help increase southerly low-level winds through the day.
Downslope warming and drying off the Sierra Nevada will help
relative humidity values fall into the teens. Patchy elevated
meteorological conditions appear likely over central NV, and may
extend as far north as southeastern OR if conditions follow more
aggressive/drier model solutions. However, as with the Northeast,
fuels across this region appear too moist to support a significant
fire weather concern.

FOR SATURDAY MARCH 13 - FRIDAY MARCH 19: The 06z GEFS and 00z ECMWF are in
good
agreement regarding the mid-level troughing forecast to move into the weste=
rn
CONUS. Shortwave impulses are likely to propagate through the mean trough
axis,
enhancing precipitation chances (rain and high elevation snow) across porti=
ons
of the Pacific Northwest and California throughout the period. Exact timing
and
spatial coverage is uncertain, and the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools keep
probabilities under 20% in most places for 3-day precipitation exceeding th=
e
85th percentile. Therefore, no related precipitation hazards are depicted a=
t
this time.



The predicted trough over the western CONUS favors below normal temperature=
s
across the region. The strongest signal is confined to mostly California an=
d
the Southwest with probabilities around 20% of much below normal minimum
temperatures. A hazard has been issued for the first two days of the period
over this region. There is a chance that the cold continues into the middle=
 of
the period, but confidence of this happening is not high enough to warrant =
an
extension of the hazard.



This same trough axis is also forecast to result in one or more areas of
surface low pressure ejecting out of the Rockies during week-2. Impacts wil=
l
depend on the exact track and strength of the lows, but increased chances o=
f
heavy precipitation are forecast across portions of the Great Plains,
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Tennessee Valley, and the Ohio Valley wher=
e
the ECMWF and GEFS reforecast tools both have consistently depicted at leas=
t a
20% chance that 3-day precipitation totals will exceed the 85th percentile.=
 A
slight risk for heavy precipitation is posted across these regions for all =
of
week-2.



Wintry precipitation is possible on the northwestern side of these systems,
with increased frontal convergence and rain favored in the warm sector to t=
he
southeast of the surface low tracks. River flooding is ongoing across porti=
ons
of the Ohio River Valley. Although dry conditions are generally forecast pr=
ior
to the start of week-2, river levels may remain elevated in some areas, and
any
additional precipitation during week-2 could bring some areas back above fl=
ood
stage. Therefore a flooding possible hazard is depicted across the region.



A transient pattern is forecast across Alaska, with zonal flow developing
across the state and troughing upstream over the Bering Sea. This favors
multiple surface low pressure systems to impact the Aleutians and Mainland
Alaska during week-2. Given that temperatures are also likely to average be=
low
normal, increased snowfall is also favored across southwestern Mainland
Alaska.
The surface lows crossing the Bering Sea are likely to increase the risk of
high winds along the coast of the southwestern Mainland and over the
Aleutians,
however, wind speeds are not forecast to reach hazards thresholds.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
157 PM EST Fri Mar 05 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Mar 08 2021 - 12Z Fri Mar 12 2021

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Global models and ensembles agree very well that an amplified
eastern Pacific mean trough aloft will settle over the West next
week. This trough will support rain and higher elevation snow
along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Meanwhile by
Tuesday-Wednesday, a shortwave forecast to eject from the trough
will support a Plains low pressure system to spread a broad area
of precipitation across the central/east-central U.S.. There is a
general model trend toward larger separation between the northern
stream near/across the Canadian border and the developing low in
the Plains, resulting in a faster motion of the low heading into
Canada and a general northward trend of the rain axis across the
Midwest/Mid-MS Valley during the second half of next week.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will continue to
rise as ridging moves in from the central U.S. and an upper high
builds from Mexico into the Gulf. This will transition much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.
Forecast spread increases later next week with respect to upper
trough specifics in the West and frontal progressions over the
central and eastern states. This reduces above normal feature
predictability to more average levels.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was derived from a
composite of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS with
smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean. Beginning on Day
5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were used to
account for the increasing forecast uncertainty. Good WPC
continuity is maintained.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A good portion of the West has potential for at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period as a cool mean upper
trough settling in across the region. Heavier precipitation should
extend from southwestern Oregon through favored terrain in
California, with highest amounts most likely along the Sierra
Nevada.  Meaningful though more moderate precipitation is likely
across the Interior West and northern Rockies, with some snow
lingering into late week for the central Rockies. Energies
ejecting into the Plains should support a low pressure system that
tracks through the northern tier states from Tuesday onward, with
a broad area of precipitation extending across the northern Plains
to the Great Lakes into the interior Northeast, and down into the
Midwest and the Ohio Valley. Some wintry weather may be possible
over extreme northern locations. There may be locally moderate to
heavy rainfall from the Great Lakes/Midwest. The mid-MS Valley and
the southern Plains will be susceptible to the highest rainfall
totals and/or strongest convection fueled by Gulf inflow and
instability. Activity will mainly focus along a wavy cold front
that may tend to stall later in the period as upper troughing
settles over the West. This could lead to a pattern with enhanced
training.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and then expand into the Great Lakes through the
first part of next week with readings generally 10 to more than
25F above normal. Daily records should be more numerous for warm
lows than daytime highs.  Development and gradual progression of
the Plains/Midwest system and trailing front Tuesday onward will
slowly push this warmth more across the eastern half of the
country mid-late next week. Morning lows should remain as warm as
15-25F above normal and approach some record values while high
temperature anomalies should be less extreme. Meanwhile, the West
will experience a decent cooling trend spreading across the region
from west to east during the period with highs tending to drop to
5-10F or so below normal.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Global models and ensembles agree very well that an amplified
eastern Pacific mean trough aloft will settle over the West next
week. This trough will support rain and higher elevation snow
along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Meanwhile by
Tuesday-Wednesday, a shortwave forecast to eject from the trough
will support a Plains low pressure system to spread a broad area
of precipitation across the central/east-central U.S.. There is a
general model trend toward larger separation between the northern
stream near/across the Canadian border and the developing low in
the Plains, resulting in a faster motion of the low heading into
Canada and a general northward trend of the rain axis across the
Midwest/Mid-MS Valley during the second half of next week.

Ahead of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will continue to
rise as ridging moves in from the central U.S. and an upper high
builds from Mexico into the Gulf. This will transition much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.
Forecast spread increases later next week with respect to upper
trough specifics in the West and frontal progressions over the
central and eastern states. This reduces above normal feature
predictability to more average levels.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was derived from a
composite of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean and the 06Z GFS/GEFS with
smaller contributions from the 00Z CMC/CMC mean. Beginning on Day
5, more of the 06Z GEFS together with the 00Z EC mean were used to
account for the increasing forecast uncertainty. Good WPC
continuity is maintained.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

A good portion of the West has potential for at least some
rain/higher elevation snow during the period as a cool mean upper
trough settling in across the region. Heavier precipitation should
extend from southwestern Oregon through favored terrain in
California, with highest amounts most likely along the Sierra
Nevada.  Meaningful though more moderate precipitation is likely
across the Interior West and northern Rockies, with some snow
lingering into late week for the central Rockies. Energies
ejecting into the Plains should support a low pressure system that
tracks through the northern tier states from Tuesday onward, with
a broad area of precipitation extending across the northern Plains
to the Great Lakes into the interior Northeast, and down into the
Midwest and the Ohio Valley. Some wintry weather may be possible
over extreme northern locations. There may be locally moderate to
heavy rainfall from the Great Lakes/Midwest. The mid-MS Valley and
the southern Plains will be susceptible to the highest rainfall
totals and/or strongest convection fueled by Gulf inflow and
instability. Activity will mainly focus along a wavy cold front
that may tend to stall later in the period as upper troughing
settles over the West. This could lead to a pattern with enhanced
training.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and then expand into the Great Lakes through the
first part of next week with readings generally 10 to more than
25F above normal. Daily records should be more numerous for warm
lows than daytime highs.  Development and gradual progression of
the Plains/Midwest system and trailing front Tuesday onward will
slowly push this warmth more across the eastern half of the
country mid-late next week. Morning lows should remain as warm as
15-25F above normal and approach some record values while high
temperature anomalies should be less extreme. Meanwhile, the West
will experience a decent cooling trend spreading across the region
from west to east during the period with highs tending to drop to
5-10F or so below normal.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 PM CST Fri Mar 05 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

Latest guidance consensus continues to indicate dry and breezy
southerly flow prevailing across the central into northern High
Plains tomorrow (Saturday) afternoon. High-resolution/ensemble
guidance also depicts more widespread elevated conditions (15-20 mph
sustained southerly winds overlapping 15-25% RH) extending up into
northeast Wyoming/western South Dakota and southward to southeast
Colorado, hence the Elevated delineation expansion. Fuels appear to
be at least marginally receptive to fire-spread throughout most of
the High Plains. While some precipitation has recently accumulated
across portions of eastern Colorado into western Kansas, heavier
accumulations appear to have been localized, with fuel impacts
expected to be modest, particularly for 100 and 1000 hour fuels. A
couple instances of brief Critical conditions also cannot be
completely ruled out, particularly in eastern Colorado into western
Nebraska. Otherwise, brief and locally Elevated fire conditions may
occur anywhere across the High Plains, from northeast New Mexico to
eastern Montana. Conditions will continue to be monitored for the
possibility of additional fire weather highlight expansions.

..Squitieri.. 03/05/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0155 AM CST Fri Mar 05 2021/

...Synopsis...
Elevated fire weather concerns are expected on Saturday as winds
increase over portions of the High Plains (where conditions have
largely been dry in recent days). Elsewhere, locally elevated fire
weather conditions are possible, but limited fuel receptiveness and
cool weather will mitigate any additional fire weather concerns.

...central High Plains...
An upper-level shortwave trough transversing the central/northern
Rockies will support surface pressure falls across eastern
MT/northern WY on Saturday. In response, southerly winds are
expected to increase to 15-20 mph along the High Plains. A deep,
well-mixed boundary layer featuring a unidirectional wind profile
should allow for efficient downward momentum transfer of 20-30 mph
mid-level winds by late afternoon.

With a dry air mass already in place after Thursday's cold frontal
passage, relative humidity values will likely fall to near 20%
across a broad region from eastern CO to northeast WY/western SD
(though there is some uncertainty in the northern extent of the dry
air mass). Elevated conditions appear likely across this area, but
the fire weather concern will mainly be limited to western NE and
adjacent regions where limited precipitation has fallen over the
past few days and 10-hour fuel moisture values are in the 5-10%
range.

...Great Basin...
Surface pressure falls to the northeast with slow ridging to the
west will result in a modest surface pressure gradient over the
Great Basin for Saturday afternoon. Winds are forecast to increase
into the 15 to 20 mph range with relative humidity in the upper
teens and low 20s - especially for locations that typically see
downslope warming/drying under southwesterly flow regimes. Areas of
elevated conditions appear most likely across southeast NV into
southwest UT, but fuels remain largely unreceptive and will limit
the fire weather concern.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Fri March 05 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 11 - 15 2021

Today's model forecasts are in good agreement regarding the 500-hPa
circulation
pattern across most of North America during the 6-10 day period. The ensemb=
le
mean solutions from the GEFS, Canadian, and ECMWF model suites depict an
amplified mean trough and associated negative 500-hPa height anomalies over
eastern Siberia with associated below normal heights extending eastward to
northern Alaska. Farther to the south, anomalous ridging is forecast over t=
he
North Pacific, leading to anticipated above normal heights across the
Aleutians. Over the CONUS, a southern stream trough is predicted across the
Southwest, resulting in anticipated below normal heights extending from the
southwestern CONUS northeastward to the Northern High Plains. Ridging and
above
normal heights are expected east of the Mississippi and extending
southwestward
across much of the Southern Plains.

Enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures in the western CONUS ar=
e
associated with mean cyclonic flow and near to below normal mid-level heigh=
ts.
Conversely, amplified ridging favors enhanced probabilities of above normal
temperatures across the eastern CONUS and most of the Southern Plains. Belo=
w
normal temperatures are favored for southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, where both raw and calibrated dynamical model guidance from toda=
y's
ensemble means depict a cold signal near the end of next week into the
weekend.

Enhanced flow from the Bering Sea is anticipated across much of Alaska,
favoring above normal precipitation for most of the state. Conversely, odds
tilt toward below normal precipitation for much of the northwestern CONUS,
associated with forecast ridging over western Canada. Mean troughing center=
ed
over the Southwestern CONUS increases probabilities of above normal
precipitation from Southern California, eastward to the Central and Souther=
n
Rockies. Ahead of this trough, elevated above normal precipitation
probabilities are indicated for much of the Great Plains, Mississippi and O=
hio
valleys, Great Lakes, and Northeast. The potential for enhanced moisture
advection from the Gulf of Mexico increases the likelihood of above normal
precipitation across much of the east-central CONUS. Conversely, ridging
anticipated across the southeastern CONUS favors drier than normal conditio=
ns
across much of the Southeast.

Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 25% of Today's 0z Canad=
ian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
fairly good model agreement on an amplified pattern across much of North
America.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR MAR 13 - 19 2021

During the week-2 period, a transitional period is likely as the overall
pattern is forecast to de-amplify and model spread and uncertainty increase=
.
The most anomalous features predicted by the models across the Northern
Hemisphere include a ridge over the North Pacific, a closed mid-level low
north
of Siberia, and troughing extending from eastern Canada to southeast of
Greenland. Teleconnections from these features were relied upon to resolve
model differences across much of North America. The week-2 official 500-hPa
height blend, composed of roughly an even split of the GEFS, Canadian, and
ECMWF ensemble means, depicts persistent below normal heights across the
western CONUS, but with relatively low amplitude. Weak cyclonic flow is
forecast near the Great Lakes, and ridging is anticipated farther to the so=
uth
across the Southeast and Gulf Coast. Above normal heights are anticipated
across much of southern Alaska, in association with the predicted North
Pacific
Ridge. Near to below normal heights are likely for the remainder of the sta=
te,
associated with the trough forecast north of Siberia.

Persistent negative height anomalies anticipated over the western CONUS fav=
or
enhanced probabilities of below normal temperatures from the West Coast to
parts of the Great Plains. Conversely, ridging enhances odds of above norma=
l
temperatures across the Southeast and Gulf Coast. Below normal temperatures
are
favored for parts of southeastern Alaska, consistent with a cold signal
forecast by the GEFS Ensemble Mean early in the week-2 period. Near to abov=
e
normal temperatures are favored for the remainder of the state, ahead of a
mean
trough forecast over eastern Siberia.

Above normal precipitation is favored from parts of the Central and Souther=
n
Plains, northeastward across the Tennessee and Ohio valleys, eastern Great
Lakes, and parts of the Mid Atlantic and Northeast, underneath predicted
weakly
cyclonic flow. Below normal precipitation is favored farther to the south
across the Florida Peninsula, underneath predicted ridging and associated
above
normal heights. Predicted weakly enhanced Pacific flow slightly favors abov=
e
normal precipitation across parts of the West Coast. Conversely, weak ridgi=
ng
and associated surface high pressure lead to a slight tilt toward drier tha=
n
normal conditions for much of the interior West. Below normal precipitation=
 is
also favored for parts of the Northern Plains, associated with predicted me=
an
surface high pressure. Above normal precipitation is likely for much of
Alaska,
consistent with statistical guidance derived for the manual 500-hPa height
blend.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 35% of Today's 6z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 30% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered o=
n
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
a predicted transitional pattern across much of the forecast domain.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
March 18.

...Rain and mountain snow in the West Coast through this weekend...

...Elevated fire weather conditions over portions of the High
Plains Saturday...

...Lake effect snow downwind from the Lower Great Lakes on Friday
night into Sunday...

Wet conditions will prevail along the West Coast through this
weekend as a frontal system just off the coast begins to move
inland by tonight, and then into the Intermountain West by
Saturday morning. Additional moderate mountain snow will develop
with the passage of the system, with 4-6 inches possible in
portions of the Sierra Nevada and further north into the Shasta
and Cascade ranges. Accordingly, Winter Storm Advisories are in
effect for portions of Northern California. Otherwise, the soaking
rain in lower elevations will provide some relief for drought
stricken areas along the coast. After a brief reprieve in the wake
of this system another shot of rain and mountain snow is forecast
to move into the Northwest as another frontal system enters on the
heels of the first by Sunday Morning.

As the aforementioned frontal boundary traverses the Rockies
tomorrow morning, warm and breezy conditions will develop ahead of
it, leading to an enhanced fire weather risk over portions of the
High Plains through tomorrow. The Storm Prediction Center has
highlighted an Elevated Risk of fire weather east of the Front
Range in Colorado and further north into Wyoming, Nebraska, and
South Dakota, with Fire Weather Watches in effect for those areas.

Low pressure over the Southern Plains will slowly move
southeastward to the Gulf of Mexico by Friday night.  The system
will produce rain and thunderstorms over parts of the Southern
Plains that will move into the Central Gulf Coast by Saturday
morning. There is a chance some of these storms may be severe; the
Storm Prediction Center has issued a Marginal Risk of severe
thunderstorms over portions of South Texas into Louisiana for
severe wind and hail through tomorrow. As the system slowly
migrates into the Gulf of Mexico, rain will linger over parts of
the Southeast through Sunday.

Meanwhile, a deep upper-level low over Southeastern Canada will
steer upper-level energy over the Lower Great Lakes through
Sunday. The cold air will flow over the Lower Great Lakes,
producing lake effect snow downwind from Lake Erie and Ontario
late Friday into Sunday morning, where 4-6 inches of snow is
possible. In addition to lake effect snow, the Green Mountains and
Adirondacks may pick up a quick 2-3 inches as the system swings
through.

...Overview and Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to offer a strong signal that an amplified
eastern Pacific mean trough aloft will settle over the West next
week in a pattern with above normal forecast predictability
overall. This trough will support rain and higher elevation snow
along with the advent of below normal temperatures. Meanwhile by
Tuesday-Wednesday, a main shortwave forecast to eject from the
trough will support a Plains low pressure system to spread a broad
area of precipitation across the central/east-central U.S.. Ahead
of this evolution, eastern U.S. heights will tend to rise for much
of the coming week as ridging moves in from the central U.S. and
an upper high builds up from the Gulf. This will bring much above
normal temperatures from the north-central U.S. to the East.

Accordingly, the WPC medium range product suite was derived from a
composite of the 12 UTC GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF ensemble mean
along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models days 3-6
(Tuesday-Friday). 12 UTC GFS/GEFS solutions cluster slightly
better with the 12 UTC ECMWF/ECENS mean than the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS.
Opted to focus on mainly the ensemble means by day 7/next Saturday
to account for increasing forecast uncertainty and recent run to
run model continuity issues at longer time frames, especially with
upper trough specifics out from the Southwest. WPC continuity is
well maintained with this forecast strategy.


...Weather/Threats Highlights...

Expect rain/higher elevation snow as an upper trough/low settles
into the West/Southwest in separated southern stream flow. Heavier
precipitation will focus over favored terrain in California, with
highest amounts most likely for the Sierra Nevada and coastal
ranges. Some meaningful precipitation will also spread across the
Interior West and the Rockies with upper trough, ejecting impulses
and frontal system progressions. Energies ejecting into the Plains
will support frontal low pressure systems with a precipitation
focusing into the south-central Plains, Mid-Mississippi Valley,
and Midwest/Great Lakes/Ohio Valley with Gulf moisture pooling.
Some wintry weather may be possible over extreme northern
locations. Activity will focus near a wavy cold front that may
tend to stall as upper troughing settles over the West, leading to
some training.

Much above normal temperatures will persist over the northern
Plains/Midwest and then expand into the Great Lakes through the
first part of next week with readings generally 10 to more than
25F above normal. Daily records should be more numerous for warm
lows than daytime highs. Development and gradual progression of
the Plains/Midwest system and trailing front Tuesday onward will
slowly push this warmth more across the eastern half of the
country mid-late next week. Morning lows should remain as warm as
15-25F above normal and approach some record values while high
temperature anomalies should be less extreme. Meanwhile, the West
will experience a decent cooling trend spreading across the region
from west to east during the period with highs tending to drop to
5-10F or so below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0100 AM CST Sat Mar 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, noted in morning water-vapor
imagery moving onshore across northern California, will continue to
progress to the northeast into the northern Rockies by this
afternoon. In response, a deepening lee trough will strengthen
pressure-gradient winds and support elevated fire weather conditions
across the Plains as well as the Great Basin. Elsewhere across the
CONUS, rain chances across the Southeast and weak winds over
southwestern TX will limit additional fire weather concerns.

...High Plains...
The overall forecast remains on track and confidence in widespread
elevated fire weather conditions from eastern CO northward into
western SD is high based on recent observations. Regional 00 UTC
soundings and recent surface observations reveal a dry boundary
layer already in place, which will help relative humidity values
fall into the 15-20% range later today. Sustained winds near 20 mph
are expected, and steepening low-level lapse rates will help
downward mixing of 30-35 mph gusts by late afternoon.

Recent hi-res ensemble guidance continues to show high probabilities
in elevated conditions, and suggests that sustained winds near 20
mph and RH values between 20-25% may extend as far north as western
ND/eastern MT (though slightly higher boundary-layer moisture is
noted in the 00 UTC BIS sounding). Transient critical conditions are
possible across northeast CO and western NE where the potential for
RH near 15% and frequent gusts to 30 mph is highest. Confidence in
sustained, widespread critical conditions is currently not high
enough to warrant a delineation, though trends will continue to be
monitored.

...Great Basin...
Lee troughing to across MT/WY with gradual surface pressure rises
across CA will help strengthen the pressure gradient across the
Great Basin this afternoon. Winds increasing to 15-20 mph are likely
and may coincide with areas of 15-20% RH - especially across
southeast UT where the overlap of favorable wind/RH is highest per
recent guidance. However, ERC values across this region remain below
critical thresholds, suggesting a muted fire weather concern.

...Rain and thunderstorms over parts of the Southeast through
Sunday, while rain and mountain snow develop over parts the
Northwest and parts of California through Monday...

...Elevated fire weather conditions over portions of the High
Plains on Saturday...

...Lake effect snow downwind from the Lower Great Lakes on
Saturday into Sunday evening...

A front over the Southeast into the Gulf of Mexico will move
southeastward across the Florida Peninsula by Sunday morning.

The system will produce rain and thunderstorms over parts of the
Central Gulf Coast into parts of Florida on Saturday.  The rain
and thunderstorms will move southward over the Florida Peninsula
through Sunday morning.

Meanwhile, a deep upper-level low over Southeastern Canada will
steer upper-level energy over the Lower Great Lakes through
Sunday. The cold air will flow over the Lower Great Lakes,
producing lake effect snow downwind from Lake Erie and Ontario
late Friday into Sunday evening.  Light snow will also develop
over the Green Mountains and Adirondacks through Sunday morning.

A front over the Northern Intermountain Region southward to
Southern California will move eastward to the Upper Great Lakes
while stretching westward to the Great Basin by Monday.  A second
front will move to the West Coast and dissipate by Sunday
afternoon.  The systems will produce rain and higher elevation
snow over parts of the Pacific Northwest into Northern/Central
California on Saturday morning.  The precipitation ends over
California by late Saturday afternoon.   The snow will move into
the Northern Rockies also by Saturday evening.  The rain and snow
will end over most of the Northwest by late Sunday night.

As the first front crosses the Rockies Saturday morning, warm and
breezy conditions will develop ahead of it, leading to an enhanced
fire weather risk over portions of the High Plains through
Saturday. The Storm Prediction Center has highlighted an Elevated
Risk of fire weather east of the Front Range in Colorado and
farther north into Wyoming, Nebraska, and South Dakota, with Red
Flag Warnings in effect for those areas.

0150 AM CST Sat Mar 06 2021

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Localized fire weather concerns are possible for Sunday afternoon as
winds increase across portions of the southern Plains and Great
Basin. Elsewhere, a building surface high over the eastern third of
the CONUS will yield generally weak winds and low fire weather
potential.

...Eastern Kansas into northern Missouri...
Saturday's lee trough/surface low over the northern Rockies is
forecast to continue translating to the east/northeast into central
Canada in tandem with a de-amplifying upper-level wave. A trailing,
weak surface trough should linger across the Plains on Sunday
afternoon. To the east, surface high pressure will build in the wake
of a departing upper-level wave off the East Coast. The
juxtaposition of these two features should favor strengthening
boundary-layer winds across OK, eastern KS, and western MO. Minimal
moisture return into the region combined with slightly above-normal
temperatures could yield RH reductions in the 20-35% range, though
confidence is low due to high model spread. However, recent reports
from eastern KS suggest that fine fuels are receptive and can
support fire spread. As such, the fire weather threat will be
conditional on the degree of RH reduction across eastern KS/western
MO. Trends will continue to be monitored and a risk area may be
introduced if confidence in the RH forecast improves.

...Great Basin...
A broad upper-level trough will begin approaching the West Coast
through the day Sunday. This feature will bring precipitation
chances to the Northwest as well as modest surface pressure falls
across the Great Basin. Surface winds will likely increase to 15-20
mph in response and support areas of elevated fire weather
conditions where conditions are dry. Northwestern AZ into central NV
and southwest UT should see the highest potential for elevated
conditions, but fuel status remains questionable across this region.

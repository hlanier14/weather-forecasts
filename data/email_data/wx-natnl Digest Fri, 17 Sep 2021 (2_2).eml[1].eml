...EXTREMELY CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN GREAT BASIN
INTO THE NORTHERN ROCKIES...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level pattern is expected to undergo slight amplification
over the next 24-48 hours as an upper-level trough deepens over the
Pacific Northwest/West Coast. This will result in strengthening
southwesterly flow from the northern Sierra into the northern
Rockies, which will support increasing probabilities for elevated to
critical fire weather conditions. This pattern will also introduce
increasing rain chances for parts of the Pacific Northwest, Utah,
and southwest Wyoming, reducing the fire weather potential for these
regions.

...Northern Great Basin to Northern Rockies...
A belt of stronger mid to upper-level flow will become established
from northwest NV, through ID, and into southern MT and adjacent
areas of the northern High Plains. A deepening surface low over the
Canadian prairies will feature a trailing surface trough into the
northern Rockies, which will help induce breezy southwesterly flow
near the surface. The combination of a uni-directional wind profile,
diurnal boundary-layer mixing, and strong flow aloft will support
sustained winds between 15-25 mph with gusts upwards up 25-35 mph
(possibly up to 40-45 mph within the critical risk area). Although
receptive fuels are already in place for many locations,
hot/dry/windy conditions Friday will aid in further curing by
Saturday. A dry air mass already in place over the inter-mountain
West, coupled with downslope drying, will support RH values in the
low teens to low 20s. As such, widespread elevated conditions seem
likely with a belt of critical conditions probable under the axis of
stronger mid-level flow. Critical conditions are possible across
northeast WY within a downslope wind regime, but may be more
localized in nature.

...Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas will continue to bring a threat
of locally heavy rain and flash flooding to portions of the Gulf
Coast states over the next couple of days...

...A strong cold front and accompanying plume of deep moisture
will bring windy conditions and heavy rains to the Northwest
beginning Friday...

...Very warm, windy, and dry conditions will support widespread
elevated fire weather conditions from the Great Basin to the
northern High Plains Friday and Saturday...

Post-Tropical Cyclone Nicholas will continue to slowly drift north
and weaken over the lower Mississippi Valley over the next couple
of days.  The system is expected to produce additional periods of
heavy rain along the central Gulf Coast into portions of the lower
Mississippi Valley and the Southeast.  Flash flooding impacts,
especially in urban areas, are possible across these areas.  Even
as the system dissipates, ample moisture will remain in place --
supporting showers and thunderstorms across the region through the
weekend.

Wet weather is also likely for portions of the Northwest as a
strong cold front and an accompanying plume of deep moisture
slides into the region on Friday.  Windy conditions are expected
across western Washington as the system moves into the region,
with heavy rain beginning to develop by late Friday and continuing
into early Saturday. The front will continue to push farther south
and east on Saturday, with heavy rain spreading south into western
Oregon.  Lighter amounts are expected farther east into the
northern Rockies.  Even with the front pushing well east of the
region, unsettled weather will continue across the Northwest
through the weekend, with even an isolated thunderstorm possible
across western Washington and Oregon Saturday and Sunday.  Storm
total amounts of 2-4 inches, with locally heavier amounts, are
expected across western Washington and Oregon, with the heaviest
totals likely along the Olympic Peninsula, coastal ranges, and the
Cascades.

Ahead of the system, windy, dry conditions and above-normal
temperatures are expected to support widespread elevated fire
weather concerns across portions of the Great Basin, northern
Sierra, and the northern Rockies and High Plains on Friday and
Saturday -- with Red Flag Warnings in effect for much of the
region.  Temperatures are expected to surge well into the 90s --
more than 20 degrees above normal -- across portions of the
northern High Plains on Saturday.

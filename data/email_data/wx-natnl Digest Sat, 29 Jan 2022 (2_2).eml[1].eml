Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0117 AM CST Sat Jan 29 2022

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Predominantly northwesterly mid-level flow will persist across the
central U.S as an upper trough ejects into the Atlantic today. A 500
mb impulse embedded in the broader northwesterly mid-level flow will
overspread the central Plains during the afternoon hours. As a
result, a large enough span of overlapping 15 mph sustained
northwesterly surface winds and 15-20 percent RH will develop by
afternoon peak heating, warranting the maintenance of Elevated
highlights despite cooler surface temperatures. Farther south across
western Texas into central Oklahoma, 15-20 percent RH is expected
due to broad lee troughing supporting the eastward push of dry air
from the southern High Plains. Nonetheless, surface winds are
expected to remain below 15 mph on a widespread basis per latest
guidance consensus, precluding the introduction of Elevated
highlights this outlook. Should any increase in surface winds become
evident in later guidance, Elevated highlights may need to be added
in the 17Z update.

Dry and breezy northwesterly surface flow is expected across the
Florida Peninsula, behind the surface cold front. However, fuels
across the area remain poorly receptive to fire spread, hence the
withholding of fire weather highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 AM CST Sat Jan 29 2022

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly flow aloft will prevail across the CONUS as
multiple embedded mid-level troughs progress eastward from the
Interior West to the East Coast tomorrow/Sunday. A 500 mb open wave
will begin to close while traversing Texas. Given the progressive
upper pattern, sustained but weak surface lee troughing is expected
across the Plains states, with dry surface air (15-25 percent RH)
expected to meander around the central and southern High Plains
during the afternoon. However, guidance consensus suggests that
widespread 15+ mph sustained wind speeds will be lacking, with
Elevated conditions expected to remain localized, precluding fire
weather highlights this outlook.

...Powerful winter storm to produce significant impacts across
parts of New England and coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on
Saturday...

...Below-average temperatures will expand across the eastern third
of the country this weekend before moderating next week; Great
Plains and Mississippi Valley warm up into next week...

...New system to bring rain and heavy snow to the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies beginning Sunday.

An area of low pressure, currently off the Carolina coast, will
rapidly intensify today as it makes its way up the eastern
seaboard. Heavy snow and powerful winds will spread from the
Mid-Atlantic coast to the Northeast coast throughout the day. The
combination of heavy snow rates and strong winds will produce
dangerous blizzard conditions across portions of the Mid-Atlantic
and New England coasts, from Virginia's Eastern Shore to eastern
Maine, where Blizzard Warnings are in effect. Travel in these
areas will be nearly impossible today due to whiteout conditions.
Total snowfall accumulations greater than 12" are expected along
much of the Northeast coast with local maxima greater than 24"
across eastern Massachusetts including the Boston metro area.
Winter Storm Watches and Warnings are also in effect from the
coasts farther inland where accumulating snowfall is also likely.
Strong damaging winds will lead to scattered power outages. Very
cold temperatures will spread across the eastern third of the
country on the backside of the departing Nor'easter. This may
exacerbate an already dangerous situation for those without
energy/heat. The snow and wind will come to an end across northern
Maine on Sunday.


Elsewhere, Freeze Watches and Warnings are in effect for much of
the Florida Peninsula for tonight. Much of the state will remain
mostly clear and frigid tonight with a chance of scattered to
isolated falling iguanas due to the subfreezing temperatures. Much
of the Great Plains and Mississippi Valley will warm up through
the beginning of the work week. Upstream from the Nor'easter, an
upper-level impulse will generate windy surface conditions across
the Central Plains today. That paired with relatively dry air will
lead to an elevated Fire Weather threat for today. An emerging low
pressure system will bring rain and heavy snow to the Pacific
Northwest and Northern Rockies on Sunday and continuing across the
Northern Rockies into Monday. Another shortwave impulse may
generate scattered thunderstorms across southern Texas and the
western Gulf coast on Sunday

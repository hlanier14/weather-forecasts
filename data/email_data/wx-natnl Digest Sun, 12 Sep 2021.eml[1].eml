Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Sat Sep 11 2021

Valid 111700Z - 121200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Southern/Central Plains: Wind/RH...
Surface observations from 11 AM CDT at several stations across the
southern Plains (e.g., KGUY, KPYX, KDUX) suggest elevated to
critical meteorological conditions are already ongoing in some
areas. Meteorological fire weather conditions should continue to
intensify through the afternoon as RH values continue to decrease,
with critical meteorological fire weather conditions likely for
several hours across portions of western Oklahoma, the
Texas/Oklahoma Panhandles, and southwest Kansas. As mentioned in the
previous forecast discussion, fuels across the region are not quite
to critical thresholds, which precludes a Critical fire weather
area. Though, locally critical conditions are likely especially
across portions of northwest Oklahoma, the eastern Oklahoma
Panhandle, the northeast Texas Panhandle where the best overlap of
strong winds, lowered RH, and at least modestly receptive fuels is
expected. Overall, only minor adjustments were made to the Elevated
forecast area based on the latest weather and fuel guidance.

...Southwest Wyoming/Northeast Utah...
Near-severe erratic/gusty outflow winds may occur nearby the
strongest thunderstorms across portions of southwest Wyoming and
vicinity, where a Marginal Risk for severe thunderstorms in the Day
1 SPC Convective Outlooks overlaps the Day 1 SPC Isolated Dry
Thunderstorm area.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
today's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1144 PM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the northern Rockies
today and deamplify as it moves into the northern Plains. At the
surface, a low pressure center is forecast to deepen to around
1006mb as it moves south into northwest Kansas. As the pressure
gradient tightens in the vicinity of the surface low, dry and breezy
conditions are expected across the Texas Panhandle into portions of
western Oklahoma and southwest Kansas. Winds are forecast around 20
to 25 mph with relative humidity around 12 to 18 percent. Fuels in
this area are starting to dry out with ERCs around the 80th
percentile. If fuels were more dry, a critical delineation would be
appropriate, but given the fuels which are not quite to critical
thresholds, an elevated delineation should appropriately cover the
fire weather threat.

Additionally, dry and breezy conditions are forecast on the
northwest side of the surface low in the wake of the surface cold
front. Cooler air advecting into the region will keep relative
humidity higher across much of the region, but in southeast Wyoming
and into the Nebraska Panhandle, temperatures are still forecast to
be high enough in the immediate wake of the cold front for sub 20
percent relative humidity. Therefore, a small elevated area is
warranted across this region.

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are forecast across much of the
Rockies and into portions of the eastern Great Basin. PWAT values
around 0.75 to 1 inch and moderate storm motions should support a
combination of both wet and dry storms. There is a region from
southeast Idaho, across far northeast Utah, much of southern
Wyoming, and northern Colorado where critically dry fuels are
present based on latest fuel guidance. Therefore, there may be some
threat of new lightning induced fire starts in this region from the
mix of wet and dry thunderstorm activity, especially outside of main
precipitation cores.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0135 PM CDT Sat Sep 11 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

Tomorrow's fire weather forecast of Elevated fire weather conditions
across portions of the southern Plains remains on track, with only
minor adjustments needed to account for the latest weather and fuel
guidance.

Please see the previous discussion below for more information on
tomorrow's fire weather forecast.

..Elliott.. 09/11/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1144 PM CDT Fri Sep 10 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, a surface low is forecast to continue to drift south
across Kansas. Gusty surface winds are forecast near this surface
low, especially across the TX Panhandle into western Oklahoma and
southwest Kansas. In this area, winds are forecast to be around 15
to 20 mph with relative humidity around 15 to 20 percent. Presently,
ERCs are only around the 80th percentile, but dry and breezy
conditions on Saturday should continue to dry fuels. Therefore,
fuels should be even more dry by Sunday. Even though fuels are not
expected to be critically dry, they are forecast to be close, and
with near critical meteorological conditions forecast, an elevated
delineation is warranted.

...Heavy Rain Likely Across Coastal Texas and Louisiana into the
middle of next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Expect the heaviest concentration of rainfall during the period to
be along parts of the western/central Gulf Coast into midweek.
There is still a lot of uncertainty regarding how a wave emerging
into the southwestern Gulf of Mexico may ultimately evolve and
track farther north, tempering confidence in the details of how
much moisture will reach the Gulf Coast region and where. Continue
to monitor National Hurricane Center outlooks for the latest
information on this feature. Meanwhile progressive flow across the
northern tier of the U.S. will push along multiple frontal systems
with varying amounts of accompanying rainfall. By the time the
fronts reach the East, mean ridging or at least above normal
heights aloft will make it difficult for the fronts to reach any
farther south than the Lower Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and northern
Mid-Atlantic--yielding above average temperatures over a decent
portion of the eastern U.S. Around the periphery of strongest
Atlantic upper ridging, a wave/system may track near the Bahamas
and East Coast. In contrast to the eastern warmth, a deepening
upper trough forecast to reach the Northwest by next Saturday
should bring an early taste of a cool-season pattern with below
normal temperatures and wetter conditions that may include some
high elevation snow.

For the large-scale pattern and associated features, a composite
of 00Z models/06Z GFS provided a reasonable starting point for
about the first half of the period while a steady trend toward
about half models and half means (06Z GEFS/00Z ECens) accounted
for the moderate increase of detail spread that develops later in
the period. The primary change in continuity results from the
latest consensus being stronger/faster with the upper trough that
reaches the northern Rockies/Plains by Thursday, ultimately
leading to greater southeastward progression of the leading cold
front during the latter half of the week. Ensemble means supported
the majority scenario while the old 12Z/10 ECMWF was quite slow
even versus its mean. The 12Z GFS has backed off from this trend
somewhat but the new ECMWF is consistent. Issues with this trough
ultimately extend into the East late in the period and could
affect the progression of the surface wave/energy aloft that may
track near the Mid-Atlantic coast. A favored intermediate approach
would lead to somewhat higher heights aloft/slower progression
than in the 00Z ECMWF. Guidance seems to be navigating toward an
intermediate solution for the Northwest upper trough by next
Saturday, as the 00Z ECMWF lowered heights versus its prior run
while the latest GFS runs have backed away some from the
relatively deeper 00Z run. This trough may contain multiple pieces
of energy so details may remain ambiguous for a while.

Confidence remains low for the details of possible tropical
development in the western Gulf of Mexico late this weekend and
the resulting heavy rainfall threat along the Texas/Louisiana
coasts through at least the middle of next week. Most of the
guidance agrees upon a general heavy rainfall threat associated
with moist flow from the Gulf and surface troughing or low
pressure. The degree and track of any well-defined surface system
will be crucial in determining the magnitude and location/duration
of heaviest rainfall though, and unfortunately surface details
could depend on exactly how convection organizes well into the
short-range time frame. Current preferences (including from
today's 17Z coordination with the National Hurricane Center) lean
more to recent GFS/ECMWF runs in general with greater
definition/northward track versus the CMC/UKMET that have been
much weaker and southwestward. Consult the National Hurricane
Center's Tropical Weather Outlook for latest details on the
development potential for this system.

...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect multiple rounds of heavy rainfall near the Texas coast and
into parts of Louisiana through the early/middle portions of next
week. Details will be very sensitive to the evolution/track of a
tropical disturbance now emerging into the southwestern Gulf. A
well-defined/northward system could bring up to 10-15 inch
localized totals but potential also exists for a weaker and
farther southwest feature that would lead to rainfall that is less
extreme/focused. Even in this latter case the general pattern
could still favor areas of sufficiently heavy rainfall to be
hazardous. The forecast requires close monitoring given the
potential for some flash and urban flooding, particularly for more
sensitive locations... urban regions and those areas that have
already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

Mostly lighter rainfall will accompany frontal passages through
the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS. Some potential
exists for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts,
especially from the Midwest into far interior New England with a
leading front Tuesday-Wednesday. Moderate to locally heavy
rainfall may also reach the Pacific Northwest late this week with
some snow possible in the highest elevations of the Washington
Cascades. Some locations along the East Coast may see rainfall
with a wave that could track close to the Mid-Atlantic by late
this week.

The most persistent warm anomalies should be over portions of the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast with some
readings 10-15F or so above normal over multiple days. In general
morning lows should be somewhat more above normal than daytime
highs. Surrounding areas may see more brief episodes of warmth
depending on frontal progression. The possible system near the
Mid-Atlantic late in the week would decrease high temperatures
somewhat. More moderate warm anomalies (plus 5-10F) should extend
back through the southern half of the West while clouds and
tropical moisture will keep western-central Gulf Coast highs
somewhat below normal. By the end of the week highs in the
Northwest should decrease to as much as 10-15F below normal as the
upper trough reaches the area. Downstream the amplifying pattern
could increase coverage of highs 10-15F above normal over the
Plains for next Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat September 11 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...Developing tropical activity over the Bay of Campeche expected
to produce heavy rainfall and concerns for flash flooding by late
Sunday and through the early to middle part of next week for the
western Gulf Coast including coastal areas of Texas and
Louisiana...

...Hot temperatures expected to continue from the Southwest to the
Midwest while expanding gradually east into the Mid-Atlantic...

...Severe weather possible for portions of the central and
northern Plains east to the Great Lakes region...

An area of disturbed weather over the Bay of Campeche has a high
likelihood of developing into a a tropical depression on Sunday or
Monday as the system moves northwestward and then northward near
the coast of northeastern Mexico. A surge of tropical moisture
associated with this along with a surface trough extending north
across the western Gulf of Mexico is expected to allow for heavy
showers and thunderstorms to begin arriving across coastal areas
of Texas and Louisiana by late Sunday and this activity will
spread gradually farther inland across the western Gulf Coast
region through the early to middle part of next week. In time,
locally significant rainfall totals will be possible, potentially
resulting in areas of flash and urban flooding. The Weather
Prediction Center has indicated a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall for portions of Texas and Louisiana to address these
concerns, and interests along the western and northwestern Gulf
Coast should monitor the progress of this system currently over
the Bay of Campeche. Please consult the latest National Hurricane
Center Tropical Weather Outlook for more information.

Elsewhere, an expansive dome of upper-level high pressure
stretching across the southern two-thirds of the U.S. mainland
will continue to drive locally very hot temperatures, with the
heat encompassing a broad area from the Southwest to the Midwest,
and with the heat expected to advance east into the Mid-Atlantic
region by the start of the new week. Temperatures will locally be
as much as 15 to 20 degrees above normal, with some of the
greatest concentration of this expected to be over the central
Plains. Record high temps will be challenged locally across the
region with some temperatures exceeding the century mark in spots.
In fact, Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued in parts of
Arizona and the Lower Colorado River Valley for both Sunday and
Monday. Generally the coolest temperatures will be confined to the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Plains in the wake of a cold
front that will be crossing the region.

The cold front crossing the Pacific Northwest and northern Plains
will be associated with an upper-level trough, and this energy is
expected to gradually break down the aforementioned ridge of high
pressure over of the southern two-thirds of the nation. As this
occurs, a frontal zone with multiple waves of low pressure
advancing along it will be the focus of scattered to broken areas
of heavy showers and thunderstorms. This will impact a broad area
from the central and northern Plains through the Midwest and into
the Great Lakes region. Some severe weather will be possible
locally, and the Storm Prediction Center does have a Slight Risk
of severe weather currently depicted for Sunday across southern
New York and far northern Pennsylvania. A Marginal Risk of severe
weather is highlighted across the central High Plains for both
Sunday and Monday, and in all of these cases, there will be a
threat for strong, damaging winds and some large hail.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat September 11 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
706 PM EDT Sat Sep 11 2021

Valid 00Z Sun Sep 12 2021 - 00Z Tue Sep 14 2021

...Developing tropical activity over the Bay of Campeche expected
to produce heavy rainfall and concerns for flash flooding by late
Sunday and through the early to middle part of next week for the
western Gulf Coast including coastal areas of Texas and
Louisiana...

...Hot temperatures expected to continue from the Southwest to the
Midwest while expanding gradually east into the Mid-Atlantic...

...Severe weather possible for portions of the central and
northern Plains east to the Great Lakes region...

An area of disturbed weather over the Bay of Campeche has a high
likelihood of developing into a tropical depression on Sunday or
Monday as the system moves northwestward and then northward near
the coast of northeastern Mexico. A surge of tropical moisture
associated with this along with a surface trough extending north
across the western Gulf of Mexico is expected to allow for heavy
showers and thunderstorms to begin arriving across coastal areas
of Texas and Louisiana by late Sunday and this activity will
spread gradually farther inland across the western Gulf Coast
region through the early to middle part of next week. In time,
locally significant rainfall totals will be possible, potentially
resulting in areas of flash and urban flooding. The Weather
Prediction Center has indicated a Slight Risk of excessive
rainfall for portions of Texas and Louisiana to address these
concerns, and interests along the western and northwestern Gulf
Coast should monitor the progress of this system currently over
the Bay of Campeche. Please consult the latest National Hurricane
Center Tropical Weather Outlook for more information.

Elsewhere, an expansive dome of upper-level high pressure
stretching across the southern two-thirds of the U.S. mainland
will continue to drive locally very hot temperatures, with the
heat encompassing a broad area from the Southwest to the Midwest,
and with the heat expected to advance east into the Mid-Atlantic
region by the start of the new week. Temperatures will locally be
as much as 15 to 20 degrees above normal, with some of the
greatest concentration of this expected to be over the central
Plains. Record high temps will be challenged locally across the
region with some temperatures exceeding the century mark in spots.
In fact, Excessive Heat Warnings have been issued in parts of
Arizona and the Lower Colorado River Valley for both Sunday and
Monday. Generally the coolest temperatures will be confined to the
Pacific Northwest and the northern Plains in the wake of a cold
front that will be crossing the region.

The cold front crossing the Pacific Northwest and northern Plains
will be associated with an upper-level trough, and this energy is
expected to gradually break down the aforementioned ridge of high
pressure over of the southern two-thirds of the nation. As this
occurs, a frontal zone with multiple waves of low pressure
advancing along it will be the focus of scattered to broken areas
of heavy showers and thunderstorms. This will impact a broad area
from the central and northern Plains through the Midwest and into
the Great Lakes region. Some severe weather will be possible
locally, and the Storm Prediction Center does have a Slight Risk
of severe weather currently depicted for Sunday across southern
New York and far northern Pennsylvania. A Marginal Risk of severe
weather is highlighted across the central High Plains for both
Sunday and Monday, and in all of these cases, there will be a
threat for strong, damaging winds and some large hail.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0113 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021

Valid 121200Z - 131200Z

...Synopsis...
Cyclogenesis is forecast in the central Plains today as a weak
mid-level shortwave trough crosses the Rockies. The surface pressure
gradient is expected to tighten during the afternoon which should
result in winds of 15 to 20 mph across much of Kansas and Oklahoma
into the Texas Panhandle. The dry Southwest airmass extends
northeastward across the Texas Panhandle into southwest Kansas. This
is the area where large fire concerns are greatest as relative
humidity will be 10 to 15 percent. Fuels are also drying
considerably with ERCs now above the 85th percentile.

A mix of both wet and dry thunderstorms may be possible across
northern Utah and southeast Idaho into western Wyoming, but there is
not enough overlap with dry fuels and storm confidence to include an
isolated dry thunderstorm area at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0118 AM CDT Sun Sep 12 2021

Valid 131200Z - 141200Z

...Synopsis...
On Monday, a gusty southerly flow is expected across the TX/OK
Panhandles into western Oklahoma and southwest Kansas as the
pressure gradient tightens across the southern Plains. Increasing
moisture is expected across much of Oklahoma, and therefore, the
drier surface airmass is expected to shift farther northwest. Winds
of 15 to 20 mph are forecast with relative humidity between 10 and
15 percent from the northern Texas Panhandle into southwest Kansas.

A mix of wet and dry thunderstorms may be possible across Colorado,
Wyoming, and eastern Utah on Monday. However, the driest storms are
expected to be where fuels are only marginally dry from recent
rainfall, and where Sunday rainfall may further improve fuel
conditions. Therefore, no isolated dry thunderstorm area is
warranted at this time.

...Heavy Rain Likely Across Coastal Texas and Louisiana into the
middle of next week...

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Main system of interest continues to be a tropical disturbance
emerging into the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend and
track north towards the western Gulf Coast by the start of the
medium range period on Wednesday. Although most of the guidance
now agrees on a heavy rainfall threat along the Texas coast and
into Louisiana, there remains quite a bit of uncertainty regarding
the evolution of this system and exactly how much moisture will
reach the Gulf Coast region and where. The GFS and ECMWF models
remain more defined and farther north, while the CMC/UKMET are
weaker and south. WPC prefers a blend towards the GFS/ECMWF which
is also more consistent with the previous forecast. Consult the
National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlook for the
latest details on the development potential with this system.

Meanwhile, progressive flow across the northern tier of the CONUS
will push along multiple frontal systems. There's good enough
agreement in the day 3-5 time frame for a general model
compromise, but details in timing and amplitude especially with
the next trough entering the Western U.S. late period emerge by
day 6/Saturday. The ECMWF and CMC get noticeably faster with the
trough axis which reaches the central U.S. by Sunday. The 18z GFS
is much slower keeping the axis over the west coast. Prefer a
blend towards the better agreeable ensemble means which kind of
splits the difference between the two camps.

The last system to note is an area of low pressure expected to
form east of the Bahamas and track towards the north, off the East
Coast. The GFS is the strongest with possible tropical development
of this system bringing the low very near/over the Mid-Atlantic
coast. The ECMWF and CMC are farther off shore. A shortwave moving
over the Great Lakes should help to eventually push the system
east shunting any progression farther into the Northeast. These
differences obviously have huge implications for any kind of
rainfall across an already over saturated coastal
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect multiple rounds of heavy rainfall near the Texas coast and
into parts of Louisiana through the middle of next week. Details
will be very sensitive to the evolution/track of a tropical
disturbance now emerging into the southwestern Gulf. A
well-defined/northward system could bring up to 10-15 inch
localized totals but potential also exists for a weaker and
farther southwest feature that would lead to rainfall that is less
extreme/focused. Even in this latter case the general pattern
could still favor areas of sufficiently heavy rainfall to be
hazardous. The forecast requires close monitoring given the
potential for some flash and urban flooding, particularly for more
sensitive locations... urban regions and those areas that have
already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

Mostly lighter rainfall will accompany frontal passages through
the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS. Some potential
exists for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts,
especially from the Midwest into far interior New England with a
leading front Tuesday-Wednesday. Moderate to locally heavy
rainfall may also reach the Pacific Northwest late this week with
some snow possible in the highest elevations of the Washington
Cascades. Some locations along the East Coast may see rainfall
with a wave that could track close to the Mid-Atlantic by late
this week.

The most persistent warm anomalies should be over portions of the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast with some
readings 10-15F or so above normal over multiple days. In general
morning lows should be somewhat more above normal than daytime
highs. Surrounding areas may see more brief episodes of warmth
depending on frontal progression. The possible system near the
Mid-Atlantic late in the week would decrease high temperatures
somewhat. More moderate warm anomalies (plus 5-10F) should extend
back through the southern half of the West while clouds and
tropical moisture will keep western-central Gulf Coast highs
somewhat below normal. By the end of the week highs in the
Northwest should decrease to as much as 10-15F below normal as the
upper trough reaches the area. Downstream the amplifying pattern
could increase coverage of highs 10-15F above normal over the
Plains for next Saturday and into the upper midwest on Sunday.

Main system of interest continues to be a tropical disturbance
emerging into the southwestern Gulf of Mexico this weekend and
track north towards the western Gulf Coast by the start of the
medium range period on Wednesday. Although most of the guidance
now agrees on a heavy rainfall threat along the Texas coast and
into Louisiana, there remains quite a bit of uncertainty regarding
the evolution of this system and exactly how much moisture will
reach the Gulf Coast region and where. The GFS and ECMWF models
remain more defined and farther north, while the CMC/UKMET are
weaker and south. WPC prefers a blend towards the GFS/ECMWF which
is also more consistent with the previous forecast. Consult the
National Hurricane Center's Tropical Weather Outlook for the
latest details on the development potential with this system.

Meanwhile, progressive flow across the northern tier of the CONUS
will push along multiple frontal systems. There's good enough
agreement in the day 3-5 time frame for a general model
compromise, but details in timing and amplitude especially with
the next trough entering the Western U.S. late period emerge by
day 6/Saturday. The ECMWF and CMC get noticeably faster with the
trough axis which reaches the central U.S. by Sunday. The 18z GFS
is much slower keeping the axis over the west coast. Prefer a
blend towards the better agreeable ensemble means which kind of
splits the difference between the two camps.

The last system to note is an area of low pressure expected to
form east of the Bahamas and track towards the north, off the East
Coast. The GFS is the strongest with possible tropical development
of this system bringing the low very near/over the Mid-Atlantic
coast. The ECMWF and CMC are farther off shore. A shortwave moving
over the Great Lakes should help to eventually push the system
east shunting any progression farther into the Northeast. These
differences obviously have huge implications for any kind of
rainfall across an already over saturated coastal
Mid-Atlantic/Northeast.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Expect multiple rounds of heavy rainfall near the Texas coast and
into parts of Louisiana through the middle of next week. Details
will be very sensitive to the evolution/track of a tropical
disturbance now emerging into the southwestern Gulf. A
well-defined/northward system could bring up to 10-15 inch
localized totals but potential also exists for a weaker and
farther southwest feature that would lead to rainfall that is less
extreme/focused. Even in this latter case the general pattern
could still favor areas of sufficiently heavy rainfall to be
hazardous. The forecast requires close monitoring given the
potential for some flash and urban flooding, particularly for more
sensitive locations... urban regions and those areas that have
already seen above normal rainfall over the past couple of weeks.

Mostly lighter rainfall will accompany frontal passages through
the central and northeastern parts of the CONUS. Some potential
exists for isolated/localized pockets of heavier amounts,
especially from the Midwest into far interior New England with a
leading front Tuesday-Wednesday. Moderate to locally heavy
rainfall may also reach the Pacific Northwest late this week with
some snow possible in the highest elevations of the Washington
Cascades. Some locations along the East Coast may see rainfall
with a wave that could track close to the Mid-Atlantic by late
this week.

The most persistent warm anomalies should be over portions of the
Great Lakes/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic/Northeast with some
readings 10-15F or so above normal over multiple days. In general
morning lows should be somewhat more above normal than daytime
highs. Surrounding areas may see more brief episodes of warmth
depending on frontal progression. The possible system near the
Mid-Atlantic late in the week would decrease high temperatures
somewhat. More moderate warm anomalies (plus 5-10F) should extend
back through the southern half of the West while clouds and
tropical moisture will keep western-central Gulf Coast highs
somewhat below normal. By the end of the week highs in the
Northwest should decrease to as much as 10-15F below normal as the
upper trough reaches the area. Downstream the amplifying pattern
could increase coverage of highs 10-15F above normal over the
Plains for next Saturday and into the upper midwest on Sunday.

...Developing tropical activity over the Bay of Campeche to
produce heavy rainfall and growing concerns for flash flooding
starting late Sunday and into the first half of next week for the
western Gulf Coast including coastal areas of Texas and
Louisiana...

...Stifling heat for mid-September to continue from the Southwest
and Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic...

...Severe weather possible for portions of the central and
northern Plains eastward into the Great Lakes and Northeast...

An area of disturbed weather over the Bay of Campeche has a high
likelihood of developing into a tropical depression later today or
Monday as this disturbance moves northwestward and then northward
near the coast of northeastern Mexico. A surge of tropical
moisture associated with this feature combined with a surface
trough extending north across the western Gulf of Mexico will
generate heavy showers and thunderstorms along the coastal areas
of Texas and Louisiana by late Sunday. This activity will spread
gradually farther inland across the western Gulf Coast region
through the first half of the week. Locally significant rainfall
totals are expected, potentially resulting in areas of coastal,
flash, and urban flooding. The slow progress of this system as
well as persistent moist southeasterly flow results in several
days worth of heavy rainfall from the Texas coast to southern
Louisiana. This long duration event is evident in the Weather
Prediction Center's Excessive Rainfall Outlooks as three days
worth (Sunday-Monday-Tuesday) of Slight Risks have been issued for
much of the western Gulf Coast. Interests from Brownsville, TX to
the mouth of the Mississippi River should continue to monitor the
situation closely. Please consult the latest National Hurricane
Center Tropical Weather Outlook for more information.

Elsewhere, an expansive dome of upper-level high pressure
stretching across the southern two-thirds of the U.S. mainland
allows for abnormally hot conditions to continue, with the heat
encompassing a broad area from the Southwest and Midwest to the
Mid-Atlantic. Temperatures will be as high as 15 to 20 degrees
above normal with the greatest concentration of these anomalously
hot conditions stretching from the central Plains to the
Mid-Atlantic. Record high temps will be challenged locally across
the southern High Plains and Southwest today, followed by parts of
the Mid-Atlantic by Monday. In fact, Excessive Heat Warnings
remains in place for parts of southwest Arizona and the Lower
Colorado River Valley for both today and Monday. Generally the
coolest temperatures are likely to be confined to the Pacific
Northwest and the northern Plains in wake of a pair of cold
frontal passages crossing the region.

A cold front crossing the Pacific Northwest and northern Plains
will be associated with an upper-level trough, which is expected
to gradually break down the aforementioned ridge of high pressure
over of the southern two-thirds of the nation by mid-week. As this
occurs, an elongated frontal zone with several waves of low
pressure advancing along it will be the catalyst for scattered
areas of heavy showers and thunderstorms. This will impact a broad
area from the central and northern Plains through the Midwest and
into the Northeast. Some localized severe weather is possible as
the Storm Prediction Center does have a Slight Risk of severe
weather currently depicted for Sunday across southern New York,
far northern Pennsylvania, and eastern Michigan. A Slight Risk of
severe weather is also highlighted in eastern Colorado today with
a large Marginal Risk area in the Northern Plains and Midwest on
Monday. Severe storms may contain damaging winds and large hail,
along with locally heavy rainfall rates that may lead to some
instances of flash flooding.

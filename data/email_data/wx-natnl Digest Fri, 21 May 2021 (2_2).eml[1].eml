Short Range Forecast Discussion

Valid 12Z Fri May 21 2021 - 12Z Sun May 23 2021

...Additional heavy rain associated with a developing low pressure
center over the western Gulf of Mexico could impact areas from
Texas Gulf Coast to Louisiana today followed by eastern Texas
tonight...

...Thunderstorms could become severe ahead of a cold front through
the High Plains for the next couple of days...

...Late-season snow will linger across higher elevations from the
Sierra Nevada to the northern Rockies into the weekend...

...Critical Risks of fire danger remain in place for portions of
the central Great Basin and Southwest...

Southeasterly winds circulating around a large high pressure
system centered over the northeastern U.S. will continue to direct
a stream of tropical moisture from the Gulf of Mexico toward the
western Gulf states.  Meanwhile, latest observations indicate that
a low pressure center is forming in the western Gulf of Mexico as
it begins to move northward toward the western Gulf Coast.  The
National Hurricane Center is monitoring this area for the
potential for tropical cyclone formation.  Heavy rain ahead of
this developing circulation continues to move across coastal
Louisiana early this morning.  Additional heavy rain could impact
areas from the Texas Gulf Coast to Louisiana today as the
developing low pressure center moves toward the western Gulf
Coast.  The continued threat of heavy rain will keep a Slight to
Moderate Risk of flash flooding over southern Louisiana to the
upper Texas coast today.

A deep upper-level low settling into the western U.S. will be slow
to exit the area for the next couple of days.  Areas along the
High Plains will remain under the threat of thunderstorms that
could turn severe as a strong cold front is forecast to approach
from the west during the weekend.  Underneath the upper low,
temperatures are expected to remain below normal for much of the
western U.S.  High temperatures are forecast to be more than 30
degrees below average for portions of Montana, with temperature
anomalies of 20 degrees below normal common for the Intermountain
West.  These cold temperatures will support wet snow from along
the Sierra Nevada, to the higher elevations of Nevada, into the
Intermountain West and the northern Rockies as the upper trough
lingers.  Winter Storm Warnings remain in effect for portions of
Montana into early this morning where snow totals could be over a
foot.  The mountain snow is expected to linger into the weekend
and then pick up again on Sunday as a low pressure system is
forecast to intensify over Wyoming.

Meanwhile, gusty winds across the interior West together with dry
conditions will continue to elevate the risk of wildfires.
Critical fire risk is forecast for much of the Central Great Basin
into the Four-Corners region.  Elsewhere, the northeastern U.S.
can expect increasing chances for scattered showers and
thunderstorms to end the week due to a meandering front.  Warmer
than average temperatures are forecast to continue for the Great
Lakes/Ohio Valley and Northeast/Mid-Atlantic over the next several
days, with highs rising well into the 80s and even into the 90s.
The northern Plains will continue to see periods of rain with
embedded thunderstorms as low pressure waves associated with a
front move across the area from time to time.

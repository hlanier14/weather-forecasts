.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0147 AM CST Wed Jan 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow will linger across much of the central and
western US from the rear flank of a broad cyclonic gyre across the
East. A weak cold front will move south, reaching central Texas
early this morning, as a second stronger front quickly approaches
this evening and overnight. The influx of cold air will moderate
temperatures and increase humidity values across much of the central
and southern Plains. Despite gusty west winds enhanced by momentum
transport from the strong flow aloft, the misalignment of gusty
surface winds and dry surface conditions should keep fire weather
concerns low through much of the forecast period. A few hours of
locally elevated conditions may develop in the lee of the southern
Rockies across portions of eastern NM where lower humidity may hold
out longer. However, confidence in this scenario is low.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0150 AM CST Wed Jan 05 2022/

...Synopsis...
Stronger flow aloft will begin to lift northward away from the
central and southern CONUS as troughing is amplified to the east and
sub tropical ridging develops across the Southwest. At the surface,
high pressure will strengthen in the post frontal airmass across the
central CONUS. The cold and stable airmass will limit the potential
overlap of strong surface winds and low humidity across much of the
US. As such, fire weather concerns are minimal through the forecast
period.

152 PM EST Wed Jan 05 2022

Valid 12Z Sat Jan 08 2022 - 12Z Wed Jan 12 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

An amplified but progressive upper level pattern should prevail
into the start of next week with a deep trough tracking from the
Rockies to the East Coast and a ridge axis moving into the western
U.S. from the eastern Pacific.  By early-mid week the pattern
should transition somewhat as eastern Pacific shortwave energy
splits around the western U.S. ridge--leading to a possible
southern stream trough reaching the southwestern U.S. and far
northwestern Mexico--and a flatter trend to the mean flow across
the eastern half of the country.  The main precipitation event
during the period will be an area of locally moderate to heavy
rainfall over parts of the South/Tennessee Valley this weekend,
aided by moist flow ahead of a cold front.  Another surge of cold
air will spread across the northern Plains through the Upper
Midwest Sunday into the first part of next week, followed by a
warmer trend over the central U.S.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to be well-behaved in terms of agreement and
continuity for about the first half of the period when the Pacific
into western U.S. upper ridge and downstream trough are dominant
and large-scale features.  Likewise forecasts for the cold front
ahead of the upper trough are fairly consistent.  A blend of
00Z/06Z operational models reflected consensus well for this part
of the forecast.  Then models and ensemble members continue to
vary for specifics of how eastern Pacific shortwave energy may
split as it nears the West Coast.  These differences ultimately
affect flow over/near the Southwest as well as locations east of
the Rockies, with northern stream flow determined in part by how
Pacific energy goes around the western U.S. ridge and southern
tier flow influenced by the pattern to the west.  For this more

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

Gulf moisture advecting northward ahead of a developing
Plains/Midwest cold front will support increasing coverage of
showers and thunderstorms from eastern Texas and the central Gulf
Coast to the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic region this weekend,
with lighter rainfall expected farther north.  There will likely
be some embedded heavier rainfall across portions of the Deep
South where convection is persistent.  Areas from the upper Great
Lakes to the Northeast could see wintry weather, with the best
snowfall prospects over northern New England and northern New
York.  Freezing rain and/or sleet may be among the hazards over
and near parts of the northern half of the Appalachians for a time
as moisture overruns cold air at the surface.  Parts of the Great
Lakes may see lake effect snow behind the passing front.  Dry
conditions will likely prevail over a majority of the lower 48
during the first half of next week.  Exceptions include some
showers and mountain snow over western Washington and Oregon as
one or more systems brush the region and some precipitation
spreading into the Southwest and southern Plains.  Precipitation
amounts will be sensitive to the exact details of the upper trough
approaching/reaching the Southwest.

On Saturday the Plains/Midwest will see some moderation of the
severe cold before the next arctic surge reaches into the northern
tier states by Sunday into Tuesday morning.  The second surge may
not be quite as intense as what is expected for the end of this
week, but temperatures could still be 10-25F below normal from
eastern Montana to Wisconsin.  The cold air will eventually reach
the East Coast as well, bringing highs down to 10-25F below normal
from the Mid-Atlantic through New England on Tuesday.  From
Saturday into Sunday above normal temperatures will progress from
the southern Plains to the Deep South and Southeast U.S.  Greatest
anomalies should be for overnight lows 15-25 degrees above normal
across the central Gulf Coast region Sunday morning.  The
northern-central Plains will trend warmer next week, reaching
10-15F or so above normal over some locations by
Tuesday-Wednesday.  Seasonably cold conditions are likely west of
the Continental Divide with readings generally within 10 degrees
of climatological averages.

...General Pattern Overview...

An amplified but progressive upper level pattern should prevail
into the start of next week with a deep trough tracking from the
Rockies to the East Coast and a ridge axis moving into the western
U.S. from the eastern Pacific.  By early-mid week the pattern
should transition somewhat as eastern Pacific shortwave energy
splits around the western U.S. ridge--leading to a possible
southern stream trough reaching the southwestern U.S. and far
northwestern Mexico--and a flatter trend to the mean flow across
the eastern half of the country.  The main precipitation event
during the period will be an area of locally moderate to heavy
rainfall over parts of the South/Tennessee Valley this weekend,
aided by moist flow ahead of a cold front.  Another surge of cold
air will spread across the northern Plains through the Upper
Midwest Sunday into the first part of next week, followed by a
warmer trend over the central U.S.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Guidance continues to be well-behaved in terms of agreement and
continuity for about the first half of the period when the Pacific
into western U.S. upper ridge and downstream trough are dominant
and large-scale features.  Likewise forecasts for the cold front
ahead of the upper trough are fairly consistent.  A blend of
00Z/06Z operational models reflected consensus well for this part
of the forecast.  Then models and ensemble members continue to
vary for specifics of how eastern Pacific shortwave energy may
split as it nears the West Coast.  These differences ultimately
affect flow over/near the Southwest as well as locations east of
the Rockies, with northern stream flow determined in part by how
Pacific energy goes around the western U.S. ridge and southern
tier flow influenced by the pattern to the west.  For this more
uncertain part of the forecast, transitioning to a blend of models
and GEFS/ECMWF means helped to keep the overall evolution fairly
stable with only modest refinements in detail.

...Coastal heavy rain and mountain snow threat from the Pacific
Northwest into the northern/central Rockies and central High
Plains...

...Heavy Lake effect snow threat to continue through Friday...

...Much below normal temperatures will spread from the Great
Plains into the Midwest...

...Another winter storm possible from the Tennessee Valley to the
Northeast Thursday into Friday...


An active weather pattern will continue to direct a plume of
Pacific moisture towards the Northwestern U.S. the next couple of
days. This will result in a threat for heavy to excessive
rainfall, mainly for favorable upslope regions along the
Washington and northern Oregon coasts where WPC is currently
highlighting a slight risk in this location for Friday. Meanwhile,
sufficient cold air will spill into the Pacific Northwest and
northern/central Rockies setting the stage for potentially
significant snowfall in the higher terrain, measured in feet.
Accumulating snow and ice is also possible in the lower elevations
of eastern Washington into Friday.

A low pressure system lifting across the Great Lakes region and
into eastern Canada will allow for heavy lake effect snow as
chilly westerly winds blow over the still relatively warm lakes.
Favorable locations downwind of the lakes could see 6 to 12 inches
of snow, with locally higher amounts. Behind this system, arctic
air will surge farther south and east into the Great Plains and
eventually the Midwest by Friday. Sub-zero daytime highs will
engulf the northern Plains the next couple of days while
temperatures as much as 20-25 degrees below normal will overspread
the central Plains, parts of the southern Plains, and eastward
into the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Friday.

By Thursday, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along
an arctic front draped across the Deep South. Moderate snowfall is
possible to the north of the front from Kansas into Missouri where
at least a couple of inches of snow is forecast. As the low tracks
through the Southeast on Thursday, heavy snowfall is expected to
develop across parts of the Tennessee Valley into the central
Appalachians, with some ice farther to the south across
southern/eastern Tennessee and northern Mississippi and Alabama.
The combination of snow and ice may cause hazardous road
conditions through Thursday night in this region. As the low moves
off the Mid-Atlantic coast and rapidly deepens offshore,
accumulating snow will also spread into the Mid-Atlantic and the
Northeast, where a few inches are possible. Higher amounts may be
realized across especially eastern portions of New England, but
exact amounts remain uncertain and highly dependent on the exact
track of the low off the coast.

during the first half of next week.  Exceptions include some
showers and mountain snow over western Washington and Oregon as
one or more systems brush the region and some precipitation
spreading into the Southwest and southern Plains.  Precipitation
amounts will be sensitive to the exact details of the upper trough
approaching/reaching the Southwest.

On Saturday the Plains/Midwest will see some moderation of the
severe cold before the next arctic surge reaches into the northern
tier states by Sunday into Tuesday morning.  The second surge may
not be quite as intense as what is expected for the end of this
week, but temperatures could still be 10-25F below normal from
eastern Montana to Wisconsin.  The cold air will eventually reach
the East Coast as well, bringing highs down to 10-25F below normal
from the Mid-Atlantic through New England on Tuesday.  From
Saturday into Sunday above normal temperatures will progress from
the southern Plains to the Deep South and Southeast U.S.  Greatest
anomalies should be for overnight lows 15-25 degrees above normal
across the central Gulf Coast region Sunday morning.  The
northern-central Plains will trend warmer next week, reaching
10-15F or so above normal over some locations by
Tuesday-Wednesday.  Seasonably cold conditions are likely west of
the Continental Divide with readings generally within 10 degrees
of climatological averages.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
147 AM EST Thu Jan 6 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 9 2022 - 12Z Thu Jan 13 2022

...General Pattern Overview...

A deep upper level trough coupled with an arctic surface high will
be present across the north-central U.S. and then the East Coast
through Tuesday with an amplified upper level flow pattern in
place, and an upper ridge over the West Coast on Sunday.  A split
flow pattern develops over the eastern Pacific and this leads to a
potential closed low near the Desert Southwest, and progressive
shortwave impulses tracking from western Canada to the Great Lakes
through the middle of the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The 00Z model guidance suite and ensembles continue to agree quite
well on the overall synoptic scale pattern, particularly through
Monday.  Going in early next week, the models still have a good
handle on the deep trough over the East Coast region and the
timing of the cold front passage.  Then models and ensemble
members continue to vary for specifics of how eastern Pacific
shortwave energy may split as it nears the West Coast.  These
differences ultimately affect flow over/near the Southwest as well
as locations east of the Rockies, with northern stream flow
determined in part by how Pacific energy goes around the western
U.S. ridge and southern tier flow influenced by the pattern to the
west.

The WPC forecast was based primarily on a multi-deterministic
model blend through Tuesday, and then gradually increasing use of
the ECENS and GEFS means through early next week while still
keeping about 50 percent of a CMC/ECMWF/GFS blend..

...Hazards/Sensible Weather Highlights...

Gulf moisture advecting northward ahead of a developing
Plains/Midwest cold front will support increasing coverage of
showers and thunderstorms from eastern Texas and the central Gulf
Coast to the central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic region this
weekend, with lighter precipitation expected farther north.  There
will likely be some embedded heavier rainfall across portions of
the Deep South where convection is persistent, and some localized
flooding is within the realm of possibility.  Areas from the upper
Great Lakes to the Northeast could see wintry weather, with the
best snowfall prospects over Michigan and northern New York as a
result of lake effect snow.  Freezing rain and/or sleet may be
among the hazards over and near parts of the northern half of the
Appalachians for a time as moisture overruns cold air at the
surface.  Dry conditions will likely prevail over a majority of
the country for Monday and Tuesday.  Exceptions include some
showers and mountain snow over western Washington and Oregon as
one or more systems cross the region and some precipitation over
the Southwest and southern Plains by Wednesday.

The next blast of arctic air makes its presence known across the
Northern Plains and Upper Midwest by Sunday in the wake of the
strong cold front, and this cold weather will eventually reach the
East Coast in modified form as well, bringing highs down to 10-25F
below normal from the Mid-Atlantic through New England on Tuesday
for one of the coldest days of the year thus far.  It should still
be rather mild across the Southeast U.S. ahead of the front on
Sunday before a return to reality by Monday.  The northern-central
Plains will trend warmer next week, reaching 10-15F or so above
normal over some locations by Tuesday-Wednesday.  Seasonably cold
conditions are likely west of the Continental Divide with readings
generally within 10 degrees of climatological averages.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow will begin to slowly lift away from the
central CONUS through the forecast period as troughing over the Ohio
valley shifts eastward and subtropical ridging strengthens across
the Southwest. At the surface, Arctic high pressure in the wake of
the cold front accelerating toward the GOM will bring much colder
temperatures to central and southern parts of the country. The cold
and stable conditions at the surface should result in very little
overlap with strong winds despite dry conditions. As such, fire
weather concerns appear very low through the forecast period.

...Coastal heavy rain, mountain snow and inland icing threat from
the Pacific Northwest into the Northern/Central Rockies...

...Heavy Lake effect snow continues today...

...Much below normal temperatures will spread from the Great
Plains into the Midwest...

...Another winter storm possible from the Tennessee Valley to the
Northeast through Friday...


An active weather pattern will continue to direct a plume of
Pacific moisture towards the Northwestern U.S. over the next
couple of days. This will result in a threat for heavy to
excessive rainfall, mainly for favorable upslope regions along the
Washington and northern Oregon coasts where WPC is currently
highlighting a Slight Risk in this location for Friday. Meanwhile,
sufficient cold air will spill into the Pacific Northwest and
Northern/Central Rockies setting the stage for potentially
significant snowfall in the higher terrain, measured in feet.
Accumulating snow and ice is also possible in the lower elevations
of eastern Washington into Friday. Winter Storm Warnings and
Advisories are in effect for much of the Northwest.

A low pressure system lifting into eastern Canada will allow for
heavy lake effect snow as chilly westerly winds blow over the
still relatively warm lakes. Favorable locations downwind of the
lakes could see 6 to 12 inches of snow by Saturday morning, with
locally higher amounts. Behind the cold front associated with this
system, arctic air will surge farther south and east into the
Great Plains and eventually the Midwest by Friday. Sub-zero
daytime highs will engulf the northern Plains today while
temperatures as much as 20-25 degrees below normal will overspread
the Central Plains, parts of the southern Plains, and eastward
into the Midwest and Ohio Valley on Friday.

Today, a wave of low pressure is forecast to develop along the
arctic front draped across the Deep South. Light snowfall is
possible to the north of the front from Kansas into Missouri where
a couple of inches of snow is forecast. As the low tracks through
the Southeast today, heavy snowfall is expected to develop across
parts of the Tennessee Valley into the Central Appalachians, with
some ice farther to the south across portions of southern/eastern
Tennessee and northern Mississippi/Alabama. The combination of
snow and ice may cause hazardous road conditions through tonight
in this region. As the low moves off the Mid-Atlantic coast Friday
morning and rapidly deepens offshore, accumulating snow will also
spread into the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast, where a few inches
are possible. Higher amounts may be realized across eastern
portions of New England, but exact amounts remain uncertain and
highly dependent on the exact track of the low off the coast.
Winter Storm Warnings and Advisories are in effect for much of the
Tennessee Valley, Central Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic. The
departing low pressure system will produce moderate lake effect
snow over the Lower Great Lakes while simultaneously generating
high winds across the Northeast.

0151 AM CST Thu Jan 06 2022

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The general flow pattern aloft across the CONUS will remain active
with troughing over the East followed by shortwave ridging and a
secondary trough across the West. The shortwave ridge will undergo
amplification through the day as it shifts over the Southwest and
southern High Plains. The surface high is forecast to move east
allowing westerly surface flow to develop across the southern High
Plains later in the afternoon. The cold, but dry airmass may support
a few hours of locally elevated fire weather conditions as
temperatures begin to recover.

...Southern High Plains...
As low-level pressure gradients begin to pickup with the eastward
shift of the surface high pressure over the Southeastern US,
west/southwesterly winds will increase off of the higher terrain
across portions of eastern NM and into the western TX Panhandle.
Hampered somewhat by the northward retreating mid-level flow,
surface winds will likely struggle to reach near 15 mph. The airmass
across the Plains should warm fairly quickly despite the burst of
Arctic air following the cold front several days prior. Fuels remain
very dry, and surface humidity values of 15-25% appear plausible by
late afternoon given downslope drying and warming of the already dry
airmass. A few hours of locally elevated fire weather potential may
develop where winds can reach near 15 mph. However, confidence in
the spatial coverage of this is low.

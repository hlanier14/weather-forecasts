Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1005 AM CST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Morning water-vapor imagery shows a
region of subsidence on the backside of an upper-level shortwave
trough currently moving southward towards the Four Corners. This
will help support increasing winds and the potential for elevated
fire weather conditions across the lower CO River Valley and coastal
southern CA for today/tonight. Although a slight drying trend is
noted, fuel guidance continues to show ERC values near or below the
50th percentile, which should mitigate the overall fire weather
threat. See the previous discussion for additional details.

..Moore.. 01/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1233 AM CST Thu Jan 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale upper-level trough across the central and eastern U.S.
will intensify while an upper-level ridge amplifies along the West
Coast. At the surface, high pressure will build from the Great Basin
into the Plains and the upper Midwest. Colder conditions will
continue across much of the country as a result. The strong high
pressure system in the Great Basin will drive breezy conditions from
southern California into the lower Colorado River Valley. While RH
could drop to around 15% in some locations, fuels remain relatively
moist and are not expected to support significant fire spread.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 03 2022

...Overview...

By the start of the medium range period early Sunday, the deep
system tracking just off the East Coast late this week into the
weekend should reach a position east or northeast of Maine, still
supporting some strong winds even if precipitation tapers off.
This storm will continue moving rapidly away from New England
during the day Sunday. For information on the storm's effects
before early Sunday consult the WPC website for updated Key
Messages and check your local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:=
//weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PM=
Gc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ . Through the
rest of the period, the dominant theme will be a significant
pattern change as an upper trough strongly amplifies from the
northeastern Pacific into the western/central U.S. while a strong
ridge builds and then persists over the eastern Pacific, and
another ridge crossing the East Coast Tuesday settles over the
western Atlantic thereafter. This evolution will initially spread
precipitation across the West and then likely produce significant
precipitation farther eastward as a leading front interacts with a
strong flow of Gulf moisture, with the possibility of wintry
weather on the backside of the front. Ahead of the trough, a
southern stream shortwave/upper low may generate some enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast around Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

An operational model blend early in the period favoring the
00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF and CMC followed by a transition toward
about half the total weight of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means continued
to provide a good representation of consensus ideas, with mainly
just typical run-to-run detail changes versus previous cycle. For
the storm producing lingering effects over New England, there are
still meaningful differences in the short range due in part to
fine-scale issues with the supporting upper low, so there is still
a fair amount of uncertainty over the exact location/structure of
the storm as of early Sunday. Overall the latest GFS/GEFS mean
continue to be on the faster side and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean are
slowest, conforming to long-historical tendencies.

Meanwhile guidance continues to consolidate for the handling of
the southern stream shortwave/upper low emerging from the
Southwest, with the 00Z UKMET straying faster than most other
solutions. This feature should rapidly shear out beyond the
Plains. Farther west, there are still differences in how some
energy pulls off from the southwestern part of the shortwave
approaching the West Coast Sunday but now with less pronounced
spread than in previous cycles. As the larger scale upper trough
digs into the western/central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the ensemble
means and a multi-run average of operational runs suggest above
average predictability for the large-scale feature while
individual members/model runs show embedded detail uncertainties.
Examples of the latter include to what degree flow may separate
near the Four Corners region around Wednesday and the character of
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough by Thursday. GFS
runs have been persistent with a stronger feature for the latter
compared to the ECMWF runs, and these differences do affect the
width of the troughing as well as the axis somewhat, and the
timing of the surface cold front pushing ahead of the trough. The
blend of deterministic and ensemble guidance used for the end of
the period worked as a compromise at this point.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect strong winds over New England at the start of Sunday to
moderate over the course of the day as strong low pressure tracks
rapidly away from the region. Otherwise the effects of the initial
storm will be in the short range. See the WPC website for latest
Key Messages on the system and additional information in the

!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

The upper trough/low reaching the Southwest by early Sunday should
produce little if any precipitation over that region. However, as
the feature continues eastward, there will be some potential for
locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas across parts
of the Gulf Coast region during the first half of the week. Best
potential at this time appears to be over eastern Texas with lower
confidence in details farther east. Some aspects of this event may
hinge on small-scale details not easily resolved very far in
advance. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Sunday-Tuesday will spread moderate amounts of rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward and
southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest totals are likely
to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be too extreme. In
general the forecast remains on track for a significant increase
of coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central
U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best potential for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Wintry weather
will be possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield,
with at least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details with the wintry precipitation in the colder air
may be more dependent on lower-confidence details of ejecting
shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Cold conditions near the East Coast will extend through Sunday
with many areas 10-20F below normal. Subfreezing lows should
extend into portions of Florida and parts of the Florida Peninsula
may challenge daily records for both morning lows and daytime
highs. Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures
Sunday into the first part of next work week, with some
northern/central areas possibly seeing plus 20F or greater
anomalies on one or two days. This warm air will progress into the
eastern half of the country Tuesday-Thursday, bringing a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal and perhaps greater
anomalies for lows over the Northeast by Thursday. Also during
Tuesday-Thursday much of the West and then into the Plains will
see an episode of chilly temperatures with the Rockies and Plains
seeing the best potential for readings 10-20F below normal.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
158 PM EST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 03 2022

...Overview...

By the start of the medium range period early Sunday, the deep
system tracking just off the East Coast late this week into the
weekend should reach a position east or northeast of Maine, still
supporting some strong winds even if precipitation tapers off.
This storm will continue moving rapidly away from New England
during the day Sunday. For information on the storm's effects
before early Sunday consult the WPC website for updated Key
Messages and check your local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:=
//weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PM=
Gc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ . Through the
rest of the period, the dominant theme will be a significant
pattern change as an upper trough strongly amplifies from the
northeastern Pacific into the western/central U.S. while a strong
ridge builds and then persists over the eastern Pacific, and
another ridge crossing the East Coast Tuesday settles over the
western Atlantic thereafter. This evolution will initially spread
precipitation across the West and then likely produce significant
precipitation farther eastward as a leading front interacts with a
strong flow of Gulf moisture, with the possibility of wintry
weather on the backside of the front. Ahead of the trough, a
southern stream shortwave/upper low may generate some enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast around Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

An operational model blend early in the period favoring the
00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF and CMC followed by a transition toward
about half the total weight of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means continued
to provide a good representation of consensus ideas, with mainly
just typical run-to-run detail changes versus previous cycle. For
the storm producing lingering effects over New England, there are
still meaningful differences in the short range due in part to
fine-scale issues with the supporting upper low, so there is still
a fair amount of uncertainty over the exact location/structure of
the storm as of early Sunday. Overall the latest GFS/GEFS mean
continue to be on the faster side and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean are
slowest, conforming to long-historical tendencies.

Meanwhile guidance continues to consolidate for the handling of
the southern stream shortwave/upper low emerging from the
Southwest, with the 00Z UKMET straying faster than most other
solutions. This feature should rapidly shear out beyond the
Plains. Farther west, there are still differences in how some
energy pulls off from the southwestern part of the shortwave
approaching the West Coast Sunday but now with less pronounced
spread than in previous cycles. As the larger scale upper trough
digs into the western/central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the ensemble
means and a multi-run average of operational runs suggest above
average predictability for the large-scale feature while
individual members/model runs show embedded detail uncertainties.
Examples of the latter include to what degree flow may separate
near the Four Corners region around Wednesday and the character of
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough by Thursday. GFS
runs have been persistent with a stronger feature for the latter
compared to the ECMWF runs, and these differences do affect the
width of the troughing as well as the axis somewhat, and the
timing of the surface cold front pushing ahead of the trough. The
blend of deterministic and ensemble guidance used for the end of
the period worked as a compromise at this point.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EST January 27 2022

SYNOPSIS: There is good agreement among the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means indicating mid-level low pressure moving eastward across the
eastern half of the lower 48 from the beginning to middle portion of week-2=
,
although there are differences regarding the details of the placement,
amplitude, and exact timing of this feature. This pattern favors increased
risk
of much below normal temperatures across much of the eastern half of the
contiguous U.S. at the beginning of the period. Potential for heavy snow ma=
y
linger over the Northeast as a surface low and its trailing front exits the
East at the beginning of the period. Some recent model runs indicate the
possibility of a strong surface low traversing the Northern Plains, which
could
enhance chances for high winds in the area at the beginning of the period. =
A
series of surface lows are anticipated to form over the Aleutians during
week-2, which could promote enhanced precipitation and high elevation snowf=
all
to parts of the southeastern Mainland Alaska and Alaska Panhandle at the
beginning of the period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the
Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohio Valleys, Southern Plains and Southeast,
Fri-Sat, Feb 4-5.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of the Southwest=
,
southern Rockies, and the eastern half of the CONUS, Fri-Sun, Feb 4-6.

Slight risk of heavy snow across parts of the Northeast, Fri, Feb 4.

Slight risk of high winds across parts of the Northern and Central Plains,

frv7vV0BOqR$

FOR FRIDAY FEBRUARY 04 - THURSDAY FEBRUARY 10: In general there is relative=
ly
good multi-model agreement indicating mid-level troughing across the easter=
n
half of the CONUS at the beginning of the period, with amplified ridging
across
the Northeast Pacific and western CONUS. The mid-level troughing across the
eastern CONUS is anticipated to gradually deamplify by the middle of week-2=
,
transitioning to ridging across the eastern half of the CONUS toward the en=
d
of
the period.  Similar to yesterday's outlook the ECMWF ensemble mean continu=
es
to be more progressive than the GEFS with the mid-level height pattern, wit=
h a
positive trough axis being centered over the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys at =
the
start of week-2. The GEFS mean, however, depicts a predominantly stable, an=
d
negatively tilted axis extending from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi
Valley. The Canadian ensemble mean favors a broad trough, with a weaker
amplitude than the GEFS and ECMWF. These models indicate a transition to
ridging (troughing) over the eastern (western) CONUS toward the end of the
period as the ridging over the Northeast Pacific gradually retrogrades.



The mid-level troughing across the eastern CONUS favors an anomalous cold
pattern across the region, extending into portions of the Southwest. A slig=
ht
risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for parts of the Southwest=
,
Southern Rockies, and the eastern half of the CONUS, Feb 4 to 6, where the
GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools show the most agreement with at least a 20% chan=
ce
of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and ranging t=
o
below 0 Deg F across the Midwest and Northeast, to freezing temperatures
across
the southern tier. The GEFS reforecast tool maintains reaching these
thresholds
throughout much of week-2, whereas the ECMWF significantly weakens the cold
signal by day 11 (Feb 7). Due to the week-2 mean skill weighted temperature
tool favoring the ECMWF reforecast tool, this cold temperature hazard is no=
t
prolonged throughout the period. A moderate risk of much below normal
temperatures is designated for parts of the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Ohi=
o
Valleys, Southern Plains and Southeast, Feb 4 to 5, where there is relative=
ly
good agreement between the reforecast tools indicating at least a 40% chanc=
e
of
minimum temperatures reaching hazards criteria.



As a surface low exits the Northeast at the outset of the period, its
associated front may support lingering increased chances for heavy snow acr=
oss
parts of the Northeast at the beginning of the period.  The 0Z ECMWF ensemb=
le
mean shows the greatest potential for lingering heavy precipitation across =
New
England, compared to the GEFS and Canadian. Despite reforecast tools not
showing elevated probabilities of 3-day liquid equivalent totals reaching
hazards criteria, a slight risk of heavy snow is posted for parts of the
Northeast, Feb 4, primarily based on the uncalibrated ensembles and recent
deterministic model solutions. Recent deterministic runs have indicated the
possibility of a surface low forming off the coast of the Carolinas by Feb =
5
and tracking near the East Coast, which could bring heavy precipitation to
parts of the Eastern Seaboard, with potential for heavy snow and icing to s=
ome
areas. Recent runs from the GEFS ensemble have also indicated this potentia=
l
for this low formation. The deterministic ECMWF, however, does not support
this
feature. Significant model differences and high uncertainty precludes
designation of related precipitation hazards, but this potential feature wi=
ll
be monitored in the upcoming days.



There is significant disagreement among the week-2 ensemble means regarding
the
mid-level height pattern over Alaska. The ECMWF ensemble mean favors negati=
ve
mid-level height departures for the week-2 mean, whereas the GEFS and Canad=
ian
ensembles indicate positive height anomalies over much of Alaska, excluding
the
western Aleutians. This translates to the ECMWF reforecast tool showing a
stronger signal of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percenti=
le
across the northern Mainland compared to the GEFS. Due to these significant
model differences, a much below normal temperature is not posted for Alaska=
 at
this time.



There is a good multi-model depiction of surface low pressure forming over =
the
Aleutians at the start of the period, although due to significant model
differences in the aforementioned mid-level pattern, there are noticeable
differences regarding the orientation and evolution of the surface low. The
ECMWF and Canadian ensemble means depiction of the surface low would be mor=
e
conducive to heavy precipitation extending, from the southeastern Mainland =
to
the Alaska Panhandle, compared to the GEFS. These differences are also
reflected in the reforecast tools, with the ECMWF indicating at least a 20%
chance of 3-day liquid equivalent totals exceeding the 85th percentile,
whereas
the GEFS keeps probabilities of reaching this threshold to below 20%. The
uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble mean indicates 3-day totals possibly reaching 2
inches over this area. Despite these differences,, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for parts of southeastern Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, Feb 4 to 6, with a slight risk of heavy snow highlighted over
higher
elevation areas for the same period.



The potential for surface low formations also , could support localized hea=
vy
winds across portions of south-central and southeastern Mainland Alaska. Th=
e
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of wind speeds exceeding th=
e
85th percentile and 45 mph across some of the aforementioned areas. However=
,
given  the aforementioned uncertainty at this time regarding the evolution =
of
surface lows in the region, a related wind hazard is not included at this
time.

...Powerful winter storm to produce significant impacts across
parts of New England and potentially into eastern sections of the
Mid-Atlantic on Saturday...

...Well below average temperatures to spread over the eastern U.S.
to start the weekend...

The most noteworthy weather story heading into the last weekend of
January will be associated with a strengthening Nor'easter
forecast to move up the East Coast. Ahead of the main system
strengthening off the Carolina coast, an approaching cold front is
expected to push through the Great Lakes tonight and into the
Northeast/Central Appalachians on Friday. This will aid in
producing light snow from the western Ohio Valley to southern New
England. As an upper-level trough deepens over the Southeast and
turn negatively-tilted Friday night, rapid strengthening of the
aforementioned low pressure system is expected. The low pressure
center is then forecast to track north-northeast and churn off the
coast of Cape Cod by Saturday night. Light snow is expected to
initially overspread much of the Mid-Atlantic and Carolinas Friday
night into Saturday morning, with overall snowfall amounts under 3
inches. Meanwhile, moderate-to-heavy snow is possible by Saturday
morning along coastal sections of the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast,
as well as New England. Snow is forecast to continue across this
region into Saturday night, as well as the potential for
increasing wind gusts. Parts of southern New England, particularly
eastern Massachusetts, Long Island, Rhode Island, and Cape Cod can
anticipate significant impacts associated with heavy snow rates
and gusty winds. Here, total snowfall amounts may add up to over
20 inches by the time the system exits on Sunday. Additionally,
significant coastal impacts are possible, including coastal
flooding and beach erosion. The greatest uncertainty with the
snowfall forecast lies along the I-95 corridor from Richmond, VA
to Hartford, CT, where the western edge of the highest potential
snowfall amounts exist. The gradient between little snowfall to
over 6 inches will likely be very tight. Therefore, any slight
shift in the current forecast can have drastic effects on
potential impacts. Residents are urged to continue checking for
the latest forecast in order to receive the most up to date
information.

Meanwhile, the next surge of arctic air is currently located over
the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes and will continue diving southward
into much of the eastern U.S. by Saturday. Well below average
temperatures will reach as far south as the Gulf Coast States,
including most of Florida. In fact, highs on Saturday will
struggle to reach out of the 40s and 50s throughout the Sunshine
State. Potentially dangerous subzero wind chills are also possible
throughout the Northeast by Saturday night.

Other areas of precipitation include light snow across parts of
the Southern Rockies tonight and isolated showers through most of
southern Texas on Friday. Dry and tranquil conditions can be
expected elsewhere over the the central and western U.S. under the
influence of a potent upper-level ridge.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast (below) remains on track. Recent hi-res
guidance continues to show the potential for elevated fire weather
conditions across parts of southwest SD into western/central NE with
RH values falling into the low 20s and possibly upper teens.
However, these solutions have typically featured over-mixing in the
boundary layer and a low RH bias in recent days. Recent ensemble
guidance roughly supports this idea with only modest probabilities
of RH falling to 20%. Nonetheless, strong winds are still expected
across this region and fuels are very dry for this time of year amid
the absence of a broader snow pack (per latest NOHRSC analyses).
While confidence remains too low for highlights at this time, a risk
area may be introduced if guidance and observations trend towards
the drier solutions.

..Moore.. 01/27/2022

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1235 AM CST Thu Jan 27 2022/

...Synopsis...
For Friday, the eastern upper-level trough is expected to intensify
through the day. The upper-level ridge in the West will
simultaneously broaden. A surface low is forecast to develop in the
Canadian Prairie with a trough extending into the central Plains.
The Great Basin surface high pressure system is expected to maintain
strength.

As has been the case for the past few days, offshore/downslope winds
will continue in southern California and the lower Colorado River
Valley. While fuels have dried some, fuel indices are still around
seasonal normals. Fire weather concerns are still expected to be
low.

In the central/southern Plains, areas of dry and windy conditions
are possible due to the strong high pressure west of the Divide and
the developing trough to the east. There is higher confidence in low
RH in the southern High Plains, but recent snowfall will temper fire
weather concerns there. Portions of western/central Nebraska into
central Kansas could see gusty winds. There is a fair amount of
uncertainty regarding the temperature/RH, however. With some colder
air and possible light snowfall moving in on Thursday, it is unclear
whether the temperatures will be warm enough to support critically
low RH and deeper boundary-layer mixing. With dry fuels in place
across these areas, some locally elevated concerns may develop.
Broader concerns are possible if temperatures end up warmer than
anticipated.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EST Thu January 27 2022

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 02 - 06 2022

Today=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BDs model solutions are in good agreement in =
depicting an amplified 500-
hPa
flow pattern across the forecast domain. In the mean mid-level height field=
s,
a
trough is forecast over the western Aleutians,  while anomalous ridging is
predicted across the Gulf of Alaska and parts of the western CONUS. Anomalo=
us
troughing is forecast over the central CONUS, extending southward to the
Southern Rockies. Anomalous ridging and associated above normal 500-hPa
heights
are likely across much of the eastern CONUS..

Increased below normal temperature probabilities are indicated over norther=
n
Mainland Alaska, consistent with the consolidation tool. Above normal
temperatures are likely for the Aleutian Islands, Alaska Panhandle, and
southern Mainland Alaska associated with above normal 500-hPa heights.
Troughing over the central CONUS favors elevated probabilities for near to
below normal temperatures over the western and central CONUS extending to w=
est
of the eastern CONUS. Conversely, ridging and above normal 500-hPa heights
over
the eastern CONUS lead to increased chances of above-normal temperatures on
the
Atlantic Seaboard.

Mean southwesterly flow leads to increased chances of above normal
precipitation over much of Alaska. The potential for enhanced offshore flow
increases chances of below normal precipitation for parts of the western CO=
NUS
eastward to the central-central CONUS. Above normal precipitation is favore=
d
over much of the eastern CONUS, parts of the Northern Plains and Great Lake=
s,
and much of the Gulf Coast, associated with cyclonic flow and potential sto=
rm
systems development.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Yesterday's 12z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 7, and 10% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 3 out of 5, due=
 to
agreement between model forecasts on the mean circulation pattern, offset b=
y
some disagreement among the temperature and precipitation tools.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR FEB 04 - 10 2022

The week-2 manual blend of model 500-hPa forecasts is generally similar to =
the
6-10 day period. However, predicted 500-hPa height anomalies are less
amplified
than in the 6-10 day period blend, as uncertainty among the model forecasts
increases. Ridging persists for the Gulf Alaska and western CONUS into the
week
2 period, with downstream troughing progressing eastward in week 2 relative=
 to
the 6-10 day period.

Below normal temperatures are slightly favored for northwestern Mainland
Alaska
for week-2, under continued anomalous northwesterly flow. Above normal
temperatures are favored over southern and central  Mainland Alaska, the
Aleutians, and Alaska Panhandle under southerly surface flow, supported by =
the
temperature consolidation tool. Below normal temperatures are favored for t=
he
eastern CONUS, the Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Southern Plains and par=
ts
of the southern Rockies, under a predicted trough. Near to above normal
temperatures are favored over the western CONUS, parts of the Northern
Rockies,
Northern and Middle Plains in week-2, as mid-level heights are predicted to
rise during the period.

Above normal precipitation is favored for much of Alaska under predicted
southwesterly 500-hPa flow in the manual blend. Below normal precipitation =
is
favored for the western CONUS eastward to the Middle central CONUS associat=
ed
with mean surface high pressure predicted across most of these regions. Abo=
ve
normal precipitation is favored for parts of  the Northern Plains, Upper
Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes, Gulf Coast and the eastern CONUS, associat=
ed
with mean cyclonic flow.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

z
European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 10, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Below average, 2 out of 5, due=
 to
only fair model agreement on the circulation pattern for week 2, as well as
weak signals in the temperature and precipitation tools.

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1991-2020 base period means as reference=
 in
the climate outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
February 17.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
434 PM EST Thu Jan 27 2022

Valid 12Z Sun Jan 30 2022 - 12Z Thu Feb 03 2022

...Overview...

By the start of the medium range period early Sunday, the deep
system tracking just off the East Coast late this week into the
weekend should reach a position east or northeast of Maine, still
supporting some strong winds even if precipitation tapers off.
This storm will continue moving rapidly away from New England
during the day Sunday. For information on the storm's effects
before early Sunday consult the WPC website for updated Key
Messages and check your local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:=
//weather.gov__;!!K543PA!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PM=
Gc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ . Through the
rest of the period, the dominant theme will be a significant
pattern change as an upper trough strongly amplifies from the
northeastern Pacific into the western/central U.S. while a strong
ridge builds and then persists over the eastern Pacific, and
another ridge crossing the East Coast Tuesday settles over the
western Atlantic thereafter. This evolution will initially spread
precipitation across the West and then likely produce significant
precipitation farther eastward as a leading front interacts with a
strong flow of Gulf moisture, with the possibility of wintry
weather on the backside of the front. Ahead of the trough, a
southern stream shortwave/upper low may generate some enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast around Monday.

...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

An operational model blend early in the period favoring the
00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z ECMWF and CMC followed by a transition toward
about half the total weight of 06Z GEFS/00Z ECMWF means continued
to provide a good representation of consensus ideas, with mainly
just typical run-to-run detail changes versus previous cycle. For
the storm producing lingering effects over New England, there are
still meaningful differences in the short range due in part to
fine-scale issues with the supporting upper low, so there is still
a fair amount of uncertainty over the exact location/structure of
the storm as of early Sunday. Overall the latest GFS/GEFS mean
continue to be on the faster side and the ECMWF/ECMWF mean are
slowest, conforming to long-historical tendencies.

Meanwhile guidance continues to consolidate for the handling of
the southern stream shortwave/upper low emerging from the
Southwest, with the 00Z UKMET straying faster than most other
solutions. This feature should rapidly shear out beyond the
Plains. Farther west, there are still differences in how some
energy pulls off from the southwestern part of the shortwave
approaching the West Coast Sunday but now with less pronounced
spread than in previous cycles. As the larger scale upper trough
digs into the western/central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the ensemble
means and a multi-run average of operational runs suggest above
average predictability for the large-scale feature while
individual members/model runs show embedded detail uncertainties.
Examples of the latter include to what degree flow may separate
near the Four Corners region around Wednesday and the character of
upstream energy dropping into the mean trough by Thursday. GFS
runs have been persistent with a stronger feature for the latter
compared to the ECMWF runs, and these differences do affect the
width of the troughing as well as the axis somewhat, and the
timing of the surface cold front pushing ahead of the trough. The
blend of deterministic and ensemble guidance used for the end of
the period worked as a compromise at this point.

...Weather Highlights/Threats...

Expect strong winds over New England at the start of Sunday to
moderate over the course of the day as strong low pressure tracks
rapidly away from the region. Otherwise the effects of the initial
storm will be in the short range. See the WPC website for latest
Key Messages on the system and additional information in the
Probabilistic Heavy Snow and Icing Discussion, plus check your
local forecast at https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://weather.gov__;!!K543PA=
!fOOul-B8w0n6KzO5OHQwNrtdMjFmG3IimVn--mJmw3Wnsvx6PMGc_0UkiDYNGePKBwA$ .

The upper trough/low reaching the Southwest by early Sunday should
produce little if any precipitation over that region. However, as
the feature continues eastward, there will be some potential for
locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas across parts
of the Gulf Coast region during the first half of the week. Best
potential at this time appears to be over eastern Texas with lower
confidence in details farther east. Some aspects of this event may
hinge on small-scale details not easily resolved very far in
advance. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Sunday-Tuesday will spread moderate amounts of rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward and
southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest totals are likely
to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be too extreme. In
general the forecast remains on track for a significant increase
of coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central
U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best potential for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Wintry weather
will be possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield,
with at least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details with the wintry precipitation in the colder air
may be more dependent on lower-confidence details of ejecting
shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Cold conditions near the East Coast will extend through Sunday
with many areas 10-20F below normal. Subfreezing lows should
extend into portions of Florida and parts of the Florida Peninsula
may challenge daily records for both morning lows and daytime
highs. Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures
Sunday into the first part of next work week, with some
northern/central areas possibly seeing plus 20F or greater
anomalies on one or two days. This warm air will progress into the
eastern half of the country Tuesday-Thursday, bringing a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal and perhaps greater
anomalies for lows over the Northeast by Thursday. Also during
Tuesday-Thursday much of the West and then into the Plains will
see an episode of chilly temperatures with the Rockies and Plains
seeing the best potential for readings 10-20F below normal.

The upper trough/low reaching the Southwest by early Sunday should
produce little if any precipitation over that region. However, as
the feature continues eastward, there will be some potential for
locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern Texas across parts
of the Gulf Coast region during the first half of the week. Best
potential at this time appears to be over eastern Texas with lower
confidence in details farther east. Some aspects of this event may
hinge on small-scale details not easily resolved very far in
advance. The northeastern Pacific upper trough digging into the
West Sunday-Tuesday will spread moderate amounts of rain and
mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest eastward and
southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest totals are likely
to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be too extreme. In
general the forecast remains on track for a significant increase
of coverage and intensity of precipitation over the east-central
U.S. by Wednesday-Thursday as the upper trough emerges from the
Rockies and the leading cold front interacts with a strong low
level feed of Gulf moisture. At this time the best potential for
heaviest rainfall extends across the lower half of the Mississippi
Valley into parts of the Ohio/Tennessee Valleys. Wintry weather
will be possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield,
with at least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details with the wintry precipitation in the colder air
may be more dependent on lower-confidence details of ejecting
shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Cold conditions near the East Coast will extend through Sunday
with many areas 10-20F below normal. Subfreezing lows should
extend into portions of Florida and parts of the Florida Peninsula
may challenge daily records for both morning lows and daytime
highs. Much of the Plains will see above normal temperatures
Sunday into the first part of next work week, with some
northern/central areas possibly seeing plus 20F or greater
anomalies on one or two days. This warm air will progress into the
eastern half of the country Tuesday-Thursday, bringing a broad
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal and perhaps greater
anomalies for lows over the Northeast by Thursday. Also during
Tuesday-Thursday much of the West and then into the Plains will
see an episode of chilly temperatures with the Rockies and Plains
seeing the best potential for readings 10-20F below normal.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
202 AM EST Fri Jan 28 2022

Valid 12Z Mon Jan 31 2022 - 12Z Fri Feb 04 2022

...Overview...

A weak shortwave moving through the southern Plains on Monday
should shear out pretty quickly as it moves out of the Plains
Tuesday-Wednesday due to a building ridge over the western
Atlantic. This shortwave should at least generate enhanced
rainfall along/north of the Gulf Coast on Monday. After this,
another shortwave is forecast to amplify out of the West, sending
an amplified and elongated trough into the central U.S. by
Thursday. By Friday, broad longwave troughing should cover much of
the CONUS as strong ridging builds over the East Pacific and
Western Atlantic. This evolution is expected to bring widespread
precipitation along a leading frontal boundary into the eastern
third of the country mid-late next week, with potential for wintry
weather on the backside of the system.


...Guidance Evaluation/Predictability Assessment...

For the most part, the guidance shows pretty good agreement on the
overall large scale pattern, but plenty of continued uncertainty
in the details. The 27/12z UKMET remained a notable outlier for
the initial shortwave through the Southern Plains/Gulf Coast on
Monday, but the 28/00z run trended a little slower and more in
line with the rest of the guidance. For the next system digging
into the Western/Central U.S. Tuesday-Thursday, the operational
models seem to be trending towards less separation of
northern/southern stream energy compared to previous runs, though
the UKMET again is problematic with maintaining more separation
between streams. For the first half of the period, WPC leaned
towards a non-UKMET deterministic model run consensus.

Larger differences across the board begin to arise during the
second half of the period. First concerning energy lifting towards
the Great Lakes/Northeast where the GFS is noticeably faster than
the ECMWF, which affects deepening low pressure into the Lower
Great Lakes/Northeast on Friday. Out West, uncertainties remain
with strength of upstream energy dropping into the mean trough on
Thursday. The past few runs of the ECMWF have been consistently
much weaker and faster with the energy as it rounds out the base
of the trough by Friday. The GFS had been consistently more
amplified/slower though the 27/18z run looked a lot like the
ECMWF, and the 00z run again a tad more amplified than the
previous run. The CMC is also stronger/slower. A look at
individual ensemble members and the means, suggest a more
amplified solution is possible (more so evident in the GEFS than
the ECENS members). Given the lingering uncertainties both with
the Northeast energy and the Western energy, the WPC forecast for
days 6 and 7 trended towards the means, but continued about 50
percent contribution from the latest available GFS/ECMWF for some
added definition to individual systems.


...Weather Highlights/Threats...

The upper shortwave/low into the Southern Plains by Monday will
bring a threat for locally moderate to heavy rainfall from eastern
Texas across parts of the Gulf Coast region during the first half
of next week. Best potential at this time appears to be over
eastern Texas with lower confidence in details farther east. Some
aspects of this event may hinge on small-scale details not easily
resolved very far in advance. The northeastern Pacific upper
trough digging into the West Monday-Tuesday will spread moderate
amounts of rain and mountain snow from the Pacific Northwest
eastward and southeastward into much of the Rockies. Highest
totals are likely to be in the Pacific Northwest but should not be
too extreme. In general, the forecast remains on track for a
significant increase of coverage and intensity of precipitation
over the east-central U.S. the second half of the week as the
upper trough emerges from the Rockies and the leading cold front
interacts with a strong low level feed of Gulf moisture. At this
time the best chance for heaviest rainfall extends across the
lower half of the Mississippi Valley into parts of the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys and the East. Wintry weather will be
possible on the northwest side of the moisture shield, with at
least some potential for meaningful snow from the
central/south-central Plains northeastward through the Great
Lakes. While confidence in a heavy rain area appears better than
average, details with the wintry precipitation in the colder air
may be more dependent on lower-confidence details of ejecting
shortwave energy and frontal waves.

Above average temperatures initially over the Plains on Monday
should spread eastward Tuesday-Thursday as upper ridging builds
in. Behind this, arctic high pressure dives into the Central U.S.
midweek bringing chilly and much below normal temperatures all the
way from the northern Rockies/High Plains southward into Texas.
Widespread daytime highs (and slightly less extreme overnight
lows) as much as 10-20 degrees below normal are possible. Locally
higher values as much as 25 below normal are possible across the
far northern Plains. The below normal temps should moderate
slightly as they shift east into the Ohio Valley/Gulf Coast states
next Friday. Much of the West Coast states should be near normal
through much of next week owing to amplified ridging across the
East Pacific.

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
50+ kt north-northwesterly flow at 500 mb will overspread the
central Plains states today as a mid-level trough impinges on the
Atlantic Coastline. Surface high pressure across the Plains will
allow for modest downslope westerly surface flow from southwest
South Dakota into the Texas Panhandle through the afternoon hours.
While surface temperatures are expected to be on the cool side (i.e.
struggling to exceed 50F) across the central and southern High
Plains, RH is expected to drop into the 15-25% range by afternoon
peak heating. The latest guidance consensus suggests that patchy
areas of 15+ mph sustained northwesterly surface winds are possible
from the Nebraska to Texas Panhandles this afternoon. However,
overall cooler temperatures and the fragmented nature of the
stronger surface winds preclude Elevated highlights this outlook.

...Powerful winter storm to produce significant impacts across
parts of New England and coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on
Saturday...

...Well below average temperatures will expand across eastern
third of the country this weekend before moderating next week;
Great Plains warm up this weekend...

An area of low pressure is forecast to develop off the Atlantic
coast of Florida this morning. This low will rapidly intensify as
it travels north throughout the day. Moderate to heavy snow and
strong winds are forecast to materialize along the Mid-Atlantic
and Northeast coast this evening as the low arrives off the coast
of North Carolina. Some light to moderate amounts are also likely
to spread into parts of the Southern Appalachians. Heavy snow and
intense winds are then likely to spread into New England on
Saturday as the Nor'easter intensifies even more off the Northeast
coast. Blizzard conditions are expected across portions of coastal
New England, particularly from southeast Maine to Cape Cod which
will make travel nearly impossible. Beach erosion and coastal
flooding will also be a concern. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings
are in effect for much of the coastal Mid-Atlantic up into the
coastal Northeast. Winter Weather Advisories and Warnings are in
effect for parts of the Central/Southern Appalachians. The
heaviest snowfall is likely to fall across a swath extending from
the Eastern Shore of Maryland up through most of Maine where 6-12
inches is expected. Parts of coastal New England where blizzard
conditions are forecast may see between 1-2 feet of snow with
locally higher amounts possible, particularly over coastal
Massachusetts.

Bitter cold air will follow behind the Nor'easter and plunge
temperatures across the eastern third of the country on Saturday
where highs will be 15-25 degrees below average in most places.
The cold snap will come to an end by the start of the work week.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CST Fri Jan 28 2022

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad northwesterly mid-level flow will prevail across the Plains
states as an upper ridge across the Interior West slowly approaches
the Rockies tomorrow/Saturday. An embedded mid-level impulse will
traverse the Central Plains tomorrow, with surface lee-troughing
across the Plains states ushering in dry surface air from the High
Plains. By afternoon peak heating, widespread 15-20 percent RH is
expected to overspread much of the central and southern Plains.
Portions of central Nebraska will be overspread by stronger flow
aloft given the passage of the embedded mid-level impulse,
encouraging relatively widespread 15+ mph sustained westerly winds
coinciding with the lower RH. When also considering the dry fuels
across the central Plains, Elevated highlights have been introduced
for portions of central Nebraska into extreme northern Kansas.

Weaker upper support across the southern Plains should keep surface
winds below 15 mph on a widespread basis from southeast Colorado
into western Texas eastward to central Oklahoma. However, the 15-20
percent RH by afternoon peak heating overspreading dry fuels may
support at least localized fire-spread concerns. Should guidance
depict more widespread stronger winds across the southern Plains,
Elevated highlights may be introduced.

Lastly, 15 mph sustained northwesterly surface winds overlapping
25-35 percent RH may accompany a post-cold frontal environment
across the Florida Peninsula tomorrow afternoon. While such
conditions would typically warrant Elevated highlights, relatively
high fuel moisture/low forecast ERCs suggest that fuel receptiveness
is mediocre, precluding fire weather highlights this outlook.

...Powerful winter storm to produce significant impacts across
parts of New England and coastal Mid-Atlantic/Northeast on
Saturday...

...Well below average temperatures will expand across eastern
third of the country this weekend before moderating next week;
Great Plains warm up this weekend...

An area of low pressure is forecast to develop off the Atlantic
coast of Florida this morning. This low will rapidly intensify as
it travels north throughout the day. Moderate to heavy snow and
gusty winds are forecast to materialize along the Mid-Atlantic and
Northeast coasts this evening as the low arrives off the coast of
North Carolina. Some moderate to heavy amounts are also likely to
spread into parts of the Central and Southern Appalachians. Heavy
snow and intense winds are then expected to develop over New
England on Saturday as the Nor'easter continues to intensify off
the Northeast coast. Blizzard conditions are forecast from eastern
Long Island through much of coastal New England, particularly from
southeast Maine to Cape Cod. This will make travel nearly
impossible. Significant beach erosion and coastal flooding will
also be a concern. Winter Storm Watches and Warnings are in effect
for much of the coastal Mid-Atlantic up into the coastal
Northeast. Winter Weather Advisories and Warnings are in effect
for parts of the Central/Southern Appalachians. The heaviest
snowfall is likely to fall across a swath extending from the
Eastern Shore of Maryland up through most of Maine where 6-12
inches are likely. Parts of coastal New England, where blizzard
conditions are forecast, may see between 1-2 feet of snow with
locally higher amounts possible, specifically over coastal
Massachusetts.

Bitter cold air will filter in behind the Nor'easter and plunge
temperatures across the eastern third of the country on Saturday.
Highs will be 15-25 degrees below average in most places.
Temperatures will begin to moderate across the region by Monday.
Elsewhere, an Alberta clipper system will bring light snow to the
Upper Great Lakes on Saturday night while a new system emerges to
produce light rain and snow over the Pacific Northwest.
Anomalously warm air will expand across the Great Plains this
weekend.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK

No changes to the ongoing forecast.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0113 AM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strengthening mid-level flow is forecast to expand southward across
the Northwest and northern Rockies through the day today as a trough
amplifies over southwest Canada. At the surface, a surface low is
expected to move rapidly east across Canada with a trailing dryline
extending southward into portions of the northern Plains. This
dryline will move rapidly east through the day with dry and breezy
conditions expected in its wake.

...Northern Rockies into the Northern Plains...
A combination of the tightening pressure gradient and a deeply mixed
airmass transporting stronger mid-level flow to the surface should
lead to gusty surface winds across much of the northern Rockies and
northern Plains. A dry airmass should be in place with relative
humidity around 10 to 15 percent across the Great Basin and Wyoming
and 15 to 20 percent across Montana and North Dakota. Therefore,
elevated fire weather concerns are expected across much of this
region this afternoon/early evening.

...Portions of the Columbia Basin...
Strengthening onshore flow is expected today with flow compressed
through the Cascade Gaps. The strongest winds are expected through
the Columbia River Gorge and into the western Columbia Basin. Enough
heating is also expected in this area for relative humidity to drop
below 15 percent. Fuels are starting to dry out in the area (ERC
around 80th percentile) but are only critically dry in localized
areas. However, the winds are strong enough and the relative
humidity is low enough that an elevated fire weather area is
justified.

PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT September 15 2021

SYNOPSIS: A transient mid-level pattern is anticipated for week-2, with a
series of mid-level lows traversing across the lower 48. An initial mid-level
low over the western contiguous U.S. increases the likelihood for much below
normal temperatures. Lingering surface high pressure across parts of northern
mainland Alaska from the end of week-1 into the start of week-2 may support
much below normal temperatures over the region at the beginning of the period.
There is multi-model agreement indicating a strong surface low forming over
the
Bering Sea at the beginning of the period and tracking to the Gulf of Alaska,
which may bring unsettled weather to the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the Great Basin,
Fri-Sat, Sep 24-25.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures for parts of the northern
Mainland of Alaska, Thu, Sep 23.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the South Coast of Alaska and
the Alaska Panhandle, Thu-Sat, Sep 23-25.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR SATURDAY SEPTEMBER 18 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 22:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!vcQMh_4ZVz5BT68MDepowfhNEFHzIYH1hOoIpw0Pq8DfF9E0VqWaA9nZWojFwUxyfBzyFYkB$

FOR THURSDAY SEPTEMBER 23 - WEDNESDAY SEPTEMBER 29: The 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensemble means indicate a series of shortwave troughs propagating
eastward across the CONUS during week-2. An initial mid-level trough is
anticipated to develop across the western CONUS at the beginning of the
period,
which increases chances for much below normal temperatures across parts of the
West. However, given the progressive pattern, there is increased model
uncertainty regarding the timing and location regarding the much below normal
temperature risk. The ECMWF reforecast tool has higher probabilities, greater
spatial coverage, and a longer duration of temperatures reaching these
thresholds compared to the GEFS counterpart. Since this cold signal is
relatively transient in the ECMWF reforecast tool, there is less expectation
that areas would experience these much below normal temperatures for an
extended period. Despite model disparity, a slight risk of much below normal
temperatures is highlighted across parts of the Great Basin, Sep 24 to 25,
where there is agreement between the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools depicting
at least a 20% chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th
percentile and freezing. The highlighted risk area is decreased in spatial
coverage in today's outlook due to much of the predicted cold event timing out
before week-2 and decreased signals for an anomalous cold pattern in many of
the week-2 temperature tools.



The aforementioned series of mid-level troughs could support surface low
formation across the central CONUS and associated frontal activity. No related
heavy precipitation hazards are posted at this time due to the reforecast
tools
not being supportive of a related risk and the expectation that these features
are fairly progressive. As of 2pm EDT, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) is
monitoring two disturbances in the eastern tropical Atlantic, one with a 90%
chance of tropical cyclone formation in the next 5 days and another with a 20%
chance. It is too far out in lead time to determine whether there will be any
related hazardous impacts to the CONUS. Therefore, no hazards related to
tropical disturbances are posted at this time but will be monitored in the
upcoming days.



Across Alaska, there is a potential for surface high pressure to linger across
northern portions of mainland Alaska at the start of the period which could
allow cold arctic air to enter the region. Due to increasing model uncertainty
regarding whether temperatures will reach hazards criteria, in addition to the
greatest likelihood for a widespread cold event occurring prior to week-2, a
slight risk of much below normal temperature is limited to the northern part
of
Alaska for Sep 23. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indicate at least a 20%
chance of minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile and 20
Deg
F.



There is multi-model depiction of a strong storm forming over the Bering Sea
and traversing southwestern Alaska to the Gulf of Alaska at the beginning of
week-2. The orientation of this storm may be favorable to strong onshore flow
from the Gulf of Alaska to the South Coast of Alaska and Alaska Panhandle.
Given good model agreement indicating this storm and the reforecast tools
indicating at least a 20% of 3-day precipitation accumulations exceeding the
85th percentile and 2 inches in the region, a slight risk of heavy
precipitation is posted for parts of the South Coast of Alaska and the Alaska
Panhandle, Sep 23 to 25.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The synoptic pattern during the medium range period will be
amplifying as ridging builds over the east and a trough digs into
the West this weekend and shifts eastward into the central U.S. by
early to middle of next week. There has been a signal for an upper
level low to become closed over the northern High Plains however
there continues to be considerable uncertainty both on timing and
strength. The 06Z GFS was a bit faster than the 00Z run but
overall had similar tracks to the 00Z ECWMF and the CMC. The
preferred model blend was heavier with the 00Z ECWMF and 00/06Z
GFS but also included some of the 00Z CMC initially, with
increasing weighting of the 00Z ECWMF ensemble and GEFS mean. This
help preserve run to run continuity.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A tropical airmass will linger over the Gulf, Gulf states and the
Southeast after Nicholas fizzles out, allowing for additional
light to moderate rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast, in regions
which have already received heavy rainfall. Rainfall will impact
the Eastern U.S. this weekend ahead of a front progressing through
the region, while showers and storms linger over the Southeast for
a couple more days within an area of weakness in the upper levels.
Widespread rain, likely heavy at times, will spread across the
Northwest with some snow possible in the higher elevations. This
moisture and widespread precipitation is expected to shift to the
Intermountain West and far western portions of the High Plains as
the trough amplifies and shifts inland early next week.

The amplified troughing  over the West will allow for cooler
temperatures over the Northwest. The afternoon daily maxes are
forecast to average 10-15F or more below normal beyond this
weekend with gradual expansion into the Northern Rockies as
surface high pressure settles in behind the front. There will also
be a warming trend in temperatures from the Plains to the
Northeast within a building ridge aloft. Warmest anomalies of
possibly +10-20F should shift from the Northern/Central Plains
this weekend and into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
Monday-Tuesday.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0222 PM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

Only minor modifications were made to within northeast Montana.
Fuels are marginal in the region so the elevated area was adjusted
to where winds of 20 mph are most likely.

Fuels across much of Utah are not equally receptive to fire spread.
However, recent dry conditions have allowed local ERC values to rise
to near the 70th percentile. Given the winds and RH expected, the
elevated area remains unchanged.

..Wendt.. 09/15/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021/

...Synopsis...
Strong mid-level flow (> 50 mph) is expected across Idaho, Montana,
and northern Wyoming on Thursday. Farther southwest, flow is
expected to be weaker, but still above 25 mph across the remainder
of the Great Basin and central Rockies.

...Great Basin into northwest Colorado and western Wyoming and the
Snake River Plain...
Deep boundary layer mixing is forecast across much of the Great
Basin and central Rockies on Thursday afternoon. Therefore, surface
winds are expected to increase where there is stronger flow aloft
from southern Nevada across Utah and into western Wyoming. Relative
humidity is expected to be in the 8 to 14 percent range across this
entire region. This deep mixing and stronger surface flow will also
extend into favored areas within the Snake River Plain where
elevated to possibly critical conditions are anticipated.

...Eastern Montana into far Western Colorado...
A surface cold front will usher in a cooler and much more moist
airmass across much of Montana and the northern Plains. However, a
pocket of drier air is forecast to arrive across eastern Montana and
far western North Dakota during peak heating with relative humidity
dropping below 20 percent in some locations. In addition, winds are
expected to be strong across most of this area with widespread
sustained wind speeds above 20 mph. Therefore, some elevated fire
weather conditions are expected Thursday afternoon and evening.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed September 15 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 21 - 25 2021

Today's ensemble mean solutions show good agreement among the models on the
500-hPa flow pattern over North America. A 500-hPa trough is forecast over the
Arctic region and stretches from northern Alaska to the western Aleutians. A
mean trough is favored over much of the north-central CONUS. The 500-hPa
height
blend features positive height anomalies over most of Mainland Alaska and the
Panhandle, with negative height anomalies over the western Aleutians. Near to
above normal heights are favored over the CONUS, with the largest positive
height anomalies forecast across the Northeast.

Troughing favors below-normal temperatures for much of Alaska and the western
CONUS. Predicted 500-hPa ridging over the southwestern CONUS and most of the
eastern CONUS leads to enhanced chances of above-normal temperatures, with the
highest probabilities (exceeding 80%) over the Northeast.

Forecast easterly surface flow increases odds of below-normal precipitation
over parts of northern Mainland Alaska. The forecast trough over the western
Aleutians favors an active storm track and increased onshore flow across parts
of southern Mainland Alaska, the Alaska Panhandle, and portions of the
northwestern CONUS, leading to enhanced odds of above normal precipitation.
Predicted surface high pressure and near to above normal 500-hPa heights
increase the likelihood of near to below-normal precipitation across most of
the western and central CONUS. Ahead of the predicted trough over the
north-central CONUS, several storm systems with trailing frontal boundaries
are
forecast to progress eastward, favoring above-normal precipitation for much of
the eastern half of the U.S. However, below normal precipitation is favored
over parts of the Northeast, underneath forecast above normal 500-hPa heights.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the ensemble models and tools in depicting a relatively
amplified pattern, offset by increasing uncertainty in the position and
strength of the forecast trough.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR SEP 23 - 29 2021

Heading into the Week-2 period, the 500-hPa pattern shows a slight progression
of the 6-10 day mean 500-hPa pattern, though the amplitude of most features is
expected to be lower due to increased uncertainty related to larger ensemble
spread. Due to the pattern being very similar to the 6-10 day period, the
Week-2 temperature forecasts are very similar as well. Precipitation
probability forecasts are very similar to 6-10 day forecasts over Alaska. For
the CONUS, all dynamical forecast tools are in very good agreement and favor
near to below normal precipitation.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, and a persistent pattern across the
domain with good day-to-day consistency, off set by increased uncertainty
among
the forecast tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
September 16.

Northeast and northern Mid-Atlantic through Thursday morning...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Northern High Plains/ Northern Rockies into the Great Basin...

The Tropical Depression Nicholas will slowly dissipate over
Louisiana by Friday evening while producing showers and
thunderstorms.  The system will produce heavy rain over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast through Friday.  Therefore, the WPC has
issued a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms. The associated heavy rain will create numerous
areas of flash flooding. Furthermore, many streams may flood,
potentially affecting larger rivers through Thursday morning. The
excessive rainfall threat will weaken slightly to a Slight Risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Central Gulf Coast on
Thursday into Friday.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northeast southwestward to
the Middle/Lower Mississippi Valley will become quasi-stationary
while the western end dissipates by Thursday afternoon.  The
eastern part of the boundary will weaken on Friday until
dissipating by Friday evening.  Moisture pooling along the front
will aid in producing showers and thunderstorms along and ahead of
the boundary, and some of the storms will become severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Northeast and northern
Mid-Atlantic through Thursday morning.  The hazards associated
with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Furthermore,
the showers and thunderstorms will produce heavy rain.  Therefore,
the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall with these
thunderstorms. The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable through Thursday morning.  The
severe thunderstorm threat weakens along with the excessive
rainfall threat on Thursday.  Showers and thunderstorms will
continue over parts of the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic through Friday
evening.

Meanwhile, a front extending from the Northern High Plains
southwestward to the Great Basin will move eastward to the Great
Lakes by Friday evening.  Showers and thunderstorms will develop
along and ahead of the boundary on Thursday afternoon into
Thursday evening, with some of the storms becoming severe.
Therefore, the SPC has issued a Slight Risk of severe
thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley into the
Northern Plains on Thursday into Friday morning.  The hazards
associated with these thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Another front
will begin to move onshore over the Pacific Northwest on Friday
bring moderate to heavy rain over parts of the Pacific Northwest
starting on Friday.

Furthermore, temperatures will be 10 to 15 degrees above average
over parts of the Northern High Plains and Northern Rockies.  A
front moving over the area will aid in producing gusty winds and
with dry conditions in place, there is an Elevated Risk of fire
weather over parts of the Northern High Plains/Northern Rockies
into the Great Basin through Thursday morning. Therefore, Red Flag
Warnings are issued over the area due to high temperatures, low
moisture content, and gusty winds.

...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

The synoptic pattern during the medium range period will be
amplifying as ridging builds over the east and a trough digs into
the West this weekend and shifts eastward into the central U.S. by
early to middle of next week. There has been a signal for an upper
level low to become closed over the northern High Plains however
there continues to be considerable uncertainty both on timing and
strength. The 06Z GFS was a bit faster than the 00Z run but
overall had similar tracks to the 00Z ECWMF and the CMC. The
preferred model blend was heavier with the 00Z ECWMF and 00/06Z
GFS but also included some of the 00Z CMC initially, with
increasing weighting of the 00Z ECWMF ensemble and GEFS mean. This
help preserve run to run continuity.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

A tropical airmass will linger over the Gulf, Gulf states and the
Southeast after Nicholas fizzles out, allowing for additional
light to moderate rainfall to parts of the Gulf Coast, in regions
which have already received heavy rainfall. Rainfall will impact
the Eastern U.S. this weekend ahead of a front progressing through
the region, while showers and storms linger over the Southeast for
a couple more days within an area of weakness in the upper levels.
Widespread rain, likely heavy at times, will spread across the
Northwest with some snow possible in the higher elevations. This
moisture and widespread precipitation is expected to shift to the
Intermountain West and far western portions of the High Plains as
the trough amplifies and shifts inland early next week.

The amplified troughing  over the West will allow for cooler
temperatures over the Northwest. The afternoon daily maxes are
forecast to average 10-15F or more below normal beyond this
weekend with gradual expansion into the Northern Rockies as
surface high pressure settles in behind the front. There will also
be a warming trend in temperatures from the Plains to the
Northeast within a building ridge aloft. Warmest anomalies of
possibly +10-20F should shift from the Northern/Central Plains
this weekend and into the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
Monday-Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1148 PM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
A positively tilted mid-level shortwave trough will traverse the
northern Rockies through the day today. Along its southern
periphery, strong mid-level flow (>50 mph) will overspread much of
the northern Rockies and Northern Plains as well as the northern
Great Basin. At the surface, a surface low is forecast to move east
across South Dakota. In addition, a strong cold front will move
southeast across eastern Montana.

...Eastern Montana into far northwest North Dakota...
In the wake of the surface cold front, dry air and at least some
surface heating is expected to allow the relative humidity to drop
into the 20s in portions of eastern Montana and far northwest North
Dakota. Meanwhile, strong northwest surface winds of 20 to 25 mph
are expected across this same region during the afternoon hour.

...Snake River Plain...
A well-mixed boundary layer is expected across the Great Basin this
afternoon. Some stronger winds are expected to mix to the surface in
the Snake River Plain where mid-level flow will be parallel to the
river valley and where stronger winds aloft are expected.

...Southern Nevada across Utah and into southern Wyoming and
northwest Colorado...
A well-mixed boundary layer is expected across much of the Great
Basin this afternoon. Slightly stronger mid-level flow (~25 mph) is
expected in a region from the southern Great Basin into the northern
Rockies. Given the deep mixing that is expected, some of this
stronger flow is expected to reach the surface with 15 to 20 mph
surface winds forecast across a broad portion of the southern Great
Basin and central Rockies.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1150 PM CDT Wed Sep 15 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
On Friday, a strong mid-level jet streak is expected to move toward
the Pacific Northwest as a strong mid-level trough approaches the
coast. Meanwhile, weak ridging is expected to amplify across
portions of the Southwest. This will increase mid-level flow through
the day across much of the western CONUS. Meanwhile, an area of
surface high pressure is expected to settle into the central Plains
with cyclogenesis in the lee of the Canadian Rockies. This will
tighten the surface pressure gradient, especially across the
central/northern Rockies and the northern Plains. Significant
surface heating, and deep boundary-layer heating is forecast across
much of the western CONUS on Friday. Therefore, a large area is
expected to see increasing surface winds during the afternoon, as
the mid-level flow strengthens and some flow is transported to the
surface in the well-mixed environment. The strongest surface winds
are expected across portions of the northern Plains, where the
surface pressure gradient is also contributing to the increasing
surface winds.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
215 AM EDT Thu Sep 16 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Sep 19 2021 - 12Z Thu Sep 23 2021


...Overview and Guidance Evaluation/Preferences...

Upper level ridging is forecast to remain in place across the
Southeast and East Coast during the medium range period while a
strong/amplified trough progresses through the Pacific Northwest
toward northern Plains. This scenario is well agreed on by the
latest deterministic and ensemble guidance through about day 5. As
the trough pushes into the Plains, low pressure is forecast to
develop and lift toward the Great Lakes region. Aside from the 12Z
ECMWF, most of the models show a flattening trough and therefore a
more progressive system. Meanwhile the ECMWF advertised a slower
trough that eventually cuts off over the Plains. For this cycle,
the blend consisted of near equal weights for day 3-5 then a
higher use of the ensemble means for day 6 and 7 to account for
some of the uncertainty in the northern Plains and Great Lakes.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, high pressure is forecast to be the
dominant feature for the East Coast through the middle of next
week.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ahead of the approaching trough and associated deepening low
pressure system for the Intermountain West and northern Plains by
early next week, warm and moist air will surge north from the
Gulf. This will lead to above average high temperatures and daily
chances of scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms, some
of which could be locally heavy along the Gulf Coast region where
the airmass will be very tropical in nature. The greatest
temperature departures from normal will be for the northern tier
and Upper Midwest where daily highs 10F to 20F above normal will
be possible. As the upper level trough digs and advances over the
northwest and northern tier, expect much below normal high
temperatures in its wake. Maximum temperatures of 10F to as much
as 20F below normal will be possible Sunday and Monday across the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West. Meanwhile, lows across
the CONUS are largely forecast to be above normal, with some
significant departures from normal likely Sunday into early next
week across the northern tier and Great Lakes. Lows 15F to 20F
above normal are possible.

more progressive system. Meanwhile the ECMWF advertised a slower
trough that eventually cuts off over the Plains. For this cycle,
the blend consisted of near equal weights for day 3-5 then a
higher use of the ensemble means for day 6 and 7 to account for
some of the uncertainty in the northern Plains and Great Lakes.
Elsewhere across the CONUS, high pressure is forecast to be the
dominant feature for the East Coast through the middle of next
week.


...Weather/Hazard Highlights...

Ahead of the approaching trough and associated deepening low
pressure system for the Intermountain West and northern Plains by
early next week, warm and moist air will surge north from the
Gulf. This will lead to above average high temperatures and daily
chances of scattered to numerous showers and thunderstorms, some
of which could be locally heavy along the Gulf Coast region where
the airmass will be very tropical in nature. The greatest
temperature departures from normal will be for the northern tier
and Upper Midwest where daily highs 10F to 20F above normal will
be possible. As the upper level trough digs and advances over the
northwest and northern tier, expect much below normal high
temperatures in its wake. Maximum temperatures of 10F to as much
as 20F below normal will be possible Sunday and Monday across the
Pacific Northwest and Intermountain West. Meanwhile, lows across
the CONUS are largely forecast to be above normal, with some
significant departures from normal likely Sunday into early next
week across the northern tier and Great Lakes. Lows 15F to 20F
above normal are possible.

...Tropical Depression Nicholas is forecast to slowly dissipate as
a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall remains in effect over parts
of the Central Gulf Coast this morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
central Gulf coast through Saturday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Mississippi Valley and Northern Plains today...

...There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the
Northern Plains, Rockies and into the Great Basin...

Tropical Depression Nicholas will weaken considerably today as it
slowly moves northward across central Louisiana. Nicholas will
eventually dissipate tonight, but will continue to pose flash
flooding threats to the central Gulf coast into the weekend. A
Slight Risk of excessive rainfall leading to flash flooding is in
effect for parts of the central Gulf coast through Friday as
Nicholas continues to pull a substantial amount of tropical
moisture into the region, where multiple inches of rain are
expected. Scattered to isolated thunderstorms are also possible
across much of the Southeast and East Coast through Saturday
morning.

Meanwhile, a cold front will bring thunderstorm activity to the
Northern/Central Plains and the Upper Mississippi Valley through
Friday evening. A Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms is in effect
for those areas today. Thunderstorm activity is forecast to spread
into the Lower Great Lakes region Friday evening.

A Pacific low pressure system will begin impacting the Pacific
Northwest on Friday morning and continue doing so through the
weekend. Several inches of rain are forecast to fall, particularly
over higher elevations. This system will move into the Rockies by
Sunday, but surface troughing on its backside will continue to
generate rainfall over the Northwest. Freeze warnings and frost
advisories are in effect from northeastern Washington to
northwestern Montana as a cooler Pacific airmass rolls in behind
the cold front. Highs over much of the Northwest will be in the
low to mid 60s which is between 15-20 degrees below average for
this time of year. Temperatures will warm up considerably over the
Northern Plains on Saturday as an upper-level ridge settles over
the region. Highs are likely to be in the upper 80s into the low
90s which is between 15-20 degrees above average for this time of
year. There is an Elevated Risk of fire weather for parts of the
Northern Plains, Rockies and Great Basin through Friday due to the
warm temperatures and higher winds.

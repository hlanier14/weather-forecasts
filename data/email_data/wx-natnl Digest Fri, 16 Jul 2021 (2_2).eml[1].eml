...Hot temperatures from the northern Great Basin to the northern
Rockies/northern Plains...

...Overview...

A strong upper high anchored over or near southern Wyoming will
dominate the pattern next week.  This high will support well above
normal temperatures from the northern Great Basin through the
northern Plains and to some degree into the Upper Midwest, while
downstream upper troughing will bring a series of fronts into the
East along with near to moderately below normal temperatures.
Some energy within the western side of the trough could form an
upper low that reaches the southern Plains/Rockies by mid-late
week before weakening--resulting in some locally enhanced rainfall
and below average high temperatures.  An upper low off the coast
of British Columbia/Haida Gwaii should eject into western Canada
during the latter half of the week, with the trough to its south
possibly lowering heights over the Northwest slightly.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The relative agreement and continuity of models/ensembles for the
overall pattern would suggest better than average predictability
but of course confidence is lower for specifics of smaller-scale
shortwaves.  For the updated forecast based on 12Z/18Z guidance,
an operational model composite early followed by a trend toward a
model/model ensemble mean blend represented the most common ideas
of guidance while representing an intermediate approach where
differences existed.  The 12Z CMC strayed east of consensus with
the Rockies upper ridge for the latter half of the period so the
forecast phased out its already minimal weight at that time.
Toward the end of week solutions diverge for how much troughing
remains off the West Coast depending on the details of upstream
flow.  The GFS/GEFS runs through the new 00Z cycle maintain a
deeper trough while the 12Z ECMWF mean is noticeably weaker and
the 12Z ECMWF even develops a shortwave ridge.  The 12Z CMC mean
is conveniently between the extremes.  This difference has
persisted for multiple runs so an average of these scenarios
appears best for now.  Within the eastern mean trough, latest GFS
runs could be a bit fast with leading energy over the Northeast as
of early Monday.  By day 7 Friday the 00Z CMC trended toward
latest GFS runs and the 12Z ECMWF for what may be the strongest
energy of the period to reach southeastern Canada and the
northeastern U.S.  However the new 00Z ECMWF keeps the feature
farther north.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The potent upper ridge likely to be centered near southern Wyoming
for much of next week will sustain very warm to hot temperatures
from the northern Great Basin through the northern Rockies/Plains
with highs in the 90s up to at least lower 100s at lower
elevations, which are 10-20 degrees above normal.  Such readings
may approach or exceed daily records especially early in the week.
In less extreme fashion some of this heat will extend eastward
into Minnesota and Wisconsin.  On the other hand daytime highs in
the Southern Tier/Southwest will be somewhat below normal (by up
to 5-10F on one or more days) due to increased cloud cover and
higher rainfall chances.  The combination of a wavy front and
possible upper low reaching the southern Plains and vicinity could
produce some areas of locally heavy rainfall.  Monsoon activity
over Arizona and some neighboring areas should continue, with an
increase in rainfall amounts possible late in the week depending
on how far southern Plains moisture and upper level energy
retrograde.

A leading wavy and slow-moving front will extend from near the New
England coast through the Mid-Atlantic into the South early in the
week, accompanied by scattered to numerous showers and
thunderstorms with locally heavier amounts where thunderstorms
locally train.  Additional fronts should reach the Great
Lakes/Northeast around Tuesday-Wednesday and then Thursday-Friday.
 In both cases lower-predictability shortwave specifics and
frontal waves will play a role in the existence/placement of any
locally heavier rainfall.  The mean trough aloft and series of
fronts will keep temperatures over the East near to somewhat below
normal next week.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 AM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021

Valid 161200Z - 171200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad upper ridging will prevail across the Rockies as a mid-level
trough impinges on the Pacific Northwest. Surface troughing across
the Great Basin will encourage some dry and breezy conditions
supporting wildfire-spread potential. Meanwhile, modest mid-level
moisture along the periphery of the upper-ridge is expected to
support isolated thunderstorms across portions of the northern
Rockies, a few of which may be dry.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin...
Surface lee-troughing will encourage dry downslope flow along the
lee of the Cascades and Sierra this afternoon. By peak
boundary-layer mixing/heating, RH is expected to dip into the 15-20%
range, as suggested by the latest guidance consensus. Widespread 15+
mph sustained westerly winds will be most likely across portions of
northern Nevada, where Elevated highlights have been introduced.
While overall weaker wind fields are expected, at least locally
Elevated conditions are expected across the Columbia and Harney
Basins in eastern Washington/Oregon, as well as central into
southern Nevada. Elevated highlights may be needed in the Day 1
update should guidance trend windier across portions of the southern
Great Basin or Pacific Northwest.

...Portions of the northern Rockies into the Great Basin...
At least isolated to potentially scattered thunderstorms are
expected to initiate by early afternoon along the periphery of the
upper ridge, from the Great Basin into the Northern Rockies. Modest
upper flow through a deeper layer is expected to foster relatively
faster storm motions across portions of Idaho into Montana compared
to areas farther south, with a relatively higher concentration of
dry strikes/strike ignitions likely given the aforementioned storm
speeds, deep/dry boundary layer, 0.50-0.75 precipitable water
values, and the presence of near-critical to critically dry fuels.
Portions of the northern Rockies will need to be considered for a
scattered dry thunderstorm delineation in the Day 1 update. Portions
of the Great Basin will experience slower storm motions overall and
a higher ratio of wet strikes. Nonetheless, high-based storms
developing atop a deep, dry boundary layer and critically receptive
fuels warranted the introduction of isolated dry thunderstorm
highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0240 AM CDT Fri Jul 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will continue to amplify across the Interior West as
mid-level troughing persists across the Pacific Northwest through
tomorrow. Surface troughing across portions of the Great Basin into
the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies will encourage at least
locally dry and breezy surface conditions in spots. Isolated
thunderstorms (some potentially dry) are also likely along the upper
ridge axis across parts of the northern Rockies.

...Portions of the Pacific Northwest into the Great Basin...
Dry downslope flow is expected along the lee of the Cascades and
Sierra as surface troughing prevails tomorrow afternoon across the
Great Basin. Latest guidance consensus suggests that 15 mph
sustained westerly surface winds will overlap 15-20% RH for several
hours tomorrow to the lee of the northern Sierra, into the Harney
and northern Great Basins, warranting the introduction of Elevated
highlights.

...Portions of the Northern Rockies...
The latest guidance consensus depicts the greatest chance of
high-based thunderstorms supporting dry strikes along the northern
periphery of the upper ridge across portions of eastern Idaho into
southern Montana and northwest Wyoming. While storm motions will be
modest, the deep sub-cloud layer and presence of very receptive
fuels suggest that at least a few dry strikes will occur, with an
appreciable chance of ignitions given the aforementioned receptive
fuels. An isolated dry thunderstorm area has been introduced to
account for this scenario.

...Showers and thunderstorms to produce the threat of flash
flooding between the Lower Great Lakes and Southern Plains today
before entering the Northeast on Saturday...

...Additional rounds of heavy rain and thunderstorms found
throughout the Southwest...

...Excessive heat builds into the Northern Plains and
Intermountain West this weekend...

The focus for much of the thunderstorm activity east of the
Rockies over the next few days will be associated with a
slow-moving cold front currently located between the Lower Great
Lakes and Southern Plains. The main hazard along this frontal
boundary is expected to be in the form of heavy rain as
thunderstorms develop within a warm and very moist airmass. A
Slight Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued
through Saturday morning to include parts of the Lower Great
Lakes, Ohio Valley, Middle Mississippi Valley, and Southern
Plains. Flash Flood Watches are also in effect across southeast
Kansas, northeast Oklahoma, and southwest Missouri. A few isolated
thunderstorms may turn severe and produce damaging wind gusts. By
Saturday, the aforementioned frontal boundary is forecast to enter
waterlogged portions of the Northeast and stall over southern New
England. This will help spark numerous showers and thunderstorms,
which may pass over locations currently experiencing an extremely
wet July. In fact, much of New England and parts of the Northeast
have seen 5-10+ inches of rain so far this month, more than double
the normal rainfall for the first half of July. Thus, any
additional heavy rain will likely lead to increased runoff and the
potential for flash flooding.

Rain will also continue to make headlines across the Southwest as
monsoonal moisture brings much needed rainfall to this section of
the country. However, instances of flash flooding will remain a
concern throughout parts of Arizona and New Mexico into the
weekend. Additional isolated rainfall totals up to 1 inch are
possible today across central and southeastern Arizona, where
Flash Flood Watches have been issued to highlight the potential
hazard.

Elsewhere, the next heat wave of the summer is set to impact the
Northern Plains and eventually parts of the Great Basin by the end
of the weekend. The pattern behind the upcoming stretch of
oppressive heat is associated with a strong upper-level ridge that
is forecast to strengthen and situate over the Rockies. High
temperatures into the triple digits are likely for several
consecutive days throughout eastern Montana, extending into the
lower elevations of the Northern Rockies and Great Basin by
Sunday. A few daily high temperature records could fall. Highs
into the low-to-mid 90s are forecast along the U.S.-Canada border
through North Dakota and Minnesota as well. Additionally, elevated
fire weather will continue to be a concern throughout much of the
Intermountain West due to the combination of above average
temperatures and extreme drought.

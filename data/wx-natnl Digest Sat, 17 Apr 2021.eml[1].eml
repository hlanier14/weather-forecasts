Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1044 AM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021

Valid 161700Z - 171200Z

...Northwest...
This portion of the forecast remains on track. Per NWCC fuels
information, ERCs in parts of the region are at record levels for
this time of year. As has been alluded to previously, the main
concern will be lower-elevation, finer fuels. Given the observed SLE
sounding this morning, mixing to roughly 800 mb seems like a given
this afternoon. Coupled with a strengthening offshore gradient,
elevated to locally critical conditions are likely today as winds
increase to 15-20 mph. Terrain-enhnaced areas with higher speeds are
probable along with 20+ mph gust potential. The Columbia Gorge
vicinity would be the favored zone for locally critical risk.

...West Texas/Southwest...
With the rapid progression of the cold front into the Permian Basin,
the window for elevated fire weather concerns is generally
narrowing. The greatest potential for locally elevated concerns is
likely within the Trans-Pecos/Big Big near the Rio Grande. However,
uncertainty is high in the overall duration.

Into the Southwest, morning observed soundings show a very dry
low-level airmass. While RH could reach the single digits in some
places, the degree of efficient momentum transfer to the surface is
in question given mid/upper-level clouds. These clouds are expected
to remain over the region most of the day with an upstream shortwave
trough approaching from near the Baja Peninsula. This will impact
the region during peak heating. It is possible that mid-level
convection with this feature will produce areas of virga that could
locally increase RH values. Lastly, with mid-level winds decreasing
with time, even areas that remain relatively cloud free may not see
a significant increase in surface winds. Locally elevated conditions
will remain possible, however.

..Wendt.. 04/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
Moderate to strong mid-level flow is expected across the Southwest
as a mid-level shortwave trough shifts eastward. At the surface,
high pressure will build into the northern Rockies which will bring
dry and cool weather to much of the region and offshore flow to
California, Oregon, and Washington.

...Southwest...
Deep mixing is expected this afternoon as temperatures warm into the
upper 60s to mid 70s across southern Arizona and New Mexico into Far
West Texas. This deep mixing will bring strong winds to the surface
and result in 15 to 20 mph sustained winds despite a relaxed surface
pressure gradient. Relative humidity is expected to range from 8 to
13 percent.

...Portions of the Northwest...
Offshore flow is expected across Oregon and Washington through the
day today. This continental airmass will bring relative humidity of
15 to 20 percent to areas east of the Cascades and in the 20 to 25
percent in some areas west of the Cascades. Fuels in the higher
elevations are mostly still moist and in some places snow covered,
but the finer fuels at lower elevation are mostly cured after
limited precipitation for the past several weeks. Upper-level
support gives additional concern for a large fire threat as both
850mb and 500mb flow are forecast to be 40 to 50 mph and forecast
soundings show mixing to at least 850 mb. Thus, despite forecast
winds of 13 to 15 mph west of the Cascades from most forecast
guidance, would not be surprised to see sustained winds approaching
20 mph with higher gusts.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT April 16 2021

SYNOPSIS: The beginning of the forecast period is anticipated to be marked by
mid-level low pressure located over the northeastern Pacific and Central North
America, with mid-level high pressure over California. This pattern looks to
evolve with the mid-level high building northeastward with time, helping to
push any troughing east of the Rockies northward into Canada. However, prior
to
this, a cold front tied to a surface cyclone downstream of the mid-level low
pressure may bring heavy rain potential to portions of the southeastern U.S.
Mid-level high pressure is forecast over the Bering Sea, likely to result in
above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation across Alaska during
Week-2.

HAZARDS

Slight risk of heavy rain for portions of the Southeast, Southern
Appalachians,
and Mid-Atlantic, Sat, Apr 24.

https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!q18NlKvXBAVujX8PwRAedzSLRjQdzFdCclGiOxfHsiwTRMAJgpfRAMxlhPMRkcT9BrUEtXaD$

FOR SATURDAY APRIL 24 - FRIDAY APRIL 30: The lone hazard today constitutes a
slight risk for heavy rainfall stretching from the Central Gulf Coast
northeastward through the Southern Appalachians and portions of the Piedmont
through North Carolina on April 24th. This region corresponds to having at
least a 20% chance of an inch of rain falling during that date as a cold front
advances east from the Mississippi Valley. The highlighted region is generally
near climatological values in terms of observed soil moisture with no
noteworthy rainfall anomalies anticipated here during Week-1 to increase
vulnerability. Nevertheless, flooding remains possible with any heavy rain
threat. Interested parties are reminded to never drive into flood water of
unknown depth, and that potentially life-saving flood safety guidance from the
National Weather Service is available at:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.weather.gov/safety/flood__;!!DZ3fjg!q18NlKvXBAVujX8PwRAedzSLRjQdzFdCclGiOxfHsiwTRMAJgpfRAMxlhPMRkcT9Bo4-w4qI$ .



Numerous marginal hazards were considered for inclusion in the forecast but
omitted. First, below-normal temperatures continue to be anticipated across
the
Central and Eastern U.S. during the first half of Week-2. This is tied to
surface high pressure sourced from Canada on the back side of the cold front
that could bring heavy rain to the southeastern CONUS. Despite this, frost and
freeze risks are fairly close to climatological values, while actual minimum
temperatures are predominantly only in the 30s and 40s. Second, models
continue
to advertise some degree of anomalous 500-hPa troughing over the northeastern
Pacific during Week-2, with the potential for at least one atmospheric river
event. However, both raw and calibrated forecast guidance indicates negligible
widespread chances of an inch of precipitation falling during 24 hours. Third,
above-normal temperatures are forecast for most areas west of the Rockies
during Week-2, although daytime highs are likely to only range from the
mid-70s
(lower elevations in the Northern Great Basin) to mid-90s (Desert Southwest),
none of which constitute a hazard. GEFS guidance also maintains a signal for
excessive heat (heat index values of 105+ degrees F) across portions of South
Texas during Week-2, but ECMWF guidance continues to omit any such heat
concerns.



Relatively warm and dry conditions continue to be favored across Alaska during
Week-2. While the above-normal temperatures are likely to accelerate melting
snow and ice across the state, the relatively dry conditions should at least
limit additional water being added to the hydrological system during river
break up season.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0146 PM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

As was the case today, a backdoor cold front will be situated in New
central/western New Mexico and make some westward progress. The
general consensus is that this front will be roughly placed along
the Arizona/New Mexico border. Aloft, mid-level winds will be
similar, if not a touch weaker, than they were today as the
elongated trough sags southward. Skies are likely to remain clear
with RH quite low. With the frontal trough to the east and weak
thermal pressure trough to the west, the surface pressure pattern
will not be overly strong. Despite very deep mixing, winds up to 500
mb will be relatively weak. With that in mind, winds seem likely to
range from 10-15 mph. Locally higher speeds are possible,
particularly late in the afternoon with 850-700 mb winds show a
slight increase. With little confidence those conditions will be
sustained more than 3 hours, the fire weather threat will remain
locally elevated in southeastern Arizona.

..Wendt.. 04/16/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0141 AM CDT Fri Apr 16 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Saturday, some dry and breezy conditions will be possible from
the Great Basin into the Southwest. However, the strongest winds and
the driest fuels states will be in southeast Arizona where stronger
mid-level flow will be present and deep mixing may bring some of
these winds to the surface. Surface winds of 15 to 20 mph with
relative humidity of 8 to 15 percent is expected and thus an
elevated area is warranted.

Elsewhere, cool/moist conditions are expected with an overall low
fire weather threat.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

19Z Update:  There was good overall consensus among the guidance
for this forecast cycle.  Given some differences noted with the
ECMWF over the Northeast U.S., in particular regarding the
stronger upper level low around next Wednesday that was depicted
in the 00Z run, it was given slightly less weighting in the
forecast blend and slightly more of the CMC and GFS.  The UKMET
was among the most amplified with a western U.S. shortwave for
early-mid next week when compared to the ensemble plots, so it was
not favored as much for that reason.  The use of the ensemble
means was gradually increased for the Wednesday through Friday
time period to account for the increasing model spread by the end
of the week.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below
for reference. /Hamrick


...Overview...

Strong upper ridging over northwestern Canada (500mb height
anomalies around +3.5 sigma) as well as over the Bermuda Triangle
will favor renewed troughing over the central CONUS next week and
at times in the Northeast and Southwest via split flow. This will
bring cooler than normal temperatures to most of the lower 48 and
push most of the precipitation chances to the south; namely,
Florida. There, a wavy stationary boundary will promote periodic
rainfall which may be heavy at times.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

With the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles in relatively good agreement,
favored the deterministic models that fell within their overlap
the best during the period. This was mostly near the 18Z GFS and
next nearest to the 12Z ECMWF. Uncertainty in the northern stream
flow out of Canada later next week as well as the breakdown of the
upper ridge in the Pacific led to large differences in the upper
pattern over much of the CONUS and, as such, utilized a mostly
ensemble mean blend to mitigate future large changes. Ensemble
trends were toward stronger closed centers in the higher latitudes
suggesting punctuated zonal flow to its south (over the CONUS) and
limited predictability.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
will be the focus for several rounds of potentially heavy rainfall
as the parallel upper flow from the southwest bring in episodes of
moisture and rainfall. The greatest risk will be over northern and
central Florida where several inches are likely in some areas
during the period. ECMWF EPS EFI highlights the area along and
north of I-4 for anomalous rainfall early in the week, then
sinking southward. This may be a significant multi-day event
leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the central
Rockies/western High Plains could see modest snow on Monday as a
cold front stalls in the area, yielding upslope snow potential.
Temperatures will be much colder than normal early in the week
with sub-freezing highs (15-30 degrees below normal). The cold
airmass will spill onto the southern Plains Tuesday where highs
may only reach the mid 50s over northern TX into OK, which may
challenge record cold highs.

Farther west, warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the
West Coast underneath ridging, though that may be tempered a bit
as a Pacific frontal system digs southward over the region.
Precipitation should be minimal and mainly over the mountains. The
East will see a couple chances of light rain and maybe some wet
snow in far northern areas, with temperatures near to slightly
below normal.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri April 16 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 22 - 26 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa height
pattern across North America during the 6-10 day period. Dynamical models
forecast a split flow across the eastern North Pacific with ridging and
positive height anomalies favored across most of Alaska, and a closed 500-hPa
low to the south of the state along with associated troughing in the East
Pacific. This feature is forecast to track closer to the West Coast of the
CONUS during the period, displacing the weak ridging initially favored across
the West. As a result, mid-level heights are favored to trend downward along
the Pacific coast throughout the period, with near normal heights favored for
the period as a whole for most parts of the West. The exception is over parts
of the Great Basin where the lingering influence of ridging results in a tilt
toward positive height anomalies. Negative height anomalies are favored across
much of the central and eastern CONUS as a result of broad troughing
associated
with a mean height anomaly center of -180 meters across Hudson Bay. Near
normal
heights are forecast across the Gulf of Mexico coast, further displaced from
the aforementioned trough.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across much of Alaska,
associated with above normal heights and consistent with both the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools. Initial ridging and increasing southerly mid-level
flow
ahead of the incoming rough over the East Pacific favors above normal
temperatures across the western CONUS, also supported by the reforecast
guidance. Downstream over the central and eastern CONUS, mean troughing favors
increased probabilities for below normal temperatures across most areas. Above
normal temperatures are forecast over the southern Florida Peninsula,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

The split flow pattern across the eastern North Pacific favors a generally dry
pattern across Alaska, with the mean storm track displaced to the south of the
state. Probabilities for above normal precipitation are increased along the
West Coast as the East Pacific troughing shifts closer to the region.
Increased
probabilities for below normal precipitation are forecast across much of the
interior western and central CONUS on the backside of the troughing and
underneath weak ridging. Surface high pressure is favored to move into the
western Atlantic early in the period setting up southerly return flow across
parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Depending on the
orientation of the troughing over the central and eastern CONUS, some of this
moisture may be entrained northward, with the ECMWF ensemble more robust with
several members depicting surface low pressure developing along the Atlantic
Coast. However, the GEFS is considerably drier, with increased westerly
mid-level flow favoring the greatest precipitation chances closer to the Gulf
of Mexico Coast. Todays forecast is a compromise between the two solutions,
favoring increased near to above normal precipitation probabilities over much
of the East, with the highest chances for above normal precipitation along the
Gulf Coast.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 24 - 30 2021

During week-2, the split flow 500-hPa pattern across the Pacific is forecast
to
weaken with the mid-level flow forecast to become more zonal. Positive height
anomalies remain favored for much of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, with
near to below normal heights forecast for parts of the eastern Mainland and
the
Panhandle. Lingering weak mid-level troughing in the East Pacific favors near
normal heights across portions of the West Coast of the CONUS and the Pacific
Northwest. Across the remainder of the CONUS, the mid-level pattern is
forecast
to be weakly amplified with ridging and positive height anomalies over the
west-central CONUS and troughing downstream over the eastern half of the
CONUS,
associated with below normal heights.

Probabilities of above normal temperatures are enhanced across most of Alaska,
supported by the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools, despite decreasing heights
across eastern Alaska relative to the 6-10 day period. Ridging favors above
normal temperatures across much of the western half of the CONUS. Elevated
chances of near to below normal temperatures are forecast across most of the
remainder of the CONUS associated with mean troughing, with the exception of
South Florida where above normal temperature probabilities are increased due
to
less influence from the troughing to the north. This temperature evolution
across the CONUS is consistent with the forecast MJO propagation from phase 7
to 8 toward the end of the period, which would favor a warming trend across
the
west-central CONUS and cooler conditions in the East.

There are elevated chances of below normal precipitation across Alaska due to
the mean storm track remaining displaced to the south. Enhanced onshore flow
is
favored across the West Coast of the CONUS into the Pacific Northwest,
increasing above normal precipitation probabilities in those areas. Slightly
anomalous ridging across the west-central CONUS elevates chances of near to
below normal precipitation from the Rockies eastward through the Great Plains
and Mississippi Valley. Above normal precipitation is favored for the eastern
Seaboard due to the continued threat for frontal activity and shortwave
disturbances propagating along the eastern side of the mean trough axis,
although there remains differences in the models, with the ECMWF ensemble
depicting a wetter solution further north compared to the GEFS, as in the 6-10
day period.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 30% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 50% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to good
agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS as the pattern becomes less amplified.

FORECASTER: Thomas Collow

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
May
20.

...Snow over the High Plains gradually tapers off overnight
Friday; heavy snow over the higher elevations of the Northeast
taper off also overnight Friday...

...There is a Moderate Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
the Central Gulf Coast through Saturday morning...

...Elevated Risk of fire weather over parts of the Northwest...

An upper-level low over Great Basin will slowly sink southward
into Northwest Mexico by Sunday afternoon.   Snow associated with
the upper-level low over parts of the Northern/Central Rockies and
Northern/Central High Plains will slowly taper off overnight
Friday. Some of the energy associated with the upper-level low
will break off over the Central Rockies and move eastward off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast by Sunday morning.  The energy will develop
rain over parts of the Central Plains/Middle Mississippi Valley
through Saturday afternoon.

Meanwhile, a front near the Gulf Coast and moisture pooling along
the boundary will produce showers and thunderstorms with heavy
rain through Saturday morning.  The WPC has issued a Moderate Risk
of excessive rainfall over the Central Gulf Coast through Saturday
morning.  The heavy rain over the Gulf Coast will produce numerous
areas of flash flooding; many streams may flood, potentially
affecting larger rivers.

The rain will move into parts of the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on
Saturday and the Southeast by Saturday evening.  The showers and
thunderstorms will be confined to the coastal regions along the
Gulf Coast on Saturday and mainly over Florida on Sunday.  The
rain will redevelop over parts of the Middle Mississippi Valley
into the Ohio Valley and Central Appalachians on Sunday.

A second upper-level low over the Northeast will slowly move
eastward out over the Western Atlantic by Sunday.  The heavy snow
over the Northeast will gradually taper off overnight Friday.
Scattered rain showers and isolated higher elevation snow showers
will continue over spots through Sunday morning.  Diurnal heating
will help produce rain showers over parts of the Northeast on
Sunday.

Furthermore, gusty winds over parts of the Pacific Northwest will
contribute to an Elevated Risk of fire weather over the region
through Saturday morning.

...Multi-day Heavy Rainfall Threat for Florida...

19Z Update:  There was good overall consensus among the guidance
for this forecast cycle.  Given some differences noted with the
ECMWF over the Northeast U.S., in particular regarding the
stronger upper level low around next Wednesday that was depicted
in the 00Z run, it was given slightly less weighting in the
forecast blend and slightly more of the CMC and GFS.  The UKMET
was among the most amplified with a western U.S. shortwave for
early-mid next week when compared to the ensemble plots, so it was
not favored as much for that reason.  The use of the ensemble
means was gradually increased for the Wednesday through Friday
time period to account for the increasing model spread by the end
of the week.  The previous forecast discussion is appended below
for reference. /Hamrick


...Overview...

Strong upper ridging over northwestern Canada (500mb height
anomalies around +3.5 sigma) as well as over the Bermuda Triangle
will favor renewed troughing over the central CONUS next week and
at times in the Northeast and Southwest via split flow. This will
bring cooler than normal temperatures to most of the lower 48 and
push most of the precipitation chances to the south; namely,
Florida. There, a wavy stationary boundary will promote periodic
rainfall which may be heavy at times.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

With the ECMWF and GEFS ensembles in relatively good agreement,
favored the deterministic models that fell within their overlap
the best during the period. This was mostly near the 18Z GFS and
next nearest to the 12Z ECMWF. Uncertainty in the northern stream
flow out of Canada later next week as well as the breakdown of the
upper ridge in the Pacific led to large differences in the upper
pattern over much of the CONUS and, as such, utilized a mostly
ensemble mean blend to mitigate future large changes. Ensemble
trends were toward stronger closed centers in the higher latitudes
suggesting punctuated zonal flow to its south (over the CONUS) and
limited predictability.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
will be the focus for several rounds of potentially heavy rainfall
as the parallel upper flow from the southwest bring in episodes of
moisture and rainfall. The greatest risk will be over northern and
central Florida where several inches are likely in some areas
during the period. ECMWF EPS EFI highlights the area along and
north of I-4 for anomalous rainfall early in the week, then
sinking southward. This may be a significant multi-day event
leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the central
Rockies/western High Plains could see modest snow on Monday as a
cold front stalls in the area, yielding upslope snow potential.
Temperatures will be much colder than normal early in the week
with sub-freezing highs (15-30 degrees below normal). The cold
airmass will spill onto the southern Plains Tuesday where highs
may only reach the mid 50s over northern TX into OK, which may
challenge record cold highs.

Farther west, warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the
West Coast underneath ridging, though that may be tempered a bit
as a Pacific frontal system digs southward over the region.
Precipitation should be minimal and mainly over the mountains. The
East will see a couple chances of light rain and maybe some wet
snow in far northern areas, with temperatures near to slightly
below normal.

pattern over much of the CONUS and, as such, utilized a mostly
ensemble mean blend to mitigate future large changes. Ensemble
trends were toward stronger closed centers in the higher latitudes
suggesting punctuated zonal flow to its south (over the CONUS) and
limited predictability.

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

A frontal boundary stalling over the Gulf of Mexico and Florida
will be the focus for several rounds of potentially heavy rainfall
as the parallel upper flow from the southwest bring in episodes of
moisture and rainfall. The greatest risk will be over northern and
central Florida where several inches are likely in some areas
during the period. ECMWF EPS EFI highlights the area along and
north of I-4 for anomalous rainfall early in the week, then
sinking southward. This may be a significant multi-day event
leading to flooding issues.

Generally light precipitation will be possible near another
frontal system dropping south and eastward through the central and
eastern U.S. for the first half of next week. However, the central
Rockies/western High Plains could see modest snow on Monday as a
cold front stalls in the area, yielding upslope snow potential.
Temperatures will be much colder than normal early in the week
with sub-freezing highs (15-30 degrees below normal). The cold
airmass will spill onto the southern Plains Tuesday where highs
may only reach the mid 50s over northern TX into OK, which may
challenge record cold highs.

Farther west, warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the
West Coast underneath ridging, though that may be tempered a bit
as a Pacific frontal system digs southward over the region.
Precipitation should be minimal and mainly over the mountains. The
East will see a couple chances of light rain and maybe some wet
snow in far northern areas, with temperatures near to slightly
below normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1204 AM CDT Sat Apr 17 2021

Valid 171200Z - 181200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Surface high pressure over the central Rockies will limit overall
fire weather concerns today. Dry conditions will be present from the
Pacific Northwest across the Great Basin and into Arizona. However,
winds will be light across much of this region. Some locally
elevated winds may be present across portions of Nevada and southern
Arizona, but the longevity and isolated nature of the threat will
preclude any need for an elevated delineation.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1204 AM CDT Sat Apr 17 2021

Valid 181200Z - 191200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
On Sunday, a weak mid level shortwave trough will drop out of
British Columbia and lead to some surface cyclogenesis in the
Columbia Basin. This will bring a return to onshore flow across the
Pacific Northwest. Some breezy conditions are expected through the
gaps in the Cascades as well as across portions of eastern Oregon.
Multiple smoke plumes from fires across this region on Friday show
that at least some fuels are cured and are ready for fire spread.
Therefore, an elevated delineation is warranted for the threat.

Offshore flow is expected across portions of Southern California
starting Sunday morning. The strongest winds are expected to be in
the Mojave desert where fuels are minimal, but high resolution
guidance suggests some stronger winds reaching the coastal
mountains. Therefore, these stronger winds in addition to widespread
single digit relative humidity forecast across the region support an
elevated threat for large-fire spread.

A strong cold front is expected to dive south across the northern
Plains on Sunday. 20+ mph sustained winds are expected behind this
front, but rapidly dropping temperatures and the potential for some
rain/snow should limit the overall fire weather threat. Drought
conditions are ongoing in the northern Plains and some fire weather
threat may exist in any areas which do not receive any precipitation
despite relative humidity above 50 percent given the strong winds
and dry fuels. This will be monitored closely in later outlooks to
assess the need for an elevated delineation.

...Heavy Rainfall for parts of Florida Tuesday...

...Overview...

Strong upper ridging is forecast to drift west-northwestward out
of northwestern Canada and through Alaska as an upper low in the
northeastern Pacific wobbles its way toward the Pacific Northwest.
This favors troughing over most of the CONUS next week and cooler
than normal temperatures to all but the West. A wavy frontal
boundary will bring a chance of heavy rain over Florida from the
short range into the medium range early in the week before
dissipating. A lead boundary over the Plains to Midwest on Tuesday
will bring light rain and snow into the Great Lakes as it winds up
over southeastern Canada. A western system may tap the Gulf for
moisture later next week and bring widespread rainfall to the
lower Mississippi Valley by next weekend.

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment and Preferences...

The GFS/GEFS have struggled over the past week or so with the
amplified/cutoff flow from the Pacific across North America,
though over many areas they seemed fairly adequate. However,
overall preferred the ECMWF-led consensus with the 12Z Canadian
and the ECMWF ensembles which were generally more amplified than
the GFS/GEFS. There was a notable trend toward a slower
progression across Canada and the Northeast next Thursday with a
farther west upper low near the Canadian archipelago, allowing the
Northeast system to close off and wrap up over Maine. With the
upstream upper low still forecast to drop down into southern
Canada Friday, this should be enough of a kicker overall to nudge
the Maine system farther to the northeast. By later in the week,
the GFS may be too slow over Texas/Mexico with an upper/sfc system
(related to a slower progression of the incoming Pacific system
toward WA/OR) but the breakdown/relaxation of the amplified
pattern suggests low confidence in evolution. Opted to remain
closer to the ECMWF ensemble mean which typically handles
amplified flow the best, but even it can be too slow once the
pattern opens up (which can favor the GFS/GEFS).

...Weather/Hazards Highlights...

Northern and central Florida may see a continuation out of the
short range (Mon) into the medium range (Tue) with rainfall along
a front that will slowly push southward. Several inches are
possible in some areas during the period. Generally light
precipitation is expected near a frontal system moving into the
Great Lakes and Northeast Tue-Wed with some snow on its northwest
side. As the system deepens through the Northeast, rain/snow could
increase over New England where temperatures may be cold enough
for snow especially at higher elevations and overnight. The next
system of interest would be out of the southern Rockies around Fri
and through the Plains. A modest signal exists for at least some
heavy rainfall over the lower Mississippi Valley next Fri-Sat.

Warmer than normal temperatures are expected for the West Coast
closer to or underneath upper ridging, with much milder air just
ahead of the Pacific system late next week. The central states
will see the coldest readings relative to normal for late April,
perhaps 10-25 degrees below normal on Tuesday east of the Rockies
behind the frontal boundary. That cold air mass will push eastward
but moderate though parts of the East may see at least one day
with temperatures 5-15 degrees below normal (Thu along the I-81
corridor).

...Heavy wet snow ending across interior New England but another
snow event is in store for the northern Rockies late Sunday into
Monday...

...Threat of heavy rain shifts eastward from the central Gulf
Coast today to northern Florida during the next couple of days...

...Well above normal temperatures over the Pacific Northwest with
elevated fire danger over the interior sections...

The upper-level low responsible for the recent snowfall across the
central Rockies to central High Plains has weakened as its
remaining energy continues to move eastward into the Ohio Valley
before dissipating.  Some rain can be expected across the Ohio
Valley today but the highest threat of heavy rain will be along
the central Gulf Coast early today as a low pressure wave passes
just to the south.  The heavy rain threat will then shift eastward
into northern Florida for the next couple of days along a
slow-moving frontal boundary.  Periods of heavy rain with embedded
thunderstorms can also be expected as low pressure waves form from
time to time along the front.

Some accumulating snowfall will continue across the central
Rockies today and will dip into the southern Rockies on Sunday due
to a lingering frontal boundary just to the west. Meanwhile, a
surge of cold air is organizing across western Canada.  The
leading edge of the cold air is forecast to dip into the northern
High Plains early on Sunday bringing falling temperatures and the
arrival of mixed rain and snow.  The rain/snow mix will quickly
overspread much of the northern Rockies and northern High Plains
into Sunday night.  Increasingly gusty northerly winds will
continue to surge southward toward the central Rockies by Monday
morning as snow expands across the region especially along the
wind-facing mountain ranges.

Meanwhile, a compact coastal storm has brought areas of heavy wet
snow across the high elevations of the Northeast while a raw
rainstorm impacted the coastal regions.  The storm is beginning to
move off the New England coast and will gradually bring the
remaining snow to an end later today.  Scattered rain showers will
also taper off gradually near the coast.

Finally, gusty winds over parts of the Pacific Northwest will
contribute to an Elevated Risk of fire weather over the region
today.

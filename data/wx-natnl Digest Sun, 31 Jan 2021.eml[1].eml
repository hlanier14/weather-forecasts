Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0913 AM CST Sat Jan 30 2021

Valid 301700Z - 311200Z

No changes are needed for the ongoing forecast. Mid-morning visible
satellite imagery shows clear skies across west Texas due to
subsidence on the southwestern periphery of an eastward-translating
mid-level shortwave trough. As forecast, a deepening surface low
over the OK/TX Panhandles is currently driving strong westerly
pressure-gradient winds sustained at 25-35 mph with gusts up to
45-50 mph. RH values have also begun to fall across west TX, and
will continue to do so through the day. Although the strongest winds
will occur later this morning, breezy conditions remain likely this
afternoon when RH values reach their diurnal minimums in the teens
to low 20s. Elevated to critical wind/RH combinations remain likely,
but fuel concerns outlined below remain valid and preclude an
expansion or upgrade.

..Moore.. 01/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CST Sat Jan 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
A substantial dry sector will develop along and southwest of a
deepening surface low that will traverse the Kansas/Oklahoma border
today.  This dry sector will result in areas of increased surface
winds and lowered RH values, which may carry a risk of large fires
despite largely unfavorable fuels in several areas.  Elsewhere,
moist conditions across the central/southern Plains ahead of the low
should mitigate most fire-weather concerns outside of the elevated
area.  Recent precipitation in the Southwest should also mitigate
any fire-weather potential there.

...Eastern New Mexico into much of west and central Texas...
Recent radar mosaic imagery indicates areas of light precipitation
falling across portions of New Mexico and west Texas ahead of a
vigorous shortwave near the Four Corners.  This precip and
associated cloud cover should shift eastward through the forecast
period and allow for heating of an increasingly dry low-level
airmass later today, with RH values near 15% becoming likely amidst
20-30 mph westerly surface winds.  Fuels states remain a limiting
factor for any larger-scale fire-weather risk as ERCs remain low for
this time of year and light precip may moisten fuels locally.
Nevertheless, an elevated area remains in place for the outlook in
the event areas of cured fuels happen to develop amidst the dry and
windy conditions.

NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1220 PM CST Sat Jan 30 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

No forecast changes are needed. Recent guidance continues to suggest
low fire potential across the driest portions of the CONUS.

..Moore.. 01/30/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0104 AM CST Sat Jan 30 2021/

...Synopsis...
The surface low initially centered over the Mid-Mississippi/Lower
Ohio Valleys will continue to slide eastward while secondary
cyclogenesis occurs across the Carolinas.  This system will shift
moist low-level air to the east, but also allow for weaker winds to
develop across the southern Plains/Rockies as cooler air and high
pressure settles into the High Plains.  Ultimately, the fire-weather
risk in these areas will lessen compared to D1/Sat in response to
the weaker winds and higher RH.  Elsewhere, copious amounts of
precipitation in recent days has mitigate fire-weather concerns in
California.  Quiescent fire-weather is expected elsewhere across the
CONUS through the forecast period.

...Winter Storm for the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast early next week and
from the West to the Midwest/Northeast mid-later next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Global models this morning have generally agreed that a deep
cyclone will gradually weaken but will be slow to exit New England
early in the medium-range period.  Models have a tendency to keep
a swath of wintry precipitation across interior New England
Tuesday into early Wednesday.  Meanwhile, a surge of colder air
from Canada is forecast to interact with an upper trough to be
ejected into the central/southern Plains by late next week.
Deterministic solutions from the global models show considerable
difficulties in timing this interaction as large amount of spread
is shown regarding the timing and intensity of the incipient
cyclogenesis across the central U.S.  In addition, these
deterministic solutions diverge noticeable away from their
corresponding ensemble mean solutions by Day 6 and 7.  In spite of
the model spread, there is actually decent agreement among the
ensemble means from the ECMWF, GEFS, and the CMC that a low
pressure system will develop over the central Plains on Thursday
and the track across the Great Lakes on Friday.  A consensus of
the 00Z EC mean, the 06Z GEFS, and the 00Z CMC mean yielded very
good agreement with WPC continuity.  Therefore, a blend of these
three ensemble means were used to construct this morning's WPC
forecast charts for Days 6 and 7, with no deterministic solutions
were included.  Some deterministic solutions were included for
Days 3 to 5.  By next weekend, there appears to be reasonable
agreement for a reinforcing shot of cold air to push into the
northern and central Plains.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

For the deep cyclone near New England, wintry precipitation inland
should culminate on Tuesday before gradual tapering off by
Wednesday morning.  Some areas along or offshore the coast should
continue to experience brisk to strong winds into Thursday as the
cyclone will be slow to depart.

A strong upper trough digging into CA Tue-Wed will support a
period of enhanced moisture/rains and heavy Sierra snows, with
more modest enhanced amounts focusing on favored terrain and with
deformation for the south-central Great Basin/Rockies. Variance
with the extent of digging leads to subsequent ejection
differences. Differences grow downstream along with uncertain
stream phasing/central U.S. storm genesis mid-later next week. I t
is expected that as the energy comes out of the West and Rockies,
a deepening low to the lee of the Rockies will lift toward the
Great Lakes.  Strong warm air advection and moisture return on the
backside of the departing high will allow for copious amounts of
moisture to work with the better dynamics and forcing.  Over the
north-central to northeastern U.S., a swath of mixed precipitation
and wrap-back snows can be expected near and north of the main
cyclone track.  Another batch of wintry precipitation is forecast
to track down the northern and central Rockies late next week
associated with an arctic front.

...Winter Storm for the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast early next week and
from the West to the Midwest/Northeast mid-later next week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

Global models this morning have generally agreed that a deep
cyclone will gradually weaken but will be slow to exit New England
early in the medium-range period.  Models have a tendency to keep
a swath of wintry precipitation across interior New England
Tuesday into early Wednesday.  Meanwhile, a surge of colder air
from Canada is forecast to interact with an upper trough to be
ejected into the central/southern Plains by late next week.
Deterministic solutions from the global models show considerable
difficulties in timing this interaction as large amount of spread
is shown regarding the timing and intensity of the incipient
cyclogenesis across the central U.S.  In addition, these
deterministic solutions diverge noticeable away from their
corresponding ensemble mean solutions by Day 6 and 7.  In spite of
the model spread, there is actually decent agreement among the
ensemble means from the ECMWF, GEFS, and the CMC that a low
pressure system will develop over the central Plains on Thursday
and the track across the Great Lakes on Friday.  A consensus of
the 00Z EC mean, the 06Z GEFS, and the 00Z CMC mean yielded very
good agreement with WPC continuity.  Therefore, a blend of these
three ensemble means were used to construct this morning's WPC
forecast charts for Days 6 and 7, with no deterministic solutions
were included.  Some deterministic solutions were included for
Days 3 to 5.  By next weekend, there appears to be reasonable
agreement for a reinforcing shot of cold air to push into the
northern and central Plains.

...Major winter storm to track from the Midwest this evening to
the Northeast coast by Monday with significant snowfall and
hazardous travel conditions expected...

...Over 95 million Americans are under a winter weather warning,
watch, or advisory...

...Heavy rain and mountain snow to develop over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern California...

The spotlight is squarely on a large winter storm unfolding in the
Nation's Heartland this afternoon as it sets its sights on the
Northeast early this week. As of the issuance of this discussion,
more than 95 million Americans were under either a Winter Storm
Warning, Watch, or Winter Weather Advisory. The storm is tracking
east with a large shield of precipitation being ushered out ahead
of it. Showers and thunderstorms are passing over parts of the
central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley this afternoon. As
precipitation runs into sub-freezing temperatures in the Midwest,
periods of snow will ensue with snow falling heavily at times
tonight. The axis of heavy snow then pushed into the Lower Great
Lakes where accumulating snowfall is also anticipated. Latest
snowfall forecast calls for a swath of 8 inches or more of snow
from the Chicago and Milwaukee metro areas to northern Indiana and
Ohio through Sunday afternoon. Expect poor travel conditions to be
common throughout these areas throughout the day on Sunday. As the
storm heads east, showers and thunderstorms will track through the
Southeast Sunday afternoon while a wedge of cold Canadian high
pressure sets the stage for accumulating snowfall across the
central Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic. An icy wintry mix
in parts of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont and foothills
could lead to ice accretion as high as a quarter inch on Sunday.
Travel conditions will be treacherous in these areas Sunday
afternoon.

Once the parent storm system marches east into upper Ohio Valley
Sunday night, a developing frontal wave over eastern North
Carolina will become the focus for a new developing area of low
pressure Sunday night. Snowfall over the northern Mid-Atlantic
Sunday night may switch over to a wintry mix for some, but by
Monday the new coastal low quickly strengthens off the DelMarVa
Peninsula coast on Monday, forcing bands of heavy snow to form
from the central Appalachians to the Northeast's immediate I-95
corridor. Significant snowfall and travel disruptions are
anticipated in these areas with over a foot of snow likely in the
hardest hit areas of the Northeast on Monday. The coastal storm
will stall off the Northeast coast as the upper level low to the
west and blocking ridge of high pressure to the north slow its
progress. Snowfall is likely to persist over the Northeast Monday
night and into the day on Tuesday. In addition to the snowfall,
gusty winds may lead to near whiteout conditions and battering
waves along the Northeast coast could foster areas of coastal
flooding and beach erosion. Residents in these regions should
continue to monitor the forecast closely for the most up-to-date
information.

Meanwhile in the West, a series of frontal systems will move into
the Pacific Northwest/Northern California over the next few days.
A fetch of Pacific moisture associated with them will usher in
more precipitation throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. The heaviest area of rainfall through Monday evening
appears to occur in southwest Oregon and Northern California where
as much 5 inches. Along the Cascade Range, snowfall ranging
between 1 to 2 feet in accumulation is on tap through Monday
evening.

...Major winter storm to track from the Midwest this evening to
the Northeast coast by Monday with significant snowfall and
hazardous travel conditions expected...

...Over 95 million Americans are under a winter weather warning,
watch, or advisory...

...Heavy rain and mountain snow to develop over parts of the
Pacific Northwest and Northern California...

The spotlight is squarely on a large winter storm unfolding in the
Nation's Heartland this afternoon as it sets its sights on the
Northeast early this week. As of the issuance of this discussion,
more than 95 million Americans were under either a Winter Storm
Warning, Watch, or Winter Weather Advisory. The storm is tracking
east with a large shield of precipitation being ushered out ahead
of it. Showers and thunderstorms are passing over parts of the
central Plains and mid-Mississippi Valley this afternoon. As
precipitation runs into sub-freezing temperatures in the Midwest,
periods of snow will ensue with snow falling heavily at times
tonight. The axis of heavy snow then pushed into the Lower Great
Lakes where accumulating snowfall is also anticipated. Latest
snowfall forecast calls for a swath of 8 inches or more of snow
from the Chicago and Milwaukee metro areas to northern Indiana and
Ohio through Sunday afternoon. Expect poor travel conditions to be
common throughout these areas during the day on Sunday. As the
storm heads east, showers and thunderstorms will track through the
Southeast Sunday afternoon while a wedge of cold Canadian high
pressure sets the stage for accumulating snowfall across the
central Appalachians and northern Mid-Atlantic. An icy wintry mix
in parts of the Virginia and North Carolina Piedmont and foothills
could lead to ice accretion as high as a quarter inch on Sunday.
Travel conditions will be treacherous in these areas Sunday
afternoon.

Once the parent storm system marches east into upper Ohio Valley
Sunday night, a developing frontal wave over eastern North
Carolina will become the focus for a new developing area of low
pressure Sunday night. Snowfall over the northern Mid-Atlantic
Sunday night may switch over to a wintry mix for some, but by
Monday the new coastal low quickly strengthens off the DelMarVa
Peninsula coast on Monday, forcing bands of heavy snow to form
from the central Appalachians to the Northeast's immediate I-95
corridor. Significant snowfall and travel disruptions are
anticipated in these areas with over a foot of snow likely in the
hardest hit areas of the Northeast on Monday. The coastal storm
will stall off the Northeast coast as the upper level low to the
west and blocking ridge of high pressure to the north slow its
progress. Snowfall is likely to persist over the Northeast Monday
night and into the day on Tuesday. In addition to the snowfall,
gusty winds may lead to near whiteout conditions and battering
waves along the Northeast coast could foster areas of coastal
flooding and beach erosion. Residents in these regions should
continue to monitor the forecast closely for the most up-to-date
information.

Meanwhile in the West, a series of frontal systems will move into
the Pacific Northwest/Northern California over the next few days.
A fetch of Pacific moisture associated with them will usher in
more precipitation throughout the Pacific Northwest and Northern
California. The heaviest area of rainfall through Monday evening
appears to occur in southwest Oregon and Northern California where
as much 5 inches. Along the Cascade Range, snowfall ranging
between 1 to 2 feet in accumulation is on tap through Monday
evening.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1241 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
The quiescent fire-weather expected on D1/Sun will continue into
D2/Mon.  An eastern CONUS trough/western CONUS ridge will remain in
place throughout the forecast period.  Meanwhile, a coastal low will
organize off the Mid-Atlantic and weak lee troughing organizes
across the High Plains.  Generally weak surface flow will exist
across much of the Plains despite areas of locally dry conditions
(RH values less than 25% during peak heating).  Additionally, a
moist airmass will remain in place across much of California due to
onshore flow.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1241 AM CST Sun Jan 31 2021

Valid 311200Z - 011200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
Quiescent fire-weather conditions are expected across the CONUS
today.  A longwave trough will become further established across the
eastern CONUS while ridging develops across the Intermountain West.
At the surface, a couple of low pressure areas will approach the
Appalachians and coastal areas of the Carolinas while high pressure
areas reside across the Plains and central Rockies.  The resulting
pattern will produce relatively weak winds in most areas of the
Plains, with recent rainfall and low ERCs mitigating any
fire-weather risk.  Recent precipitation across California and
onshore flow should keep any fire-weather risk to a minimum there.

...Potent midweek CA system to progress to the
Plains/Midwest/Northeast later week...

...Guidance/Predictability Assessment...

The WPC medium range product suite was primarily derived from a
composite blend of the GFS/ECMWF, GEFS/ECMWF ensemble means and
the National Blend of Models. Blend weightings in favor of the
well clustered models days 3/4 (Wed/Thu) transition to mainly the
still reasonably compatible ensemble means by next weekend amid
growing forecast spread.

...Weather/Threats Highlights...

For the deep cyclone near New England, wintry precipitation inland
should gradual taper off into Wednesday, but some areas along or
offshore the coast should continue to experience brisk to strong
winds into Thursday as the cyclone will be slow to depart.

A strong upper trough driving through CA Wed will support a period
of enhanced moisture/rains and mountain snows, with activity
spreading across the south-central Great Basin/Rockies with system
progression. Variance with the extent of digging still leads to
subsequent ejection differences. Model differences grow downstream
along with uncertain stream phasing/central U.S. storm genesis
mid-later next week. It is expected that as the energy comes out
of the West and Rockies, a deepening low or lows to the lee of the
Rockies will lift toward the Great Lakes. Leading warm air
advection and moisture return on the backside of the departing
high will allow deepening Gulf moisture interact with the
favorable dynamics and forcing. This will fuel an expanding area
of moderate to locally heavier precipitation across the
east-central U.S. Enhanced wrap-back snows can be expected near
and to the north of the main cyclone track over the north-central
to northeastern U.S.. However, low support aloft/phasing details
remain uncertain. Upstream, another batch of wintry precipitation
is forecast to track down over the Northwest and then the northern
and central Rockies late week associated with a polar front with
approach of new digging upper trough energies. Frontal surges,
lead ejecting waves and main upper trough amplification back over
the central U.S. next weekend may favor some uncertain modest
swaths of snows from the Midwest/OH Valley to the Appalachians and
the Northeast, including some lake effect enhancement and focus.

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest...

A deep storm over the Ohio Valley will move eastward to off the
Mid-Atlantic Coast, then move northeastward along the coast by
Tuesday.  The snow over the Upper Midwest will slowly wind down
today into Monday morning.  The system will produce snow over
parts of the Ohio Valley into the Mid-Atlantic with rain over
parts of the Southern Ohio Valley/Tennessee Valley into the
Southeast through today.  Areas of rain/freezing rain will develop
over parts of the Central Appalachians/southern Mid-Atlantic today
and into parts of the northern Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  The snow
on the backside of the system will extend into the Southern
Appalachians on Monday into Tuesday.  The rain over the Southeast
will slowly come to an end by Tuesday morning.  As the storm moves
along the Mid-Atlantic Coast and off the New England Coast, snow
will move northward out of the Mid-Atlantic into parts of the
Northeast and New England by Monday into Tuesday morning.  The
snow will also start to taper off across the Ohio Valley on
Tuesday morning.

Meanwhile, multiple fronts will move into the Pacific Northwest
today, moving inland to parts of the Northern Intermountain Region
and Central California by Tuesday.  The boundary will have a plume
of moisture associated with it streaming moisture into parts of
Northern California and the Pacific Northwest.  Rain and some
higher elevation snow will develop over parts of Northern
California and the Pacific Northwest through early Tuesday.  The
WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over Northern
California and southwestern Oregon from Sunday morning through
early Monday.  The rain will be heavy enough to produce mainly
localized scattered areas of flash flooding.  The most vulnerable
areas will be urban areas, roads, and small streams.  Overnight
Monday, the snow levels will lower over the region, with snow
advancing across the Cascades, Siskiyou, and Shasta Mountains.

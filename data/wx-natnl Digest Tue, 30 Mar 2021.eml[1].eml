Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1201 PM CDT Mon Mar 29 2021

Valid 291700Z - 301200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THE PLAINS AND
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...

Overall the forecast is on track with critical to extremely critical
meteorological conditions already being observed in western
Nebraska/southern South Dakota and in southeast Colorado. In fact,
one large fire has already been spotted in the foothills of the
Black Hills west of Rapid City with the cold front approaching late
this morning. This fire and any subsequent fires will have the
potential for large fire growth and erratic behavior, especially
near cold frontal passage.

Expanded the elevated/critical areas slightly southeast in Texas to
account for the latest guidance and the eastern extent of the
dryline mixing that is expected.

..Bentley.. 03/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0130 AM CDT Mon Mar 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
A mid-level short-wave trough positioned over portions of the
Pacific Northwest will shift eastward and overspread much of the
central CONUS throughout the day while undergoing significant
amplification. This process will result in a broad region of
enhanced mid-level flow (60-90 kt) atop much of the northern/central
Plains and the southern High Plains. At the surface, a cold front,
associated with an intensifying surface cyclone over south-central
Canada, will move east-southeast out of Montana into the Dakotas,
northwestern parts of Nebraska and far western Minnesota.

...Southern High Plains into eastern Colorado and Kansas...
Diurnal heating and mixing, combined with a strengthening surface
pressure gradient, will produce sustained winds of 20-30 mph,
gusting to near 40 mph. A downsloping westerly component to the
low-level flow will allow temperatures to warm into the 80s F, which
will drive down RH values into the teens and single digits. Despite
fuels across region remaining somewhat marginally receptive to
large-fire spread, the aforementioned meteorological indices should
support elevated to critical fire-weather conditions across the
region.

...Northern Plains...
A broad region of critical fire-weather conditions can be expected
today, in association with both pre- and post-frontal winds. Ahead
of the front, sustained southwesterly winds of 20-25 mph (gusting to
near 30 mph) and RH values should fall into the teens as diurnal
heating occurs. With the frontal passage, surface winds will
increase to sustained values near 30-40 mph with gusts of 45-50 mph
possible from the northwest. Temperatures are expected to fall
behind the front into the 40s and 50s F, which may help limit the
fire-weather potential to some extent, but considering the strength
of the aforementioned post-frontal winds combined with dry/receptive
fuels across the region, there is sufficient evidence to maintain
the critical designation. Surrounding the critical area, elevated
fire-weather conditions can be expected where the pre-frontal
airmass is expected to reside most of the day, and far behind the
front where air temperatures will be exceedingly cooler.

300 PM EDT Mon Mar 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 01 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021

...Overall Weather Pattern...

A deep upper trough and a cold surface high pressure system will
settle across the eastern U.S. late week into weekend behind a
deepening cyclone exiting New England.   On the other hand, an
upper ridge edging into the Plains will bring persistent warmth
into the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to show
uncertainty across the Pacific Northwest where the next upper
trough/low should bring an increasing chance of light to possibly
moderate precipitation moving into the Northwest and northern half
of California by next Sunday into Monday.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The model guidance suite the morning continues to show excellent
agreement on predicting the amplitude and timing of the deep upper
trough settling across the eastern U.S. late this week into the
weekend.  The excellent model agreement also extends westward
through much of the Plains and into the southern Rockies as the
cold high in the East gradually modifies and persistent southerly
flow expands the warm air mass across the northern Plains.  The
greatest uncertainty is across the Pacific Northwest where models
continue to show some difficulties in handling an upper trough
digging down from the Gulf of Alaska and its interaction with a
southern stream wave lifting across the eastern Pacific.  The
ECMWF has continued to be the slowest guidance with a closed off
upper low off the West Coast early next week.  The GFS is not as
slow.  The ECMWF and GEFS means agree quite well however.  The CMC
offers the fastest solution regarding this system.  The WPC
guidance was based on a general compromise of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC
mean and the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS together with some contributions
from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a solution quite
similar to the previous WPC forecast package.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

A cold air mass will be ushered into the eastern U.S. in the wake
of an intensifying low pressure system exiting New England on
Thursday.  Rain initially over Maine should change over to a
period of snow before ending across northern New England.  Windy
conditions are also likely for the East Coast on Thursday with a
strong pressure gradient in place.  Temperatures will then dip
well below freezing by Friday morning over much of the interior
eastern U.S. before warm air gradually filters in from the west as
the cold high pressure system modifies and settles into the
Southeast.  Meanwhile, a extended period of very warm and dry
weather ins forecast to settle across the northern Plains under a
slow-moving upper ridge and persistent southerly surface flow.
This could enhance the fire danger across the region by this
weekend and early next week.

Temperatures will be more reminiscent of late February for much of
the eastern half of the nation to close out the work week with
blustery conditions behind the cold front, and subfreezing low
temperatures likely reaching as far south as northern Georgia and
South Carolina by Friday morning.  The cold weather will abate
going into the weekend as the airmass modifies and the upper level
trough lifts out across eastern Canada.  Much warmer weather is
forecast to return to much of the central and western U.S. in time
for the weekend, as an upper level ridge builds in along with
southerly flow ahead of the next frontal boundary, and results in
readings of 15 to potentially 25 degrees above normal.  Highs
could reach the low 80s across portions of Nebraska and South
Dakota, and the low-mid 90s for the lower elevations of the Desert
Southwest.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Mon Mar 29 2021

Valid 12Z Thu Apr 01 2021 - 12Z Mon Apr 05 2021

...Overall Weather Pattern...

A deep upper trough and a cold surface high pressure system will
settle across the eastern U.S. late week into weekend behind a
deepening cyclone exiting New England.   On the other hand, an
upper ridge edging into the Plains will bring persistent warmth
into the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to show
uncertainty across the Pacific Northwest where the next upper
trough/low should bring an increasing chance of light to possibly
moderate precipitation moving into the Northwest and northern half
of California by next Sunday into Monday.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The model guidance suite the morning continues to show excellent
agreement on predicting the amplitude and timing of the deep upper
trough settling across the eastern U.S. late this week into the
weekend.  The excellent model agreement also extends westward
through much of the Plains and into the southern Rockies as the
cold high in the East gradually modifies and persistent southerly
flow expands the warm air mass across the northern Plains.  The
greatest uncertainty is across the Pacific Northwest where models
continue to show some difficulties in handling an upper trough
digging down from the Gulf of Alaska and its interaction with a
southern stream wave lifting across the eastern Pacific.  The
ECMWF has continued to be the slowest guidance with a closed off
upper low off the West Coast early next week.  The GFS is not as
slow.  The ECMWF and GEFS means agree quite well however.  The CMC
offers the fastest solution regarding this system.  The WPC
guidance was based on a general compromise of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC
mean and the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS together with some contributions
from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a solution quite
similar to the previous WPC forecast package.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

A cold air mass will be ushered into the eastern U.S. in the wake
of an intensifying low pressure system exiting New England on
Thursday.  Rain initially over Maine should change over to a
period of snow before ending across northern New England.  Windy
conditions are also likely for the East Coast on Thursday with a
strong pressure gradient in place.  Temperatures will then dip
well below freezing by Friday morning over much of the interior
eastern U.S. before warm air gradually filters in from the west as
the cold high pressure system modifies and settles into the
Southeast.  Meanwhile, a extended period of very warm and dry
weather ins forecast to settle across the northern Plains under a
slow-moving upper ridge and persistent southerly surface flow.
This could enhance the fire danger across the region by this
weekend and early next week.

Temperatures will be more reminiscent of late February for much of
the eastern half of the nation to close out the work week with
blustery conditions behind the cold front, and subfreezing low
temperatures likely reaching as far south as northern Georgia and
South Carolina by Friday morning.  The cold weather will abate
going into the weekend as the airmass modifies and the upper level
trough lifts out across eastern Canada.  Much warmer weather is
forecast to return to much of the central and western U.S. in time
for the weekend, as an upper level ridge builds in along with
southerly flow ahead of the next frontal boundary, and results in
readings of 15 to potentially 25 degrees above normal.  Highs
could reach the low 80s across portions of Nebraska and South
Dakota, and the low-mid 90s for the lower elevations of the Desert
Southwest.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Mon March 29 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 04 - 08 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement in regards to the 500-hPa flo=
w
pattern across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day
period. Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa ridge over the Northern Pacific
associated with above normal heights extending across southwestern Alaska. =
A
trough with below normal heights is forecast from northern Mainland Alaska
down
to the western CONUS. A broad ridge is favored to build over the central an=
d
eastern CONUS, associated with above normal heights.

Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced across the Pacific
Coast to the Rockies associated with below normal heights. Broad ridging
predicted over the central and eastern CONUS favors above normal temperatur=
es
from the rest of the CONUS, except for the extreme southern part of Florida
Peninsula, where below normal temperatures are favored. Forecast surface lo=
w
pressure systems over southern Alaska during the 6-10 day period increase t=
he
odds of below normal temperatures. Above normal 500-hPa heights increase
chances of above normal temperatures over the western Aleutians.

Strong westerly mid-level flow with the troughing continues to favor above
normal precipitation for Alaska, except for parts of the southern coast of
Mainland Alaska, where below normal precipitation is favored. Enhanced
troughing over the Pacific Coast is expected to increase Pacific flow acros=
s
the western CONUS, leading to elevated chances of near to above normal
precipitation over the West, extending to the Northern Plains and Upper
Mississippi Valley. Increased odds of below normal precipitation are indica=
ted
across the Central and Southern Plains to the eastern CONUS, underneath the
predicted mean ridging.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 5 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models and tools.



8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 06 - 12 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is forecast to shift
eastward and deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. A 500-hPa ridge is
forecast across the central and eastern CONUS with associated above normal
heights. Below normal heights are forecast over the western CONUS due to an
eastward progressing through. Ridging is forecast across southwestern Alask=
a
with the manual blend depicting above normal heights, while troughing is
forecast across central and northern Alaska with below normal heights likel=
y.

Forecast surface low pressure leads to increased chances of near to below
normal temperatures across Alaska, except over the Aleutians. Troughing fav=
ors
below normal temperatures across the western CONUS. Elevated chances of abo=
ve
normal temperatures are forecast across the central and eastern CONUS
underneath of the mean ridging.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across much of Ala=
ska
due to predicted enhanced westerly mid-level flow and the troughting, excep=
t
over the Alaska Panhandle, where below normal precipitation is favored.
Enhanced Pacific flow across the western CONUS elevates chances of above
normal
precipitation over parts of the Northwest. Ahead of the 500-hPa trough, abo=
ve
normal precipitation is favored for parts of the  Great Plains and Mississi=
ppi
Valley, while below normal precipitation is favored for the eastern CONUS.
Below normal precipitation is forecast over parts of the central and southe=
rn
High Plains, consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool.


The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good model agreement, offset by some differences among temperature and
precipitation tools.

FORECASTER: Qin Z

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
April 15.

FOR TUESDAY APRIL 06 - MONDAY APRIL 12: There is relatively good model
agreement and run to run model consistency amongst the GEFS, ECMWF, and
Canadian ensemble means indicating mid-level high pressure over the eastern
two-thirds of the CONUS and mid-level low pressure over the western third
throughout week-2. Both of these mid-level features are anticipated to be
amplified at the start of the period, and become more deamplified through t=
he
course of the outlook period. Mid-level troughing across the western CONUS
supports a slight risk for much below normal temperatures over parts of the
Pacific Northwest, Northern California, northwestern Nevada, and Idaho, Mar=
 6
to 10, where the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of
minimum temperatures falling to the lowest 15th percentile. This anomalous
cold
signal was indicated by multiple models last week but is stronger in today'=
s
forecasts. The GEFS reforecast tool shows this risk extending further
southwestward into Nevada and the Four Corners Region. Due to this region
having recently experienced sub-freezing temperatures and differences
regarding
the spatial coverage of greatest hazard potential in the reforecast tools, =
a
relatively scoped area is highlighted for this risk today.





A series of surface lows are predicted to form over the Great Plains, with
associated frontal activity possibly moving across the central and eastern
CONUS during week-2. An initial surface low is anticipated to form over the
Northern Plains at the beginning of the period. These surface lows and fron=
ts
may support periods of localized high winds across parts of the southwester=
n
and central CONUS during the period. A slight risk of high winds is posted
across parts of the Great Plains, Central and Southern Rockies, Central Gre=
at
Basin, and Southwest, Mar 6 to 8, where both the reforecast tools indicate =
at
least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds exceeding the 85th percentile a=
nd
25 mph. There are greater than 30% probabilities indicated by the reforecas=
t
tools for maximum wind speeds exceeding the aforementioned thresholds over =
the
Four Corners Region and Nevada. The 6Z deterministic GFS shows the potentia=
l
for localized wind speeds exceeding 30 mph over some of these regions.
Enhanced
wind speeds may also support increase the risk for wildfires across parts o=
f
the Southwest, western Texas, and parts of the Great Plains, where the
National
Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) shows increased risk of significant fire
potential at the end of week-1, and where regions are currently experiencin=
g
anomalous dry conditions.



There is good agreement amongst the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble mean=
s
indicating negative mid-level 500-hPa height departures over many parts of
mainland Alaska during week-2. Surface high pressure over mainland Alaska i=
s
anticipated to bring anomalous cold into many parts of the state. A slight
risk
of much below normal temperatures is highlighted across many inland portion=
s
of
Mainland Alaska, Mar 6-8, where there is at least a 40% chance of minimum
temperatures falling to the lowest 10th percentile in both the ECMWF and GE=
FS
reforecast tools. A moderate risk for much below normal temperatures is pos=
ted
across eastern Mainland Alaska, where there is greater than 50 to 60% chanc=
es
of minimum temperatures reaching these thresholds, Mar 6 to 7. Some areas m=
ay
experience minimum temperatures falling below -20 DegF, with localized area=
s
possibly reaching or approaching record low temperatures in Interior Alaska=
 at
the beginning of week-2. High pressure across the Yukon combined with possi=
ble
surface low formation over the Gulf of Alaska could increase chances for
localized gap and outflow winds, mainly over the Kenai Peninsula, at the

...Overall Weather Pattern...

A deep upper trough and a cold surface high pressure system will
settle across the eastern U.S. late week into weekend behind a
deepening cyclone exiting New England.   On the other hand, an
upper ridge edging into the Plains will bring persistent warmth
into the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to show
uncertainty across the Pacific Northwest where the next upper
trough/low should bring an increasing chance of light to possibly
moderate precipitation across the Northwest and the northern half
of California by next Sunday into Monday.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The model guidance suite this morning continues to show excellent
agreement on predicting the amplitude and timing of the deep upper
trough settling across the eastern U.S. late this week into the
weekend.  The excellent model agreement also extends westward
through much of the Plains and into the southern Rockies as the
cold high in the East gradually modifies and persistent southerly
flow expands the warm air mass across the northern Plains.  The
greatest uncertainty is across the Pacific Northwest where models
continue to show some difficulties in handling an upper trough
digging down from the Gulf of Alaska and its interaction with a
southern stream wave lifting across the eastern Pacific.  The
ECMWF has continued to be the slowest guidance with a closed off
upper low off the West Coast early next week.  The GFS is not as
slow.  The ECMWF and GEFS means agree quite well however.  The CMC
offers the fastest solution regarding this system.  The WPC
guidance was based on a general compromise of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC
mean and the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS together with some contributions
from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a solution quite
similar to the previous WPC forecast package.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

A cold air mass will be ushered into the eastern U.S. in the wake
of an intensifying low pressure system exiting New England on
Thursday.  Rain initially over Maine should change over to a
period of snow before ending across northern New England.  Windy
conditions are also likely for the East Coast on Thursday with a
strong pressure gradient in place.  Temperatures will then dip
well below freezing by Friday morning over much of the interior
eastern U.S., reminiscent of late February for much of the region.
 Warmer air will gradually filter in from the west as the cold
high pressure system modifies and settles into the Southeast into
the weekend.  Meanwhile, an extended period of very warm and dry
weather is forecast to settle across the northern Plains under a
slow-moving upper ridge and persistent southerly surface flow.
This could enhance the fire danger across the region by this
weekend and early next week.

A slow cooling trend is expected for the West Coast and especially
the Pacific Northwest where the next upper trough/low is forecast
to approach by the weekend.  This will likely be accompanied with
an increasing chance of light to possibly moderate precipitation
moving inland across the Northwest and the northern half of
California by Sunday into Monday depending on the speed of
progression of the system.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0247 PM CDT Mon Mar 29 2021

Valid 301200Z - 311200Z

Added a small elevated area in the northern Central Valley in
California where gusty northerly winds are expected to reach 15 to
20 mph amid relative humidity of 12 to 18 percent. Otherwise, a
minor eastward expansion of the elevated area was made in West
Texas.

..Bentley.. 03/29/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0132 AM CDT Mon Mar 29 2021/

...Synopsis...
A large-scale trough positioned over the central CONUS will slowly
shift eastward throughout the forecast period. As this occurs,
ridging will take hold across much of the West. At the surface, a
cold front will continue sweeping across the central Plains, while
high pressure builds into the West.

...Southeast Arizona, southern New Mexico and Far West Texas...
Diurnally driven mixing of enhanced mid-level flow over the region
will allow strong winds to mix toward the surface, resulting in
sustained westerly winds of 20-30 mph while RH values fall into the
teens and single digits. Despite somewhat marginally receptive
fuels, dry conditions remain present across the region, supporting
the potential for critical fire-weather conditions during the
afternoon hours.

...Southern California...
Surface high pressure is expected to settle into the Great Basin
region, which will result the development of a surface pressure
gradient conducive for offshore winds. Sustained winds of 20-30 mph
can be expected, gusting to 35+ mph (particularly in terrain-favored
regions). Meanwhile RH values will fall into the single digits as
temperatures warm into the 80s F by afternoon. Despite these
conditions, fuels across the region are marginally receptive to
large-fire spread. Thus, elevated to locally critical fire-weather
conditions appear likely.

Thursday.  Rain initially over Maine should change over to a
period of snow before ending as light snow tapers off across
northern New England Thursday night.  Windy conditions are likely
for the East Coast on Thursday with a strong pressure gradient in
place.  Temperatures will then dip well below freezing by Friday
morning over much of the interior eastern U.S., with many daily
record low temperatures forecast for Friday morning.  Warmer air
will gradually filter in from the west as the cold high pressure
system modifies and settles into the Southeast into the weekend.
Meanwhile, an extended period of very warm and dry weather is
forecast to settle across the northern Plains under a slow-moving
upper ridge and persistent southerly surface flow.  This could
enhance the fire danger across the region by this weekend and
early next week.

A slow cooling trend is expected for the West Coast and especially
the Pacific Northwest where the next upper trough/low is forecast
to approach by the weekend.  This will likely be accompanied with
an increasing chance of light to possibly moderate precipitation
moving inland across the Northwest and the northern half of
California by Sunday into Monday depending on the speed of
progression of the system.

...Overall Weather Pattern...

A deep upper trough and a cold surface high pressure system will
settle across the eastern U.S. late week into weekend behind a
deepening cyclone exiting New England.   On the other hand, an
upper ridge edging into the Plains will bring persistent warmth
into the northern Plains.  Meanwhile, models continue to show
uncertainty across the Pacific Northwest where the next upper
trough/low should bring an increasing chance of light to possibly
moderate precipitation across the Northwest and the northern half
of California by next Sunday into Monday.

...Model Guidance and Predictability...

The model guidance suite this morning continues to show excellent
agreement on predicting the amplitude and timing of the deep upper
trough settling across the eastern U.S. late this week into the
weekend.  The excellent model agreement also extends westward
through much of the Plains and into the southern Rockies as the
cold high in the East gradually modifies and persistent southerly
flow expands the warm air mass across the northern Plains.  The
greatest uncertainty is across the Pacific Northwest where models
continue to show some difficulties in handling an upper trough
digging down from the Gulf of Alaska and its interaction with a
southern stream wave lifting across the eastern Pacific.  The
ECMWF has continued to be the slowest guidance with a closed off
upper low off the West Coast early next week.  The GFS is not as
slow.  The ECMWF and GEFS means agree quite well however.  The CMC
offers the fastest solution regarding this system.  The WPC
guidance was based on a general compromise of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC
mean and the 06Z GFS/06Z GEFS together with some contributions
from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a solution quite
similar to the previous WPC forecast package.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

A cold air mass will be ushered into the eastern U.S. in the wake
of an intensifying low pressure system exiting New England on
Thursday.  Rain initially over Maine should change over to a
period of snow before ending as light snow tapers off across
northern New England Thursday night.  Windy conditions are likely
for the East Coast on Thursday with a strong pressure gradient in
place.  Temperatures will then dip well below freezing by Friday
morning over much of the interior eastern U.S., with many daily
record low temperatures forecast for Friday morning.  Warmer air

...High winds and widespread fire danger are expected to continue
this evening across much of the central CONUS...

...Moderate to heavy rain will once again affect the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys beginning Tuesday...

A low pressure system and a potent cold front sweeping across the
central and eastern U.S. over the next couple of days will cause a
myriad of weather hazards both ahead of and behind it. As the deep
surface low moves across south-central Canada through early
Tuesday, the tight pressure gradient will lead to continued high
winds for northern/central portions of the Rockies and Plains.
These winds in excess of 60 mph could lead to downed power lines
and treacherous travel especially for high profile vehicles. Ahead
of the cold front, much above normal temperatures and dry
conditions should continue to combine with the high winds and
create dangerous fire weather conditions through this evening. A
large Critical Risk of fire weather is in place from the Storm
Prediction Center, along with Red Flag Warnings widespread across
the Plains toward the Mississippi Valley. High Wind Warnings and
Wind Advisories are also in effect for many areas. The fire
weather threat is expected to shift into Southern California, the
Southwest, and the Southern High Plains on Tuesday ahead of the
cold front.

As the cold front moves into the Ohio/Tennessee/Lower Mississippi
Valleys on Tuesday, moisture return from the Gulf of Mexico is
expected as a warm front slowly lifts north into the Southeast.
The moisture will help fuel showers and thunderstorms along and
ahead of the cold front from the Ark-La-Tex north and eastward.
With a couple of inches of rain possible, and considering that
portions of the Lower Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys saw
flooding just a few days ago and streamflows and soil moisture
remain much above normal, a Slight Risk of flash flooding is in
place for portions of southern Arkansas, northern Mississippi, and
western Tennessee Tuesday into Tuesday night. Rain and
thunderstorms are forecast to spread toward the Eastern Seaboard
on Wednesday as the front moves east, with localized flooding
possible. Some severe weather cannot be ruled out with these
thunderstorms, and currently the Storm Prediction Center has
Marginal Risks outlooked for Tuesday and Wednesday.

Elsewhere, some snow is expected for the Northern and Central
Rockies through Tuesday just behind the lead cold front and also
in the vicinity of a secondary cold front. Most areas should see
light amounts of snow, though 4+ inches of snow is possible in the
higher terrain of the Central Rockies, and snow combined with
gusty winds could lead to reduced visibility. The Northeast could
experience some gusty winds through this evening, but winds are
already lessening and should continue to do so over the next few
hours.

Above normal temperatures in the central U.S. today will give way
to temperatures 10-20 degrees below average Tuesday and Wednesday
as the cold front sweeps through. Ahead of the front, warm
temperatures can be expected for the East through midweek, while
the West Coast sees a warming trend as well.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR SOUTHEAST NEW MEXICO AND SOUTHWEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough, currently noted in water-vapor imagery over
the northwestern CONUS, will shift east over the next 24 hours into
the central Plains with broad upper-level ridging expected over the
West Coast. The evolution of this upper-level pattern will favor
surface pressure falls across the far southern High Plains ahead of
a southeastward surging cold front as well as building surface high
pressure over the Great Basin. The resulting windy conditions will
introduce fire weather concerns for portions of the southern High
Plains, the central Plains, and portions of California.

...Southern High Plains...
Elevated to critical fire weather conditions appear likely again
this afternoon as winds increase to around 15-25 mph amid modest
surface pressure falls over the region. Strengthening southwesterly
mid and upper-level flow coupled with deep boundary-layer mixing by
late afternoon will support wind gusts up to 30-35 mph. A
considerable westerly wind component over the southern Rockies will
favor downslope warming/drying and foster RH values falling well
below 15% over the region. Recent fuel analyses continue to show
dry, receptive fuels (which were likely exacerbated by Monday's dry,
windy conditions). As such, critical fire weather conditions are
expected again today within a broader zone of elevated conditions.

...Central Plains...
Morning observations show a very dry post-frontal air mass
(featuring dewpoints in the low single digits) upstream from the
broader NE region. Building surface high pressure over the Northwest
this afternoon will help maintain pressure gradient winds as the dry
air advects into the region. Clear skies will allow for sufficient
diurnal warming for RH values to fall into the 20-25% range.
Coincidentally, deep boundary-layer mixing and a uni-directional
wind profile will allow for efficient downward transfer of stronger
flow aloft, which could manifest at the surface as wind gusts up to
35-40 mph. Fine fuels across this region remain receptive after the
recent dry frontal passage on Monday afternoon. Elevated fire
weather conditions appear most likely over central NE, but may
extend into adjacent portions of SD and KS.

...California...
Building surface high pressure over the Northwest/northern Great
Basin will augment the offshore pressure gradient across coastal
southern CA as well as northerly flow through the Sacramento Valley.
For coastal southern CA, northeast winds are forecast to increase
through the morning and should peak this evening into early
Wednesday morning with sustained winds between 20-30 mph. Wind gusts
up to 35-55 mph are possible, especially in the more wind prone
locations along the coastal mountains and hills. Strong downslope
warming and drying will help RH values fall into the single digits
for some locations. Fuel analyses and reports continue to suggest
that fuels are generally not yet receptive across this region, but
pockets of drier fuels will support an elevated fire weather
concern.

Further north across the Sacramento Valley, diurnal heating and
falling RH into the 15-20% range, coupled with breezy northerly
winds, will support areas of elevated fire weather conditions.
Despite somewhat weaker mid-level flow compared to locations further
south, wind gusts up to 20-25 mph will be possible during peak
daytime heating.

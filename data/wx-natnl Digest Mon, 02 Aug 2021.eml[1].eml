Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021

Valid 011700Z - 021200Z

An area delineating potential for isolated dry thunderstorms has
been introduced for parts of northern California and southwest
Oregon. Visible satellite shows mostly clear skies over this region,
which should allow for strong insolation and diurnally driven
convective development this afternoon. Peripheral lightning
ignitions will be possible again today outside of predominately wet
thunderstorm cores.

Otherwise, the balance of the previous forecast remains on track.
See the discussion below for more details.

..Karstens.. 08/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0102 AM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
Fire weather concerns will primarily be limited to northern Montana
today as a weak upper-level impulse continues to shift northward
through the Pacific Northwest. Showers and thunderstorms will
continue to overspread eastern WA/OR and much of ID, and while
wetting rainfall seems likely, a few dry lightning strikes are
possible. Conditions will generally remain dry along much of the
West Coast, but weak winds are expected outside of terrain-favored
locations due to a nebulous surface pressure pattern and modest flow
aloft.

...Northern Montana...
An east-to-west pressure gradient over the northern Plains will
continue to filter dry continental air into central MT today with RH
values in the teens to low 20s expected. East/southeasterly winds
are forecast to increase to near 15 mph as a diurnal mixing deepens
through the day. Modest boundary-layer flow will limit the potential
for critical conditions, though occasional gusts up to 20-25 mph are
possible. ERCs remain above the 90th percentile across the region
and will support elevated fire weather conditions.

...Pacific Northwest...
Early morning thunderstorms will likely persist for much of the day
across the Pacific Northwest as the upper-level impulse meanders
north. Regional soundings show an increase in PWAT values over the
past 24 hours due to the northward advection of deeper monsoonal
moisture. This trend will continue and increase the potential for
wetting rainfall - especially through northern ID where latest
ensemble guidance shows high probability for 0.1+ inches of
rainfall. Mostly wet thunderstorms are expected for northern
ID/eastern WA where fuels remain dry, but a few dry lightning
strikes are possible with the initial onset of thunderstorms and
outside of the heavier precipitation cores. A few dry strikes are
also possible along and immediately east of the Cascades where weak
lift and meager instability may support a thunderstorm or two. While
lightning strikes over dry fuels will be a concern, the threat for
widespread dry thunderstorms appears too low to warrant highlights.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0139 PM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

The previous forecast remains on track. See the discussion below for
more details.

..Karstens.. 08/01/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0149 AM CDT Sun Aug 01 2021/

...Synopsis...
The fire weather potential will generally be low for Monday thanks
to continued rain chances and weak flow at the surface. A few
regional fire weather concerns may evolve (as outlined below), but
confidence in these scenarios is too low to warrant risk areas.

...Central Montana...
A weak surface trough is forecast to shift from the Pacific
Northwest to the northern Rockies by Monday afternoon. This will
maintain dry east/southeasterly winds over the state, which should
result in RH values once again falling into the low 20s and perhaps
high teens. However, The synoptic pressure gradient is forecast to
weaken as a surface high over the northern MS River Valley shifts
east through the day. Consequently, the potential for widespread
sustained winds near or above 15 mph appears low. Elevated fire
weather conditions are possible if winds trend stronger than
currently expected.

...Central Oregon...
While some mid-level drying is expected through the day Monday,
forecast soundings suggest sufficient monsoonal moisture will remain
in place to support modest (around 250-500 MUCAPE) instability.
Thunderstorm chances will increase through the day as lift from an
approaching shortwave trough overspreads the region. PWAT values
generally above 0.75 inches and ensemble QPF guidance suggest mainly
wet thunderstorms are probable, though a dry storm or two is
possible on the periphery of the exiting moisture. One additional
mitigating factor is the potential for wetting rainfall over the
next 24 hours, which may reduce fuel receptiveness by Monday
afternoon. As such, the dry thunderstorm threat will be conditional
on 1) sufficient mid-level drying and 2) minimal rainfall today
(Sunday) over central OR.

...Heavy rainfall threat for parts of the South and the Southeast
Wednesday...

...Overview...

During the extended period, the eastern U.S. will remain in a
trough as ridging persists over the Atlantic Ocean and along the
Rockies. This favors a quasi-stationary boundary astride the East
Coast with embedded areas of low pressure that will promote bouts
of rainfall across especially the Carolinas, but also up the coast
to New England. Accumulating rainfall during the course of the
extended period will likely be several inches for North and South
Carolina. On the West Coast, a Pacific system will gradually move
inland over Washington and Oregon by the end of the week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest guidance and their ensemble means continue to have a
good handle on the overall pattern, with typical model spread
noted by the end of the extended period. Maintained continuity by
utilizing a combination of the ECWMF, GFS, CMC and UKMET initially
then increased weighting of the ECWMF ensemble and GEFS mean day 5
through 7. Models continue to suggest increased coverage of
showers across northern Idaho with a stronger system moving into
portions of northern California/southern Oregon

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

With a frontal boundary stalled nearby, the coastal areas of the
Carolinas will have daily showers rainfall resulting in several
inches of rainfall. Chances for rainfall will be slow to decrease
across this area as there will be ample moisture streaming from
the Atlantic into the region. Along this boundary, particularly
across the central and western Gulf, the coverage of convection
will be more scattered but may be more enhanced over New Mexico
and southeastern Arizona as mid-level energy meanders over the
area. Over the Northwest, lead-in and Pacific system will bring in
some light rain to the northern Rockies and coastal Washington,
respectively, as the upper trough and surface front into WA/OR
move ashore.

Temperatures will be within a few degrees of normal over much of
the West but will begin to cool as the Pacific front moves ashore
the Pacific Northwest. Areas along the Canadian border from
eastern Montana to the western Great Lakes will likely see
temperatures 5 to 10 degrees above normal under upper ridging.
Much of the East/Southeast will see near to below normal max
temperatures along and behind the cold front--perhaps as much as
10 degrees below normal on some days over Texas/New Mexico and
over the Carolinas. Low temperatures will be closer to normal in
the Southeast owing to cloud cover but perhaps a few degrees below
normal in the mid-Mississippi Valley where skies will be clearer.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun August 01 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

...A cooler than normal temperature regime is expected to engulf
much of the eastern half of the Lower 48 the first half of the
week, while temperatures gradually heat up along the West Coast...

...Daily rounds of showers and thunderstorms to become a common
occurrence across the Deep South and Southeast this week...

...More rounds of monsoonal moisture expected across the interior
western U.S. with flash flooding possible from the Great Basin to
the Rockies...

The first few days of August start off on a generally cooler than
normal note thanks in large part to a deep upper level trough
setting up shop over the eastern third of the CONUS. A cold front
gradually pushing its way through the South is ushering in cooler
temperatures, but it is also responsible for triggering scattered
showers and thunderstorms this afternoon. Some thunderstorms may
be severe, most notably in the Carolinas where a Severe
Thunderstorm Watch is in effect this afternoon. Ahead of the
front, one more day of sultry conditions is on tap along the Gulf
Coast Sunday before the front arrives on Monday. The front will
have widespread showers and thunderstorms accompanying it, which
will in turn help to drop temperatures to more seasonal levels. By
Tuesday, the front becomes quasi-stationary and a wave of low
pressure looks to form near the Carolina coastline, causing
easterly flow to develop and force temperatures to remain at below
normal levels in the Southeast. This front becomes the focus for
daily episodes of showers and thunderstorms that is forecast to
produce heavy rainfall totals later in the week.

Farther north, a reinforcing cold front is sparking showers and
thunderstorms across the interior Northeast this afternoon. These
storms will track east across the region this evening with
damaging winds, hail, and flash flooding possible within the more
intense storms. In wake of this frontal passage, a cool and dry
air mass across the northern Plains will be ushered into the Great
Lakes and the Northeast begin the new work week. Over the
Mid-Atlantic region however, the front is forecast to stall late
Monday into Tuesday, which will encourage showers and
thunderstorms to stick around along the coast. More showers and
thunderstorms are expected all the way down into Florida and along
the Gulf Coast where the front is forecast to stall out.

In the Pacific Northwest, an influx of monsoonal moisture from the
south should help cool down the temperatures today across the
interior sections, breaking the recent spell of excessive heat.
However, there is no shortage of monsoonal moisture across the
Intermountain West. The associated rainfall is a welcome sight to
the drought-stricken West, but downpours associated with some
thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates that
could trigger areas of flash flooding. Locations most at risk for
flash flooding are where antecedent soil conditions are overly
saturated or near burn scars. The Excessive Rainfall threat in
Idaho and the southern High Plains this afternoon becomes more
focused along the spine of the Rockies on Monday. By Tuesday, the
Excessive Rainfall threat diminishes in the Northwest, but a
Slight Risk remains in place in the portions of Colorado and New
Mexico. In addition, hotter conditions return up and down the West
Coast on Tuesday.

Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for portions of the interior
Northwest, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and the upper Midwest due
to smoke associated with wildfires over western North America
being transported into these areas.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1251 AM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Early-morning water vapor imagery shows a low-amplitude wave off the
California coast that is forecast to shift into the Pacific
Northwest over the next 24 hours. Residual monsoonal moisture will
support enough instability for isolated thunderstorms across central
OR this afternoon. Elsewhere, localized fire weather concerns are
possible across northern California and central Montana, but modest
flow will limit the overall threat.

...Central to Southeast Oregon...
The 00z Boise, ID sounding and GOES PWAT estimates show plentiful
moisture in place across the Pacific Northwest early this morning.
PWAT values will diminish through the day as drier Pacific air,
noted in low/mid-level water vapor imagery attendant to the
upper-level wave, filters into the region. However, forecast
soundings remain in good agreement that residual moisture will be
sufficient for 250-500 J/kg MUCAPE by this afternoon. Lift ahead of
the wave will support isolated thunderstorm development this
afternoon amid peak daytime heating. Deep, well-mixed boundary
layers will not only limit rainfall amounts, but may allow for
strong downburst winds (see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for
details). MRMS estimates show much of central/southeast OR has
missed out on appreciable rainfall over the past 72 hours, which has
maintained dry fuels. While a mix of wet and dry thunderstorms is
expected, the potential for several lightning strikes over dry fuels
warrants the dry thunderstorm risk area.

...Northern California...
Mid-level flow is expected to increase somewhat with the passage of
the shortwave trough over northern CA and southern OR. While surface
pressure-gradient winds will remain weak, a few locations will
likely see wind gusts up to 15-20 mph this afternoon when diurnal
mixing is maximized. With RH values in the teens expected, periodic
and localized elevated fire weather conditions are possible.

...Central Montana...
A lee surface trough is forecast to gradually deepen through the day
as an upper-level impulse progresses over the northern Rockies. The
surface mass response will be modest owing to the low-amplitude
nature of the impulse and associated flow aloft, which will limit
the potential for sustained winds over 15 mph. However, sustained
winds between 10-15 mph may gust upwards of 20 mph across central MT
where fuels are dry and RH values in the 15-25% range are expected.
This idea of localized/transient elevated fire weather conditions is
supported by recent ensemble guidance, though highlights may be
needed if winds trend stronger than expected.

...Lingering heavy rainfall threat for the coastal Carolinas
Thursday...

...Overview...

Upper pattern will undergo a reshuffling of the anomaly centers
from the Pacific across CONUS into the western Atlantic later this
week into next week. Initial trough/ridge/trough pattern over the
PacNW/Rockies/Great Lakes and Midwest will shift toward broad
troughing from the northern Rockies to the Upper Midwest with
weaker ridging into the East. This translates to a generally drier
pattern with warming temperatures out of the Plains into the East.
The Northwest will see cooler and unsettled weather overall.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Through the 12Z/18Z cycle, models and ensembles showed good
clustering to start, but then drifted apart one-by-one from Friday
onward. The UKMET was first to depart from otherwise good
agreement in the West (stronger than most other guidance) and East
(slower than most). The GFS became farther south in the PacNW with
the incoming upper low late Fri into Sat vs the ECMWF/Canadian
which were farther north in southern BC (which has had good
continuity). Favored the ECMWF/Canadian as the pattern unfolded
into quasi-zonal flow but increased ensemble weighting from both
the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble mean to account for increased
uncertainty in an inherently more unpredictable pattern.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Stalled frontal boundary over the Carolinas and along the East
Coast will slowly dissipate this coming weekend, after likely
being a focus for several days of widespread rain and locally
heavy amounts that could cause flooding issues. Upper trough
responsible for its orientation will weaken in concert, allowing
the focused rainfall to abate. With increased flow across the
U.S./Canadian border, rainfall will expand out of the
PacNW/northern Rockies through the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes
as a system traverses the northern tier. Rainfall will focus near
and north of an area of low pressure as well as south of a
northern stream boundary. Rainfall in the Southwest will be more
isolated this weekend but could increase a bit next week as the
upper high shifts away and weak troughing settles into California
and Nevada.

Temperatures will trend cooler as the Pacific front moves ashore
the Pacific Northwest Friday--about 5-15 degrees cooler than
normal. Ahead of the front, temperatures will be 5 to 10 degrees
above normal over the Plains Thu/Fri then into the Corn Belt/Great
Lakes this weekend and to the East Coast by next Monday. Much of
the East/Southeast will see near to below normal max temperatures
along and behind the stationary front--perhaps as much as 10
degrees below normal on some days over Texas/New Mexico and over
the Carolinas Thu-Fri before a warm-up this weekend back toward
more typical values.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0152 AM CDT Mon Aug 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
An upper-level shortwave trough, currently off the California coast,
will consolidate as it moves inland and bring another round of
thunderstorm chances to the Pacific Northwest. Despite the deepening
wave, surface pressure patterns will remain nebulous and result in
generally modest flow. While no robust or widespread wind-driven
fire weather threats are expected, a few regional concerns may
evolve.

...Pacific Northwest...
Forecast soundings suggest enough residual mid-level moisture will
remain in place over the Pacific Northwest to support weak, but
sufficient, instability for thunderstorms Tuesday afternoon. PWAT
amounts near 0.75 inches are expected, but deep, well-mixed boundary
layers could limit rainfall amounts and yield a mix of wet and dry
storms. Additionally, fast storm motions (near 20 knots) may limit
precipitation over any one area. Recent reports suggest fuels remain
dry over central OR, which should support the potential for
lightning starts Tuesday afternoon barring wetting rainfall over the
next 24 hours (though the coverage of rain today/Monday is
uncertain).

...Northern California...
Isolated elevated fire weather conditions are possible Tuesday
afternoon across northern CA into far southern OR as mid-level winds
gradually strengthen in response to the passing upper-level wave.
Although the wave is forecast to deepen to some degree, the surface
response will be modest with most ensemble members showing winds
between 10-15 mph. However, deeper boundary-layer mixing by late
afternoon may allow for occasional gusts up to 20 mph. Warm/dry
conditions will foster RH reductions to the teens and low 20s,
which, when combined with the aforementioned winds, may support
localized elevated conditions.

...Showers and thunderstorms linger along the Coast Coast and
Southeast as threat of heavy rain increases near the Carolina
coasts...

...Monsoonal rainfall gradually shifts eastward from the
Intermountain West to the spine of the Rockies...

...A cool regime is expected to dominate much of the central and
eastern U.S. as heat returns for the interior Northwest and
northern Plains...

A broad upper level trough settling across the central to eastern
U.S. will provide an extended period of cool and dry condition for
much of these areas today.  Meanwhile, the recent oppressive heat
across the Deep South will be cooled by more numerous showers and
thunderstorms today as a cold front slowly edges in from the
north.  The front is forecast to reach the Gulf Coast on Tuesday
and then becomes nearly stationary.  This will allow the showers
and thunderstorms to linger along the Gulf Coast into Wednesday.
Episodes of heavier rainfall can also be expected as low pressure
waves form and travel along the stationary front.  Meanwhile, the
low pressure waves are forecast to interact with the upper trough
as they reach the southeast U.S. on Tuesday.  This regime will
allow the threat of heavy rain to increase near the Carolina
coasts later on Tuesday into Wednesday as the influx of Atlantic
moisture increases and being lifted along the coastal stationary
front.

Farther north, a reinforcing cold front is sparking showers and
thunderstorms across the interior Northeast this afternoon. These
storms will track east across the region this evening with
damaging winds, hail, and flash flooding possible within the more
intense storms. In wake of this frontal passage, a cool and dry
air mass across the northern Plains will be ushered into the Great
Lakes and the Northeast begin the new work week. Over the
Mid-Atlantic region however, the front is forecast to stall late
Monday into Tuesday, which will encourage showers and
thunderstorms to stick around along the coast. More showers and
thunderstorms are expected all the way down into Florida and along
the Gulf Coast where the front is forecast to stall out.

In the Pacific Northwest, an influx of monsoonal moisture from the
south should help cool down the temperatures today across the
interior sections, breaking the recent spell of excessive heat.
However, there is no shortage of monsoonal moisture across the
Intermountain West. The associated rainfall is a welcome sight to
the drought-stricken West, but downpours associated with some
thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates that
could trigger areas of flash flooding. Locations most at risk for
flash flooding are where antecedent soil conditions are overly
saturated or near burn scars. The Excessive Rainfall threat in
Idaho and the southern High Plains this afternoon becomes more
focused along the spine of the Rockies on Monday. By Tuesday, the
Excessive Rainfall threat diminishes in the Northwest, but a
Slight Risk remains in place in the portions of Colorado and New
Mexico. In addition, hotter conditions return up and down the West
Coast on Tuesday.

Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for portions of the interior
Northwest, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, and the upper Midwest due
to smoke associated with wildfires over western North America
being transported into these areas.

Some enhanced rainfall could push further inland across the
central and southern Appalachians by Tuesday.  Meanwhile, the
chance of showers and thunderstorms will increase farther south
into Florida over the next couple of days.

In the western U.S., monsoonal rainfall has been a welcome sight
to bring some relief to the drought, but downpours associated with
some thunderstorms are capable of producing heavy rainfall rates
that could trigger areas of flash flooding.  Locations most at
risk for flash flooding are where antecedent soil conditions are
overly saturated or near burn scars.  Over the next couple of
days, the focus of the monsoonal rainfall is forecast to gradually
shift from the Intermountain/Great Basin region eastward to mainly
along the spine of the Rockies as an upper ridge re-establishes
over the Desert Southwest.  By Wednesday, the monsoonal rain
should be confined to the vicinity of the central and southern
Rockies.  The drying trend along the West Coast will allow the
heat to return for the interior sections on Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1145 AM CDT Sat May 08 2021

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF NEW MEXICO...

Very minor adjustments were made to the Sacramento Valley
Elevated/Critical highlights to adjust for the latest guidance
consensus. Elevated to Critical surface winds/RH are already present
across parts of the Sacramento Valley based on the latest METAR
observations. With visible satellite showing clear skies along the
West Coast, continued uninhibited boundary-layer mixing is expected,
with RH likely dropping to 15% in spots. As such, Elevated to
Critical conditions are expected to continue across portions of the
Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys into the Bay Area through the
afternoon hours.

Elevated to Critical conditions are also being observed across parts
of the Lower Colorado River Basin into the southern High Plains per
latest METAR observations. Clear skies/boundary-layer heating and
the deepening of a surface low across the central High Plains will
encourage further low-level drying and strengthening of the surface
wind field. Latest guidance continues to suggest overlapping
widespread 25+ mph sustained westerly winds and 5-15% RH taking
shape behind a sharpening dryline, hence the maintenance of the
Elevated/Critical areas. A couple areas may also briefly experience
locally Extremely Critical meteorological conditions. Up to high-end
Critical conditions may be observed east of the current
Elevated/Critical delineations across the Texas Panhandle, but
mediocre fuel receptiveness given green-up and recent rainfall
precludes the eastward expansion of fire weather highlights.

Similarly, Elevated meteorological conditions are expected across
portions of the Eastern Seaboard (mainly North Carolina) this
afternoon. However, the impacts on fuels from yesterday's rainfall
are expected to limit the wildfire spread threat to a degree, with
no highlights introduced.

..Squitieri.. 05/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0205 AM CDT Sat May 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A deep upper trough over the eastern CONUS is forecast to move
eastward today, as an upstream trough over the West shifts eastward
into portions of the Plains by tonight. A surface low is forecast to
deepen and move eastward across parts of the central/southern
Plains, while a surface ridge remains in place over the eastern
Pacific into the Northwest and parts of the Great Basin.

...Northern California...
A strengthening surface pressure gradient, in conjunction with
increasing deep-layer northwesterly flow, will result in the
development of strong northerly winds across portions of northern CA
this morning and continuing through the day, particularly in and
near the Sacramento Valley and into portions of the Bay Area. With
very warm and dry conditions expected, the increasing winds will
result in a critical fire weather threat. Critical conditions may
develop as soon as early/mid morning across terrain-favored areas,
and by late morning across much of the Sacramento Valley. Conditions
will likely peak this afternoon, with sustained winds of 20-25 mph
(with higher gusts) expected concurrent with minimum RH values of
5-15%. Critical conditions may persist through much of the evening,
with poor overnight RH recovery.

...Southwest into the southern High Plains...
As the primary surface low and attendant dryline moves east into the
southern Plains, widespread critical (and locally extreme)
meteorological conditions are expected to develop across much of NM
into west TX and the OK/TX Panhandles. During the peak of the event
this afternoon, sustained winds of 20-30 mph (with higher gusts) are
expected in conjunction with minimum RH values of 3-15%.

Fuels are not particularly favorable across the region, and some
areas received rainfall on Friday. While this will temper the threat
to some extent, the presence of high-end critical to locally extreme
wind/RH, along with the potential for holdover fires from lightning
activity on Friday, justifies maintaining a large critical
delineation for much of NM.

...Carolinas...
Relatively dry and breezy conditions are expected across northern
parts of SC into much of NC this afternoon. Sustained winds of 15-20
mph in conjunction with minimum RH values of 20-30% will result in
elevated meteorological conditions. While ERC values had been
running rather high across portions of NC, substantial rainfall over
the last couple of days casts doubt on fuel receptivity across the
region. No elevated delineation has been made at this time, but the
potential will be reassessed in the Day 1 update.

...Overview...

Expect a moderately progressive upper pattern over the lower 48
during the period.  A Great Lakes/Northeast upper trough will
depart after midweek, followed by a trough emerging from the
Rockies and likely reaching near the East Coast by next Saturday.
A trailing upper ridge will cross the West mid-late week.  By
early next weekend the ridge is likely to be over the Plains while
an amplifying trough arrives at the West Coast.  Central
Rockies/High Plains precipitation associated with the initial
upper trough and low-level upslope flow will be trending lighter
Tuesday but chilly temperatures will remain before a moderating
trend.  Progression of the upper trough and interaction with a
front over or just south of the Gulf Coast region should promote
rain/thunderstorms over the South with some heavy activity
possible.  Some of this moisture may extend farther
north/northeast after midweek but with uncertainty in
amounts/coverage.  The trailing upper ridge will bring a brief
period of warmth to the West followed by a return back toward
normal readings as the next upper trough reaches the West Coast.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Most guidance has been finding a way to achieve a similar
trough-ridge-trough configuration for the upper pattern by the end
of the period next Saturday but the embedded details vary and
there is continued divergence for the eastern U.S./western
Atlantic surface pattern after midweek.

From the Rockies eastward, combined details of the departing
Northeast trough and specifics of the upstream trough emerging
from the Rockies differ enough to produce widely different
evolutions at the surface.  00Z Canadian held onto more
southwestward elongation of the Northeast trough Tue-Thu (and was
not preferred) while the ECMWF/UKMET and especially GFS were
quicker. Utilized that trio plus a minority ensemble mean
weighting for a starting point. The result is much greater
dominance of surface high pressure over the eastern U.S./western
Atlantic after midweek--in contrast to recent ensemble mean
consensus for a weak wave to track near the Mid-Atlantic/New
England coast.  On the other side of the spectrum recent GFS runs
have been the strongest with this development but there are still
quite a number of ensemble members from each system showing low
pressure just off the East Coast next Fri-Sat. Will maintain a
system with the day shift update amid limited confidence. Upper
pattern should support a system in the vicinity based on a digging
western trough, but it could trend farther offshore.

Near the West Coast, there is still a period of time mid-late week
when models/ensembles suggest a very low-predictability regime
with small-scale shortwaves progressing from the Pacific into
western North America before upper troughing amplifies near the
coast.  Question remains how upstream energy evolves and at what
speed into the West -- which has yet to be resolved. Model spread
continues through the latest runs, so an ensemble consensus was
preferred. The 00Z/06Z GFS may have been closest in trough timing,
rather than the much slower ECMWF, but were slower over the East
(via the coastal system) so both models remain a bit suspect.
Blend of the GEFS mean and ECMWF ensemble mean along with
continuity offered a reasonable placeholder until the models can
resolve the upstream flow (perhaps not for a couple days).

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Precipitation over the central Rockies and High Plains should be
tapering off on Tuesday, with some high elevation snow still
possible.  Most of the West will be dry during the period though
the Northwest may begin to see scattered precipitation toward the
end of the week as the upper trough moves in.  Farther east, parts
of the South may see some heavy rainfall as the upper trough
progressing out of the Rockies interacts with a wavy front that
should be over or just south of the Gulf Coast region.
Uncertainty remains over exactly where the highest rainfall totals
will be as the models try to resolve small-scale features atop the
surface front.  The most likely scenario of a frontal wave
ultimately tracking near the East Coast would spread rain of
varying intensity northeastward over the eastern U.S., but
confidence in this evolution is lower than normal.  Early in the
period the upper trough and surface system affecting the Northeast
should produce mainly light precipitation with a little snow
possible in the highest elevations.

Unseasonably cool temperatures will persist over the central
Rockies and parts of the central-southern Plains into Tuesday with
highs up to 20-25F below normal (perhaps not quite near records).
The southern half of the Plains may still see highs 10-20F below
normal on Wednesday but a quick warm-up should bring highs up to
5-10F above normal over central parts of the Plains
Friday-Saturday.  Many other portions of the central/eastern U.S.
will likely see one or more days with temperatures 5-15F below
normal through Wednesday or Thursday, followed by a moderating
trend that should bring readings closer to normal by Saturday.
Meanwhile continue to expect the main emphasis for 10-20F above
normal highs to progress from parts of California and Oregon into
the Great Basin during Tuesday-Friday.  The upper trough nearing
the West Coast should bring readings back toward normal over the
West Coast states by Saturday.

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sat May 08 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.


Analogs to the 5 day mean observed pattern centered 3 days ago (D-3)

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0217 PM CDT Sat May 08 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...

Some west-southwestward expansions were made to the Elevated
highlights across portions of the Lower Colorado River Basin, where
10-20% RH are expected to overlap with 15+ mph sustained
west-southwesterly surface winds for multiple hours tomorrow
afternoon. Locally Critical conditions are possible across portions
of the Lower Colorado River Basin towards the Trans Pecos region in
Texas, though the sparsity of such conditions precludes Critical
highlights at this time.

Critical conditions are still expected across portions of the
Sacramento Valley in northern California, especially during the
morning hours. Some weakening of the surface northerly winds may
occur by late afternoon, though Elevated criteria wind/RH should
persist into the early evening hours. Elevated surface winds/RH are
also possible across portions of the Carolinas into Virginia by
afternoon peak heating tomorrow. However, impacts to fuel
receptiveness by recent rainfall still remain unclear, with Elevated
highlights withheld this forecast.

..Squitieri.. 05/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0206 AM CDT Sat May 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough is forecast to remain in place across much of
the CONUS on Sunday. A surface low is forecast to move quickly
eastward from the mid-MS Valley into the Mid Atlantic by late Sunday
night, as an attendant cold front sweeps through much of the
southern Plains into parts of the Southeast. Further west, a weak
surface low will remain in place across the Southwest, while a
surface ridge will persist from the eastern Pacific into portions of
the Northwest and Great Basin.

...Northern California...
A warm and dry northerly flow regime is forecast to persist across
northern CA on Sunday. While guidance currently suggests that winds
may be slightly weaker compared to D1/Saturday, critical conditions
are still expected to develop early in the day, as sustained winds
remain around 20 mph and RH quickly drops below critical thresholds
by late morning across much of the region after poor overnight
recovery.

...Southwest...
Dry and breezy conditions are again expected across parts of the
Southwest on Sunday, though winds are forecast to generally be
weaker compared to D1/Saturday. Sustained winds of 15-20 mph
(locally higher, with stronger gusts) are forecast from parts of
eastern AZ into the Four Corners region, New Mexico, and far west
TX, in conjunction with critically low RH during the afternoon.
These conditions will result in an elevated fire weather threat,
with some locally critical conditions possible.

...Parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas/Virginia...
Warmer conditions are expected across the Southeast into the Mid
Atlantic on Sunday, as low-level flow shifts to southerly across the
region. While a gradual increase in low-level moisture is expected,
RH values may still drop to near critical thresholds in some areas,
due to warmer temperatures and initially limited Gulf and Atlantic
moisture availability. Elevated meteorological conditions appear
possible across portions of the region, though uncertainty regarding
fuel receptivity precludes any highlights at this time.

has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Lower Missouri Valley through Saturday evening.  The hazards
associated with these severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning,
severe thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Some of
the storms will have a 10% or greater probability of producing
hail two inches or greater over parts of Kansas through Saturday
evening.  The thunderstorms will also produce heavy rain.  The WPC
has issued a Slight risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Central Plains and the Lower Missouri Valley through Sunday
morning.  The hazards associated with the rain are scattered flash
flooding, where urban areas, roads, and small streams are the most
vulnerable.

On Sunday, the severe thunderstorms and heavy rain will move
southeastward to parts of the Southern Plains, Lower Mississippi
Valley, and the Tennessee Valley. The SPC has issued a Slight Risk
of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern Plains and
Lower Mississippi/ Tennessee Valleys.  The main hazards associated
with these severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe
thunderstorm wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Some of the
storms will have a 10% or greater probability of producing hail
two inches or greater over parts of the Southern Plains and Lower
Mississippi Valley. Similarly, the SPC has issued a Slight risk of
excessive rainfall over parts of the Lower Mississippi and
Tennessee Valleys.  The hazards associated with the rain are
scattered flash flooding, where urban areas, roads, and small
streams are the most vulnerable.  Furthermore, the rain will move
into the Ohio Valley overnight Saturday, moving into parts of the
Northeast on Sunday.  The rain will continue over parts of the
Northeast on Monday, while showers and thunderstorms move into
parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday evening.

Meanwhile, snow and lower-elevation rain will develop over the
Northern/Central Rockies underneath an upper-level low from
Saturday into Monday evening.  Additionally, late-season snow is
possible in the Northern High Plains on Saturday evening into
Monday afternoon.  Temperatures under broad upper-level troughing
will be well below average from across the northern tier states to
much of the eastern U.S. today before a warm-up in the Southeast
to Carolinas on Sunday. Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are
in effect for parts of the Upper Great Lakes region into parts of
the Northeast. However, temperatures will be warmer across the
south-central U.S.

A front will push the heat southward on Sunday, with temperatures
in the 100s for South Texas. Warm and dry conditions in the
Southwest/Southern High Plains and interior Northern California
have prompted Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather and Red
Flag Warnings in those areas.

0125 AM CDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 091200Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough positioned over the Northern Rockies will
elongate and become quasi-stationary, resulting in a zonal flow
pattern over much of the central and eastern CONUS, while parts of
the West Coast remain under northwesterly flow aloft. Mid-level flow
throughout this regime will be somewhat enhanced (40-50 kt), with
some strengthening of the flow expected in the West as a jet streak
enters the region. At the surface, a cold front will surge
southeast, from the Southern Plains into the lower Mississippi
Valley. Farther west, relatively clear/dry conditions are expected
to persist.

...Northern California...
Diurnal heating/mixing processes should result in sustained surface
winds of 20 mph, gusting to 25-30 mph (particularly in
terrain-favored regions). Meanwhile, RH values should fall into the
teens amid dry/receptive fuels, resulting in critical fire-weather
potential during the late morning into the afternoon hours. Elevated
fire-weather conditions can be expected in proximity to the critical
area, delineated by slightly weaker surface winds and higher RH
values.

...Southwest...
A broad region of elevated fire-weather conditions should develop as
the marginally enhanced flow aloft mixes toward the surface during
the afternoon. Widespread sustained winds of 10-20 mph can be
expected, with locally higher gusts. RH value will vary across the
region, with relatively higher RH values found across portions of
central Arizona/New Mexico compared to adjacent areas. Fuels remain
receptive to large-fire spread amid prolonged drought conditions.
Locally critical fire-weather conditions are certainly possible, but
this potential appears too localized to include any additional
highlights at this time.

...Parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas/Virginia...
Breezy southerly winds should develop across the region in advance
of the approaching cold front. Despite southerly low-level flow
trajectories, RH values may approach critical thresholds at least
briefly during the afternoon, but these conditions will likely be
too localized/transient to include an elevated area at this time.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0127 AM CDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR WEST-CENTRAL NEW MEXICO AND FAR
EASTERN ARIZONA...

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough and zonal flow pattern is expected to remain
anchored over the central/eastern CONUS, along with moderately
enhanced northwesterly flow situated along the West Coast. Despite
the quasi-stationary pattern, flow aloft within this regime appears
to strengthen somewhat throughout the forecast period. This should
result in a slight uptick in surface winds as compared to Day 1, and
thus, critical fire-weather delineations have been added to each
highlighted region, in addition to converting 40% probabilities to
elevated areas.

...California...
A mid-level jet streak should be located over the region at the
start of the period, associated with enhanced 50-60 kt. This feature
will shift southeast through the day, resulting in weakening flow
aloft. However, winds should remain strong enough to result in
sustained winds of 20-30 mph, with locally higher gusts. Surface
flow appears to take on a more northwesterly/offshore trajectory,
which should result in slightly lower RH values, into the teens and
nearing single digits. Given these conditions amid dry/receptive
fuels, critical fire-weather conditions appear likely.

...Southwest...
An embedded mid-level short-wave trough should approach the region,
and bring with it a zone of enhanced mid-level flow. This should
result in widespread elevated fire-weather conditions characterized
by sustained westerly surface winds of 15-20 mph coincident with RH
values falling into the teens. Within this region, critical
fire-weather conditions are likely to develop where sustained
surface winds of 25-30 mph and RH values fall into the single
digits. The critical area has been confined to the most probable
overlap in the wind/RH/fuels combo, and thus may be subject to
further refinements in later outlooks.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
257 AM EDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 12Z Wed May 12 2021 - 12Z Sun May 16 2021

...Overview...

Within the moderately progressive regime across most of the lower
48 and vicinity, guidance is gradually trending toward better
agreement for a more muted surface reflection associated with
Plains shortwave energy that tracks into the East behind a
departing Northeast trough.  On the other hand the arrival of
yesterday's 00Z ECMWF has ultimately heralded what continues to be
a more chaotic trend for how eastern Pacific shortwave energy may
evolve as it approaches the western U.S.  Some of these
differences may ultimately have an impact on the eastern half of
the country later in the period.  Between these features an upper
ridge will move into the West and then the Plains, bringing well
above normal temperatures to parts of the West in particular.
Southern tier states will see a drying trend after midweek as a
rainfall-focusing front sags southward from the Gulf Coast region.
 Unseasonably chilly temperatures north of this front as of
midweek will moderate with time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest ensemble means and GFS runs have been trending toward the
theme of recent ECMWF/CMC runs that shortwave energy emerging from
the Rockies/Plains will not be sufficiently strong to produce a
defined surface wave near the central/northern East Coast after
midweek.  Current consensus is noticeably more sheared with the
shortwave while it is over the Plains though the feature still
becomes somewhat better organized farther east.  Frontal waviness
now remains confined rather far south, takes longer to organize,
and then tracks much farther offshore once it gains latitude
around Friday-Saturday.  There is still some concern that the
upper trough could produce a little more of a dent in the surface
high pressure near the East Coast but it is hard to argue against
the trends from the past couple days.

In spite of fairly good agreement for a strong upper low/storm
system forecast to reach the Aleutians and Bering Sea during the
latter half of the week, models and ensembles have become more
diverse in handling multiple pieces of eastern Pacific energy that
had recently been forecast to amplify into the West Coast as a
phased trough.  Taken as a whole, the past day of guidance
suggests a significantly increased potential for some degree of
flow separation to take place.  The question is where/when this
separation occurs.  The last two ECMWF runs (three counting the
new 00Z run) pull off an upper low farther west than other models
while the GFS has tended to be the most progressive (and steadily
trending slower), and farthest east with separation (if it
occurs).  Latest CMC/UKMET runs have been between the two
extremes.  The elongated nature of the ECMWF mean reflects the
variance in possible separation.  GEFS/CMC means have remained
more phased for the time being but reflect a slower and more
diffuse trend for the trough.  Teleconnections relative to the
positive height anomaly between Alaska/Hawai'i and negative
anomaly just north of Hudson Bay, the most common features in the
D+8 multi-day mean charts, provide conflicting guidance--which
could explain some of the difficulty guidance is having within
this area.  The exact nature of shortwave energy will eventually
have a significant effect on wave/frontal details to the east of
the Rockies.

The updated forecast started with a 12Z operational model blend
early in the period and then transitioned to about two-thirds
weight of the 18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means with only minority
inclusion of the GFS/ECMWF/CMC by next weekend.  This solution
reflected latest trends over the eastern U.S./western Atlantic
while leading to a conservative adjustment amid the considerable
spread over the eastern Pacific and western U.S.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall near the Gulf
Coast may extend into Wednesday while lighter rain should continue
over parts of the Southeast into Thursday.  Then the southern tier
will see a drier period as the focusing surface front gradually
pushes southward over the Gulf and the Florida Peninsula, with the
latter to see varying intensity of rainfall persist the longest
during the period.  Scattered areas of rainfall may extend from
the northern Rockies through parts of the Plains/Mississippi
Valley ahead of a wavy front that reaches the Plains.  Some of
this activity could eventually extend farther eastward but with
low confidence at this time.

Areas from the central/southern Plains through the Southeast will
see unseasonably cool highs on Wednesday with broad coverage of
minus 10-20F anomalies.  A few locations could challenge daily
records for cool highs.  The Southeast and to a lesser extent
farther back into Texas may still see highs at least 10-15F below
normal on Thursday.  Other portions of the East will likely be
below normal as well but with less extreme anomalies.  A
moderating trend over the South and East should yield temperatures
within a few degrees on either side of normal by next Sunday.  The
upper ridge moving into the West and then the Plains will favor an
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California and
Oregon into the Great Basin with plus 5-10F or so anomalies
extending into the central Rockies/Plains.  An approaching upper
trough should gradually erode this area of warmth but recent
slower/weaker trends for the trough in general plus uncertainty
over the character of the trough suggest a slower and less
pronounced cooling trend.

Short Range Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
356 AM EDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 12Z Sun May 09 2021 - 12Z Tue May 11 2021

...Severe weather and rainfall potentially causing flash flooding
are forecast for the southeastern quadrant of the country...

...Late-season snowfall is likely across the Northern/Central
Rockies and High Plains with much colder than average
temperatures...

...Warm and dry conditions will cause fire danger in the
southwestern U.S. and California...

A low pressure system is forecast to move eastward across the Ohio
Valley and Mid-Atlantic through Monday, while pushing a cold front
slowly southward across the Southern Plains to Southeast. Moisture
flowing into the front's vicinity will lead to widespread rain and
thunderstorms across those areas. Today and tonight, severe
weather is expected from the Southern Plains to the Lower
Mississippi and Tennessee Valleys, and an Enhanced Risk of severe
thunderstorms is in place from the Storm Prediction Center for
tornado, wind, and very large hail threats. Additionally, heavy
rainfall could cause scattered flash floods in those regions.
Rainfall of over an inch is also possible farther north across the
Ohio Valley into Pennsylvania, with notable rain into the
Northeast. Then on Monday, storms should focus a bit farther south
as the front sinks southward. South-central Texas is most likely
to receive severe weather with a Slight Risk in place, but the
Gulf Coast states could also see locally strong storms as well as
isolated flash floods, while in and around North Carolina should
also watch for some strong storms on Monday.

In the northern half of the U.S. underneath broad upper-level
troughing, much below normal temperatures are likely today and
Monday, and these chilly temperatures for May should shift into
portions of the Southern Plains and Tennessee Valley on Monday
behind the potent cold front. The cold temperatures will support
snow across the Northern and Central Rockies, with over a foot
possible in some of the highest elevations. Snow is even falling
in lower elevations of the Northern Plains, which should continue
through this morning. Furthermore, Freeze Warnings and Frost
Advisories are in effect this morning for portions of the Snake
River Valley in Idaho and parts of the Great Lakes region and
Northern Appalachians.

Meanwhile, farther south, temperatures will remain hot in South
Texas, where temperatures over 100 degrees are expected.
California is forecast to be a warm spot as well, with
temperatures around 10 degrees above average over the next couple
of days. Warm and dry conditions for the southwestern tier of the
U.S. has once again led to Elevated to Critical Risks of fire
weather for interior portions of California and into the
Southwest, Southern Rockies, and Southern High Plains today and
Monday.

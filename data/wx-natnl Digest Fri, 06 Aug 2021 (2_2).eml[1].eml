Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0154 AM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 061200Z - 071200Z

...NO CRITICAL AREAS...

...Synopsis...
In the mid levels, a shortwave trough is forecast to move across the
Great Basin and central Rockies through the forecast period. In
response to the trough passage, a surface low and cold front will
move east across the Rockies and into the Great Plains by this
evening. Gusty westerly winds and dry surface conditions in the wake
of the trough will support localized fire weather potential across
the Rockies and Great Basin.

...Western Slope central Rockies and the Central High Plains...
As a mid-level trough approaches from the eastern Great Basin,
southwesterly mid-level flow will begins to increase across the
central Rockies. A cold front will advect a drier airmass across
western Colorado and Wyoming as it progresses eastward through the
day. Hi-res guidance shows widespread surface humidity values below
15% from western Colorado through southern Wyoming and onto the High
Plains. Strong west/southwesterly flow behind the front will be
amplified by increasing mid-level momentum transfer and a deepening
lee low/trough. Surface winds of 15-25 mph with higher gusts appear
likely, supporting favorable meteorological conditions for fire
spread. However, fuels across the region remain mostly unperceptive
for widespread activity given abundant monsoon precipitation over
the last several weeks. As such, coverage of elevated and critical
fire weather conditions will likely remain local in nature and
confined the lower elevations where less precipitation has fallen
over the previous weeks.

...Dry Thunderstorms Central Rockies...
Despite decreasing moisture content, lift from the passing
trough/cold front and heating across the higher terrain should
result in scattered storm development by early afternoon. Model
soundings show well-mixed profiles favorable for dry lightning
strikes across much of the higher terrain of Colorado and Wyoming.
However, fuels in this region remain wetter than normal given recent
precipitation. While dry strikes are expected, fuels are general
unsupportive, and dry thunder probabilities will be withheld.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0158 AM CDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 071200Z - 081200Z

...Synopsis...
As the shortwave trough across the High Plains continues eastward,
shortwave ridging is forecast to temporarily build over the Rockies.
A second shortwave trough is forecast to move onshore through the
day, overspreading the Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies. Dry
and windy conditions may develop in the lee of the Cascades and
northern Rockies, supporting elevated fire weather conditions.

...Northern Rockies/Plains...
As mid-level flow increases ahead of the second shortwave across the
Pacific Northwest, surface flow will trend more westerly as surface
high pressure strengthens over the Great Basin. With downslope
trajectories expected, drying of the airmass is forecast across the
northern Rockies/Plains through the day. Bolstered by the increasing
mid-level flow ahead of the trough, westerly surface winds of 15-20
mph appear likely. Lingering clouds may somewhat limit diurnal RH
minimums, but surface humidity values below 25% will support
elevated fire weather conditions given dry fuels.

...Lee of the Cascades...
As westerly flow increases through the day, gap winds will likely
develop with some potential for stronger flow to spill into the
lower basins. Surface RH values are not forecast to be overly
supportive of fire weather potential given strong marine influences
and mid-level moisture. However, the presence of dry fuels and
strong flow suggests some potential for locally elevated fire
weather conditions through the afternoon.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
302 AM EDT Fri Aug 06 2021

Valid 12Z Mon Aug 09 2021 - 12Z Fri Aug 13 2021

...Overview...

A typical late summer pattern is expected to evolve over the CONUS
during the middle of next week with building heights aloft. The
main storm tracks will skirt the northern Rockies/Plains into the
Upper Midwest/Great Lakes regions with the rest of the country
likely to see a drier weather regime. Temperatures will side
toward above normal for much of the country with some bouts of
excessive heat likely.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The biggest concerns with the latest suite of 12z/18z guidance was
regarding a compact upper low lifting from the northern Rockies to
south central Canada in the beginning of the period, which
eventually gets absorbed into a shortwave dropping south through
Canada mid-week. The 18z GFS remains noticeably faster with the
remainder of the guidance, while the 12z ECMWF and CMC are
slowest, with the 12z UKMET in the middle. There does seem to be a
faster trend with this feature amongst most of the guidance, but
not ready to go as fast as the 18z GFS yet. Opted for a blend of
the 12z UKMET/12z ECMWF and the 12z GFS (which was a bit slower
than its 18z run) which offered a nice middle ground solution and
also worked well with WPC continuity. While it was reasonable
early, the 12z CMC left the pack later in the period to bring a
closed low into the northern Plains so it was excluded from the
blend entirely. Elsewhere, the deterministic guidance showed
fairly good consistency and agreement with the ensembles, although
the typical late period details remain fairly uncertain. For this
reason, WPCs forecast trended towards a 50/50 blend of the
deterministic ECMWF and GFS (12z run) with the ECENS and GEFS
ensemble means by day 7.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A leading shortwave into the Great Lakes will continue rainfall
chances across the northern Ohio Valley into the Great Lakes on
Monday, but should wane some by the middle of the week as the
system lifts into southern Ontario/Quebec. Daily rounds of
convection will likely fire along the trailing cold front (and
another Canadian front following) mid to late week from parts of
the Northeast to the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys. The
shortwave/compact upper low across the Northern Rockies-southern
Canada could also bring rain to locations in the far northern
Plains to Upper Midwest Monday and Tuesday.

Temperatures will be about 5-15 degrees cooler than normal in the
Pacific Northwest and northern Rockies behind the lead cold front
this weekend into Monday with a moderation thereafter. Ahead of
this cold front, temperatures will be 5 to 15 degrees above normal
over the Plains and expanding to the East Coast next week. Heat
and humidity combined will bring heat indices into the low 100s
for many. With little relief expected overnight, excessive heat is
possible most notably from parts of the central/southern
Plains/Mississippi Valley and also parts of the Mid-Atlantic later
in the week.

...Heavy rainfall and the chance for flash flooding continues for
portions of the Southeast along a persistent frontal boundary...

...Showers and severe storms expected from the Northern Plains to
the Midwest today and Saturday...

...Hot in the Plains, poor air quality due to wildfire smoke
continues in the Midwest and Intermountain West...

The Southeast looks to close out the work-week and start the
weekend on a stormy note thanks to a stationary frontal boundary.
Daily episodes of blossoming shower and thunderstorm activity are
expected with storms capable of producing heavy downpours. The
locations forecast to receive the most rainfall through Sunday
morning extend from Florida on north across the eastern Carolinas
and into the Virginia Tidewater. Marginal Risks for Excessive
Rainfall are in place for these aforementioned areas today and
Saturday. The frontal boundary over the Southeast is forecast to
dissipate by Sunday and in doing so, reduces the coverage and
intensity of showers and storms throughout the region to close out
the weekend.

Farther north and west, an upper level disturbance aiding in the
development of a frontal system will track from the northern High
Plains today into the Upper Midwest into Saturday. Marginal Risks
for excessive rainfall and severe weather have been issued for
portions of these regions today with damaging winds, large hail,
and flash flooding possible. By Saturday, the primary wave of low
pressure is forecast to strengthen over the northern Plains with a
more favorable setup for severe weather anticipated in the
Midwest. As a result, the Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Slight Risk for parts of the Midwest for Saturday. Some storms
could also produce excessive rainfall rates and potentially
localized flash flooding.

Temperature-wise, the central High Plains are forecast to witness
abnormally hot conditions with highs reaching the century mark in
some spots. Increasingly warmer and humid conditions return to the
Northeast this weekend while cooler than normal temperatures stick
around in the Southeast thanks to the nearby frontal boundary. In
addition, poor air quality due to wildfire smoke from the West
looks to remain an issue, particularly for portions of Northern
California, the Northwest, the High Plains, and the Midwest. Red
Flag Warnings have been posted for parts of the Intermountain West
due to favorable fire weather conditions today. Mostly dry
conditions are on tap for much of the Southwest and Lower
Mississippi Valley through Saturday night.

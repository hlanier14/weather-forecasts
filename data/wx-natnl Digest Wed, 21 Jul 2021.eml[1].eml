Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1138 AM CDT Tue Jul 20 2021

Valid 201700Z - 211200Z

The previous forecast remains valid with only minor adjustments.
Warm, dry and breezy conditions are expected across portions of
western South Dakota and northeastern Wyoming where elevated
highlights have been extended southward. Locally elevated fire
weather conditions may develop this afternoon across southern
California where surface winds will be enhanced by the development
of a thermal trough. Elsewhere, elevated fire weather conditions are
likely across the West along with isolated lightning strikes. See
the previous discussion for more details.

..Lyons.. 07/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0159 AM CDT Tue Jul 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging across the western U.S. will continue to break down as
a mid-level trough slowly advances across the Pacific Northwest
through the period. Dry and breezy conditions may occur across the
higher elevations in the Pacific Northwest as accompanying modest
mid-level flow overspreads the area, while surface lee troughing and
associated dry and breezy flow will likely develop across parts of
the northern High Plains. Meanwhile, deep-layer ascent with the
Pacific Northwest mid-level trough will encourage thunderstorm
development (atop fuels very receptive to fire spread) across the
northern Rockies.

...Pacific Northwest...
Diurnal heating/mixing will support some downward momentum transport
of the modest mid-level flow in higher terrain areas of the
Cascades/northern Sierra, encouraging lee-side downslope flow. 15
mph sustained westerly winds are expected to overlap 15-20% RH
through the afternoon/evening hours, with Elevated highlights
introduced where the aforementioned surface wind/RH overlap is
expected to occur the longest.

...Northern High Plains...
As lee-troughing persists across the northern High Plains, 15 mph
sustained southeasterly surface winds coinciding with 20-25% RH will
result during the afternoon hours. Elevated highlights have been
introduced given very receptive fuels in place.

...Northern Rockies...
The approaching mid-level trough and diurnal heating will both
encourage scattered to potentially widespread thunderstorm
development across the northern Rockies through the afternoon and
evening hours. Precipitable water values over 1 inch suggest that
strikes will be predominantly wet, despite storms being potentially
high-based. The main motivation for introducing isolated dry
thunderstorm highlights continues to be the critically/record dry
fuels across the region, which may support efficient lightning-based
ignitions with strikes along the periphery of storm cores.

Valid 00Z Wed Jul 21 2021 - 00Z Fri Jul 23 2021

...Midsummer heat found throughout the northern and central
Plains...

...Elevated fire weather concerns continue across the northern
Rockies and northern Great Basin...

...Isolated chances for severe thunderstorms and flash flooding
possible for the Lower Great Lakes and Northeast today...

A persistent, but gradually weakening upper-level ridge over the
central U.S. will provide a continuing stretch of above average
temperatures across the northern and central Plains through at
least midweek. Widespread high temperatures into the upper 90s and
low triple digits are forecast here, which is slightly lower than
what was felt yesterday. These warm temperatures and lack of rain
will likely worsen the ongoing severe to exceptional drought found
throughout the region. Excessive Heat Warnings remain in effect
across eastern Montana.

Farther west, the combination of extreme drought, gusty winds, and
thunderstorms will produce fire weather concerns for the northern
Great Basin and northern Rockies through Thursday. Thunderstorms
ahead of an advancing cold front entering the Pacific Northwest
today are likely to produce little rainfall, but lightning could
reach the dehydrated terrain and spark new wildfires, with drying
expected behind a modified Pacific cold front moving slowly
through the region.

The areas with the greatest chances of seeing summer storms
include the Northeast, Lower Great Lakes, Southeast, and
Southwest.  A cold front crossing the Lower Great Lakes with
thunderstorms in tow are forecast to shift into New England and
coastal sections of the Northeast tonight and Wednesday; some
storms could be severe tonight. For the Southeast and Gulf Coast
States, a lingering frontal boundary bisecting the region will be
the focus for additional rounds of slow-moving thunderstorms today
before lifting slowly northward Wednesday and Thursday.  The main
concern with these storms will be associated with heavy rainfall
and scattered flash flooding tonight, with the threat fading in
coverage and intensity on Wednesday and Thursday.  The Southwest
Monsoon is expected to continue with scattered chances of
thunderstorms through much of this week.  As a result, isolated
instances of flash flooding will remain a possibility between the
Southwest and central Great Basin, especially on Thursday.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat in an active Southwest/Four
Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


1800 UTC Update... The latest 00z/06z guidance for today continues
to show good agreement on the overall long wave pattern for the
medium range period and typical smaller scale differences which
are hard to resolve at this time scale and should become more
clear with time. No major changes were needed to the previous WPC
forecast, which is valid for the same time period. This forecast
cycle used a general blend of the 00z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET with the 06z
GFS for days 3 and 4, with some modest (but still less than
majority) contributions from the 00z ECENS/06z GEFS means by late
period. See the previous discussion below for additional details
on the pattern and associated weather hazards.

Santorelli

Previous Discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...
...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect only modest variations of
a similar theme for the mean pattern.  Upper ridging should remain
centered over the central Rockies/Great Basin into the weekend.  A
separate Gulf of Mexico ridge drifting northwestward may
ultimately merge with the Rockies ridge to yield a high center
over or near the central Plains by next week.  Mean troughing will
likely prevail over the Northeast Pacific and eastern North
America.  Features ejecting from the Pacific trough and rounding
the northern periphery of the ridge will bring a couple fronts
into the northern tier states but with only modest impact on the
persistent heat over the region.  To the south of the initial
upper high, a weak upper low over the southern High Plains/Rockies
along with other impulses should provide occasional enhancement of
monsoonal rainfall over the Four Corners/Southwest and nearby
areas.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Confidence remains above average for the expected large scale
pattern while there are ongoing uncertainties/trends for some of
the medium to smaller scale details that have lower
predictability.  An operational model blend of 12Z/18Z solutions
provided a good representation of consensus Friday into the
weekend.  Guidance has finally converged better for details of the
moderately deep trough over the Northeast on Friday and then
lifting away--ultimately leading to greater progression of the
main surface front into the Atlantic over the past couple days of
runs.  Meanwhile there is an ongoing trend for better defined low
pressure near the southern Mid-Atlantic and/or Southeast coast but
for now there is wide north-south spread (intermediate position
favored at this time).  Consensus has been more stable for the
system crossing central Canada and the trailing front extending
into the northern tier of the U.S.

During the first half of next week there is decent model signal
for an ejecting Pacific shortwave to support a southern Canada
wave that brings another front into the northern Plains.  The
weak/progressive nature of the feature leads to a fair degree of
model spread and run-to-run variability thus far, favoring an
average of 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z/old 00Z ECMWF runs along with the
18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.  The 12Z ECMWF strayed to the fast side
of the envelope (new 00Z run slower like consensus) while the 12Z
CMC was on the slow side.  Meanwhile energy rounding the initial
Rockies ridge will reach the eastern North America mean trough
next week, bringing the associated cold front into the eastern
states while a leading wave/front cross the northeastern quadrant
of the lower 48.  After a lot of spread/variability for the
leading wave in recent days, guidance has lately stabilized upon a
fairly modest depiction but differences persist for specifics.  A
GFS/ECMWF model/mean combination provides reasonable continuity
for the main cold front.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some areas of heavy rainfall will be possible on one or more days
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon.  Currently expect the
best potential for highest totals to be over central Arizona late
this week.  There is still uncertainty over day-to-day specifics
given the low predictability of small scale impulses that will be
important for resolving the location and timing of significant
rainfall.  Some areas will be very sensitive to additional rain
given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Overall expect the
core of greatest deep moisture and best rainfall potential to lift
northwestward early next week.  Elsewhere, an organized area of
rain and thunderstorms should progress from the Upper Midwest
through the Great Lakes and into the East, ahead of a
Canadian/northern tier front and leading wave/frontal system.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Areas of rain
may accompany a wavy frontal system over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast late this week into the weekend while
Florida should see multiple episodes of showers/thunderstorms
during the period.

Northern/central portions of the Plains into the Upper Midwest
will likely see persistent heat through the period with
temperatures 5-15F above normal, including at least isolated
Plains locations reaching 100F on one or more days. Additional
humidity will make temperatures feel even hotter, with heat
indices 105-110 for a few locations. Fronts reaching the northern
tier will provide a little variability from day to day but without
any meaningful cooling trend.  On the other hand the clouds and
rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will tend to keep highs
there 5-15F below normal, with a slight northwestward progression
of coolest anomalies possible by early next week.  The upper
trough over the Northeast late this week into the weekend may keep
highs 5F or more below normal.  Otherwise expect temperatures over
most the East to be within a few degrees on either side of normal.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 20 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is relatively good agreement among models indicating mid-level
high pressure across much of the lower 48, except for the Northeast, which is
anticipated to have mid-level low pressure. Excessive heat continues to be the
primary hazards concern for week-2 across the Northern Rockies, central
contiguous U.S., and the Mid-Atlantic. An occasionally active North American
Monsoon circulation is forecast during week-2, which could support above-
normal
precipitation and possible flooding over parts of the Four Corners region.
Weak
mid-level height anomalies are predicted for Alaska, with near to below normal
heights favored across the western Mainland and near to above normal heights
favored elsewhere across the state. No hazards are anticipated for the state
during the period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Northern and Central Plains,
and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Wed-Thu, Jul 28-29.

Slight risk of excessive heat for portions of the Northern Rockies, Great
Plains, and Mississippi Valley, Wed-Tue, Jul 28-Aug 3.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the Mid-Atlantic, Wed-Fri, Jul 28-
30.

Possible flooding for portions of the Four Corners region.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JULY 23 - TUESDAY JULY 27:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!rb45YoyJ-YzxQJ2ZFO7hTn0UASa9E-OJynbzyvfVtq84XgaMzgUC9SAcwOP7MSJx3cqM8r8Y$

FOR WEDNESDAY JULY 28 - TUESDAY AUGUST 03: The 0z ECMWF, GEFS, and Canadian
ensembles are in relatively good agreement regarding the depiction of mid-
level
amplified ridging across much of the CONUS except across the Northeast, where
troughing is favored. There is better agreement regarding the magnitude and
orientation of the mean week-2 mid-level positive height anomalies (across the
northwestern, central CONUS, and Ohio Valley) between the GEFS and ECMWF,
compared to yesterday. A slight risk (>20% chance) of excessive heat is posted
for parts of the Great Plains, and Mississippi Valley during week-2, where the
reforecast tools indicate a 20% chance or greater of temperatures exceeding
the
85th percentile and 90 Deg F (95 Deg F across southern portions). This
highlighted risk area includes regions further south where the uncalibrated
ECMWF and GEFS ensembles show elevated probabilities of parts of the Southern
Plains experiencing heat index values exceeding 105 Deg F. A moderate risk of
excessive heat (>40% chance) is highlighted for parts of the Northern and
Central Plains, and Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, July 28 to 29, where
the GEFS (ECMWF) Reforecast Tool indicates at least a 40% (30%) chance of
maximum temperatures reaching excessive heat criteria. The GEFS reforecast
tool
indicates at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 95th
percentile, with parts of the Dakotas potentially exceeding 100 Deg F, where a
moderate risk of excessive heat is identified. Triple digit temperatures could
approach record breaking temperatures across some parts of the Dakotas.



Today's 0Z GEFS week-2 ensemble mean shows higher positive mid-level height
anomalies across the upper Midwest that is not in the ECMWF and Canadian
ensemble means. The 6Z GEFS mean, however, does not indicate these higher
anomalies and is more similar to the other models. Both runs of the GEFS
continue to indicate positive mid-level height anomalies extending further
east
than the other models, which translates to a stronger heat signal across the
Mid-Atlantic in the GEFS reforecast tool than the ECMWF reforecast tool.
Despite these model differences, the ECMWF reforecast tool has better
agreement
with the GEFS reforecast tool compared to yesterday regarding the potential
for
excessive heat across the Mid-Atlantic. Therefore, a slight risk of excessive
heat is highlighted for parts of the Mid-Atlantic where the reforecast tools
show at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th
percentile and 95 Deg F. Additionally, the CPC skill weighted heat tool shows
at least a 20% chance of heat index values exceeding the 90th percentile and
triple digits (Deg F) as a result of increased humidity. The 0Z GEFS shows the
possibility of nighttime temperatures across the highlighted region
approaching
or exceeding 80 Deg F.



There continues to be fairly large variation in the models regarding the
location of the mid-level ridge center, its orientation across the West, and
its temporal evolution throughout the period. Models generally show the center
being in a favorable location for enhanced monsoonal moisture at various times
during week-2. The reforecast tools do not indicate 3-day accumulations
exceeding the 85th percentile and half an inch, although uncalibrated model
daily precipitation totals show potential for episodes of enhanced
precipitation, likely associated with localized convection. Although
accumulated precipitation amounts in the model guidance are not supportive of
a
heavy precipitation hazard, localized convection could result in flash
flooding
across the valleys. A possible flood risk area is posted for parts of the Four
Corners region, based on where the uncalibrated GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian
ensemble means show the greatest precipitation totals during the period. Flash
flooding can occur even in areas that do not receive any rain, and be a direct
result of runoff from precipitation upstream.



A low amplitude mid-level pattern is favored for Alaska during week-2 with
troughing in the Bering Sea and across western Mainland Alaska, favoring
increased chances for above normal precipitation across the state.
Precipitation totals over a 3-day period are forecast to be under an inch for
most areas in both reforecast tools, precluding a related hazard from being
designated. Mid-level ridging is predicted for eastern Mainland, favoring
above-normal temperatures for most of the northern half of the Mainland. The
ECMWF reforecast tool indicates at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures
exceeding the 85th percentile from the beginning to middle of the period,
while
the GEFS reforecast tool shows central and northern Mainland exceeding this
threshold for days 8 and 9 (July 28 and 29). However, since temperatures in
the
northern half of Mainland are not anticipated to exceed 85 Deg F and mean
week-2 temperature anomalies are not expected to exceed 4 Deg F, a temperature
hazard is not designated at this time.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue July 20 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 26 - 30 2021

Today's model solutions are in relatively good agreement on the predicted
500-hPa circulation pattern across North America and surrounding regions
during
the 6-10 day period. Most dynamical model solutions forecast above normal
500-hPa heights over the western Aleutians and amplified troughs near the
Bering Sea and over the Gulf of Alaska. A ridge is predicted over central and
eastern Mainland Alaska with positive 500-hPa height anomalies. Over much of
the CONUS an amplified ridge is forecast with positive 500-hPa height
anomalies
from the Northern Rockies eastward to much of the central CONUS and parts of
the eastern CONUS. Downstream, a trough is predicted over the Northeast with
near to below normal 500-hPa heights over the region.

Above normal temperature probabilities are elevated over most of northern and
central Mainland Alaska underneath predicted above normal 500-hPa heights,
while near to below normal temperatures are favored for the Alaska Panhandle
and parts of southwestern Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians, consistent with
the consolidation forecast tool. Above normal temperatures are favored for
parts of the western CONUS and Great Basin expanding eastward to much of the
central and eastern CONUS due to the persistent ridging over the region and
also consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. A predicted trough over
the West Coast, as well as a weakness in the ridge over parts of the
Southwest,
favors enhanced probabilities of near to below normal temperatures over parts
of the Southwest.

Above normal precipitation probabilities are enhanced over the Aleutians and
western Mainland Alaska due to forecast westerly surface flow and potential
storm system development. Below normal precipitation is likely for eastern
Mainland Alaska underneath forecast above normal 500-hPa heights. Below normal
precipitation chances are increased over the Northwest eastward to much of the
central and eastern CONUS due to forecast ridging or surface high pressure
over
the region. The position of the predicted 500-hPa ridge and low-level flow is
favorable for increased monsoonal moisture and above normal precipitation for
much of the Great Basin and parts of the Southwest.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered
on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 8, 30% of Today's
0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of Today's operational 0z
ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered
on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement among the model circulation and temperature forecasts, offset
by
some differences among the precipitation tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 28 - AUG 03, 2021

During the week-2 period, the overall 500-hPa circulation pattern is generally
similar to the 6-10 day period. The temperature probability forecast during
the
week-2 period is very similar to the 6-10 day period except that below normal
temperatures are likely for parts of southwestern Alaska and enhanced
probabilities of below normal temperatures were removed from the Southwest,
consistent with the consolidation forecast tools. The precipitation
probability
forecast is also generally similar to the 6-10 day period with the
probabilities slightly reduced. However, enhanced probabilities of above
normal
precipitation were  expanded across eastern Alaska, consistent with the GEFS
and ECMWF reforecast tools.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 40%
of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: About average, 3 out of 5, due to
good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecast
tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on

..Lyons.. 07/20/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0254 AM CDT Tue Jul 20 2021/

...Synopsis...
Upper ridging will gradually advance eastward towards the Plains
states as a mid-level trough traverses the Pacific Northwest
tomorrow/Wednesday. As 50 kt 500 mb flow overspreads the higher
terrain areas of the Northwest, dry and breezy conditions will
develop, supporting some threat for wildfire-spread. Deep-layer
ascent ahead of the upper trough will encourage the lifting of
mid-level moisture and subsequent development of thunderstorms over
very dry fuels.

...Pacific Northwest...
The stronger mid-level flow will mix downward by peak heating
tomorrow afternoon, supporting Elevated winds/RH in the higher
terrain and to the lee of the Cascades/northern Sierra. While
Elevated highlights have been introduced this outlook at locations
most likely to see favorable overlapping surface winds/RH for
several hours, brief, locally Critical conditions will also be
possible. Critical highlights may be needed in future outlooks if
20+ mph sustained surface winds appear more likely in future
guidance.

...Northern Rockies...
Similar to Day 1, predominantly wet storms are expected during the
afternoon through early overnight hours tomorrow across the northern
Rockies in advance of the approaching trough. Nonetheless, storms
should be relatively high-based, occurring over fuels very receptive
to fire spread. As such, efficient lightning-induced fire starts are
possible, especially if strikes may occur outside of storm cores.

Valid 12Z Fri Jul 23 2021 - 12Z Tue Jul 27 2021

...Locally heavy rainfall threat in an active Southwest/Four
Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


1800 UTC Update... The latest 00z/06z guidance for today continues
to show good agreement on the overall long wave pattern for the
medium range period and typical smaller scale differences which
are hard to resolve at this time scale and should become more
clear with time. No major changes were needed to the previous WPC
forecast, which is valid for the same time period. This forecast
cycle used a general blend of the 00z ECMWF/CMC/UKMET with the 06z
GFS for days 3 and 4, with some modest (but still less than
majority) contributions from the 00z ECENS/06z GEFS means by late
period. See the previous discussion below for additional details
on the pattern and associated weather hazards.

Santorelli

Previous Discussion below issued at 0700 UTC...
...Overview...

During the Friday-Tuesday period expect only modest variations of
a similar theme for the mean pattern.  Upper ridging should remain
centered over the central Rockies/Great Basin into the weekend.  A
separate Gulf of Mexico ridge drifting northwestward may
ultimately merge with the Rockies ridge to yield a high center
over or near the central Plains by next week.  Mean troughing will
likely prevail over the Northeast Pacific and eastern North
America.  Features ejecting from the Pacific trough and rounding
the northern periphery of the ridge will bring a couple fronts
into the northern tier states but with only modest impact on the
persistent heat over the region.  To the south of the initial
upper high, a weak upper low over the southern High Plains/Rockies
along with other impulses should provide occasional enhancement of
monsoonal rainfall over the Four Corners/Southwest and nearby
areas.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Confidence remains above average for the expected large scale
pattern while there are ongoing uncertainties/trends for some of
the medium to smaller scale details that have lower
predictability.  An operational model blend of 12Z/18Z solutions
provided a good representation of consensus Friday into the
weekend.  Guidance has finally converged better for details of the
moderately deep trough over the Northeast on Friday and then
lifting away--ultimately leading to greater progression of the
main surface front into the Atlantic over the past couple days of
runs.  Meanwhile there is an ongoing trend for better defined low
pressure near the southern Mid-Atlantic and/or Southeast coast but
for now there is wide north-south spread (intermediate position
favored at this time).  Consensus has been more stable for the
system crossing central Canada and the trailing front extending
into the northern tier of the U.S.

During the first half of next week there is decent model signal
for an ejecting Pacific shortwave to support a southern Canada
wave that brings another front into the northern Plains.  The
weak/progressive nature of the feature leads to a fair degree of
model spread and run-to-run variability thus far, favoring an
average of 12Z/18Z GFS and 12Z/old 00Z ECMWF runs along with the
18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF means.  The 12Z ECMWF strayed to the fast side
of the envelope (new 00Z run slower like consensus) while the 12Z
CMC was on the slow side.  Meanwhile energy rounding the initial
Rockies ridge will reach the eastern North America mean trough
next week, bringing the associated cold front into the eastern
states while a leading wave/front cross the northeastern quadrant
of the lower 48.  After a lot of spread/variability for the
leading wave in recent days, guidance has lately stabilized upon a
fairly modest depiction but differences persist for specifics.  A
GFS/ECMWF model/mean combination provides reasonable continuity
for the main cold front.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some areas of heavy rainfall will be possible on one or more days
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon.  Currently expect the
best potential for highest totals to be over central Arizona late
this week.  There is still uncertainty over day-to-day specifics
given the low predictability of small scale impulses that will be
important for resolving the location and timing of significant
rainfall.  Some areas will be very sensitive to additional rain
given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Overall expect the
core of greatest deep moisture and best rainfall potential to lift
northwestward early next week.  Elsewhere, an organized area of
rain and thunderstorms should progress from the Upper Midwest
through the Great Lakes and into the East, ahead of a
Canadian/northern tier front and leading wave/frontal system.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Areas of rain
may accompany a wavy frontal system over the southern
Mid-Atlantic/Southeast coast late this week into the weekend while
Florida should see multiple episodes of showers/thunderstorms
during the period.

Northern/central portions of the Plains into the Upper Midwest
will likely see persistent heat through the period with
temperatures 5-15F above normal, including at least isolated
Plains locations reaching 100F on one or more days. Additional
humidity will make temperatures feel even hotter, with heat
indices 105-110 for a few locations. Fronts reaching the northern
tier will provide a little variability from day to day but without
any meaningful cooling trend.  On the other hand the clouds and
rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will tend to keep highs
there 5-15F below normal, with a slight northwestward progression
of coolest anomalies possible by early next week.  The upper
trough over the Northeast late this week into the weekend may keep
highs 5F or more below normal.  Otherwise expect temperatures over
most the East to be within a few degrees on either side of normal.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0123 AM CDT Wed Jul 21 2021

Valid 211200Z - 221200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper ridge will remain centered over the Rockies as a mid-level
trough moves across the Pacific Northwest during the period. Near 50
kt 500 mb flow will overspread the higher terrain areas of the
Pacific Northwest, encouraging some dry and breezy conditions.
Deep-layer ascent and ample moisture ahead of the mid-level trough
will also promote scattered to occasionally widespread thunderstorms
across the Northern Rockies.

...Pacific Northwest...
Afternoon heating/boundary layer mixing will encourage some downward
momentum transport of the stronger flow aloft across the higher
terrain of the Cascades and northern Sierra, with downslope flow
expected along the lee-side of both ranges. 15-20 mph sustained
westerly flow coinciding with 15-20% RH will be common through the
mid and late afternoon hours. Elevated highlights have been
introduced where favorable dry/breezy surface conditions will most
likely overlap receptive fuels for several hours.

...Northern Rockies...
Afternoon heating and large-scale lift of the deep mid-level
moisture (characterized by 1+ inch precipitable water values) will
aid in the development of scattered to numerous thunderstorms across
the Northern Rockies through the afternoon and early overnight
hours. While the higher precipitable water values suggest that
storms will have a larger ratio of wet strikes, dry strikes are
possible on the periphery of storm cores. In addition,  gusty
erratic winds may emanate from the stronger storm cores, potentially
exacerbating fire behavior associated with holdovers or ongoing
active wildfires. Please see the Day 1 Convective Outlook for more
details on the gusty winds/severe threat.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHWEST MONTANA...

...Synopsis...
The upper ridge axis will shift towards the Plains States as the
Pacific Northwest mid-level trough (from Day 1) pivots around the
crest of the upper ridge and traverses the northern Rockies
tomorrow/Thursday. A surface pressure gradient will develop across
Montana as the mid-level trough and associated surface lee trough
progress eastward through the afternoon, bringing about dry and
breezy conditions supporting wildfire spread. Similarly, dry and
breezy conditions may occur once again in proximity to the northern
Sierra as the mid-level trough glances the area to the north.
Deep-layer ascent ahead of the mid-level trough will lift deep
mid-level moisture, encouraging the development of scattered to
numerous thunderstorms over fuels quite receptive to fire spread.

...Northern Rockies...
By afternoon peak heating/boundary-layer mixing, 20+ mph sustained
westerly surface winds are expected to coincide with 15-20% RH for
at least a few hours across western into central Montana, warranting
Critical highlights tomorrow. In proximity to and to the east of the
forecast dry and breezy surface conditions, scattered to widespread
thunderstorms will also develop during the afternoon. Precipitable
water values exceeding 1 inch in spots may result in a higher ratio
of wet strikes. Appreciable rainfall accumulations over the same
areas from recent previous events may also locally dampen fuels in
spots. Nonetheless, fuels are expected to remain highly receptive to
fire spread on a more widespread basis. Dry strikes on the periphery
of relatively fast moving storm cores should still support some
lightning-ignition efficiency, hence the introduction of an isolated
dry thunderstorm area.

...Northern Sierra...
The mid-level trough is expected to amplify enough while traversing
the northern Rockies to overspread modest mid-level flow over the
northern Sierra tomorrow. Across and to the lee of the higher
terrain, 15 mph sustained westerly winds will overlap with 15-20% RH
through the afternoon. As fuels are expected to be at least modestly
receptive to fire spread, Elevated highlights have been introduced.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat through the weekend in an active
Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon pattern...

...Heat will continue over the northern/central Plains into the
Upper Midwest...


...Overview...

The large scale upper pattern will remain fairly similar from the
weekend into the middle of next week but there will be some
adjustments along the way.  Initial ridging aloft that covers the
Great Basin/central Rockies and central/southern Plains should
consolidate into a central Plains ridge likely to strengthen by
midweek with guidance developing/expanding a 594 dm contour at
that time.  This pattern will keep well above normal temperatures
over the central/northern Plains and Upper Midwest through the
period.  To the south of the initial western ridge, moisture and a
compact upper low over Arizona and vicinity will extend the threat
of locally heavy monsoonal rainfall through the weekend.  Then the
consolidation of upper ridging over the Plains should push the
moisture/upper energy to the west and north thereafter, bringing a
lighter trend to rainfall over the Southwest.  Uncertainties over
specifics of how a Northeast Pacific trough/upper low may open up
after the weekend will affect the forecast across southern Canada
and the northern tier U.S. after the weekend.  Mean troughing
should persist over the Northeast, with one shortwave departing
early in the weekend followed by one or more features that should
maintain cyclonic flow on average.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The updated forecast based on 12Z/18Z guidance continues to
reflect a consensus model approach early in the period followed by
a trend to a model/ensemble mean combination.  Details are still
in flux for the surface evolution near the southeastern coast.
Recent trends have led to clustering in the southern half of the
prior spread for initial low pressure (closer to the GFS than
ECMWF from earlier runs).  Latest solutions offer the potential
for a defined surface low to reach into the Gulf of Mexico,
whether from motion of the initial low or by redevelopment, in
contrast to the wave staying near the Southeast coast.  This
cycle's manual forecast attempted a conservative trend by way of a
more extensive trough while awaiting better continuity.  Meanwhile
there are only typical run-to-run adjustments for the frontal
evolution from the northern Plains through the
Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into early next week.
Fast/low amplitude nature of Pacific flow rounding the central
U.S. ridge continues to suggest low predictability for surface
details influenced by this stream.  The signal persists for a wave
to emerge from Montana around the start of the week and then track
into Canada, but the models have not been consistent or agreeable
with the supporting dynamics.  The energy associated with the
northeastern Pacific upper low expected to open up may also come
into play by next Tuesday or Wednesday but again guidance differs
on the strength/timing of the resulting shortwave(s).


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest consensus shows the potential for areas of heavy rainfall
within the Southwest/Four Corners Monsoon to extend into the
weekend and still with central Arizona likely to see the highest
totals from this event.  Some areas will be very sensitive to
additional rain given already wet soil from prior rainfall.  Rain
should trend lighter next week as upper level energy departs and
the core of greatest deep moisture/rainfall lifts northwestward
and becomes more diffuse.  A combination of fronts should bring an
organized area of rain and thunderstorms from the Great Lakes into
the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic during the weekend into next week.
Some rainfall could be locally moderate to heavy.  Another episode
of showers/storms could affect the Upper Midwest/Great Lakes next
week depending on uncertain wave/front details.  Portions of the
Florida Peninsula may see enhanced rainfall to the south of a
surface trough/possible embedded low whose details are very
uncertain at this time.

Expect a hot pattern to continue from the northern/central Plains
into the Upper Midwest through the period with temperatures 5-15F
above normal, including at least isolated Plains locations
reaching 100F on one or more days. Additional humidity will make
temperatures feel even hotter, with heat indices reaching 105-110F
at a few locations in the southern portion of this region. Fronts
reaching the northern tier will provide a little variability from
day to day but without any meaningful cooling trend.  Interior
portions of the Northwest will also see fairly hot conditions but
with anomalies tending to stay in the single digits above normal.
Clouds and rainfall over the Southwest and vicinity will keep
highs there up to 10-15F below normal through the weekend.
Temperatures over the Southwest should trend somewhat closer to
normal next week as the best moisture departs to the northwest.
Most of the eastern U.S. should see near to slightly above normal
readings except for some pockets of below normal highs over New
England during the weekend.

...Severe weather threat found across the Northeast today, with
additional rounds of heavy rain possible over the Southwest
through the end of the week...

...Midsummer heat continues across the northern and central
Plains...

...Elevated to critical fire weather concerns remain throughout
the northern Rockies and northern Great Basin...

A cold front swinging across the Northeast this afternoon will
help spark thunderstorms capable of producing damaging wind gusts
and large hail. The area highlighted as having the greatest severe
thunderstorm threat extends from Cape Cod to the Delmarva
Peninsula. This cold front will also help rid the atmosphere of
wildfire smoke that was recently transported from western North
America. In the meantime, Air Quality Alerts remain in effect for
parts of the Mid-Atlantic. Elsewhere, another day of scattered
showers and thunderstorms is in store for the Southeast and Gulf
Coast region, with isolated downpours possibly leading to
localized flash flooding. Thunderstorms are also possible across
western Montana as a cold front interacts with a warm and unstable
airmass. A few storms could turn severe and trigger damaging wind
gusts.

The Summer Monsoon is expected to persist throughout the Southwest
and central Great Basin for the foreseeable future. This rainfall
is desperately needed for much of the region, as widespread
extreme to exceptional drought has been locked in for much of the
year. However, too much rain could lead to flooding concerns
across vulnerable locations. Showers and thunderstorms capable of
dropping over an inch of rain are expected to become more
widespread by Thursday over portions of the Southwest. A Slight
Risk (level 2/4) of Excessive Rainfall has been issued for both
today and Thursday, including parts of Arizona, western New
Mexico, and southwest Colorado.

Hot and dry weather is forecast to continue across the northern
and central Plains over the next few days as an upper-level ridge
remains anchored over the central Rockies. Widespread high
temperatures into the upper 90s and low triple digits stretch
across eastern Montana and the Dakotas, while spreading farther
south and east by the end of the week. Excessive Heat Warnings
remain in affect across eastern Montana today as warm overnight
lows combine with dangerous heat during the day. Slightly to the
west, extreme drought, gusty winds, and the continuing threat of
dry lighting could create elevated to critical fire weather. These
conditions stretch from the northern Sierra Nevada and Great Basin
to the Northern Rockies, where Fire Weather Watches and Red Flag
Warnings have been issued.

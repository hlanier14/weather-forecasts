Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021

Valid 271700Z - 281200Z

Elevated highlights were added to portions of eastern Wyoming into
western South Dakota and far northwest Nebraska for this afternoon.
The latest METAR observations already show RH dipping below 25%
across parts of eastern Wyoming. With continued unimpeded diurnal
heating (clear skies depicted by recent visible satellite imagery),
boundary layer mixing should promote widespread 15 mph sustained
south-southeasterly winds through the afternoon. RH is expected to
further dip into the 15-20% range by early afternoon, coinciding
with the stronger winds, as suggested by the latest guidance
consensus. Locally Elevated conditions may also occur across far
northern Montana, along the U.S./Canadian border later today.

Otherwise, isolated dry thunderstorm highlights remain in place
across portions of the Pacific Northwest into the northern Great
Basin/Northern Rockies regions. Relatively high-based thunderstorms
are in progress across portions of central and eastern Oregon,
embedded within a broader region of showers and widespread clouds.
As such, lift from diurnal heating and overall buoyancy will likely
remain limited across portions of northern California, Oregon, and
far northwest Nevada through the day. However, clearer skies/greater
diurnal heating is expected to foster additional storm development
later this afternoon/evening across portions of the Northern
Rockies. Though storms are expected to be generally wetter,
critically dry fuels may compensate to support efficient
lightning-induced fire starts to warrant the maintenance of isolated
dry thunderstorm highlights.

..Squitieri.. 07/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge will slowly drift eastward toward the central
Plains today. Thunderstorm activity has been prolific near the
monsoon moisture on the southwest fringe of this upper-level ridge.
Some of this monsoon moisture is advecting northward into the
Pacific Northwest with PWAT values of 1.31 inches on the 00Z MFR
sounding, which is near the daily maximum recorded value for this
RAOB site. Cloud cover limited instability across Oregon on Monday
and kept afternoon thunderstorm activity to a minimum. Expansive
cloud cover is forecast once again on Tuesday across northern
California and eastern Oregon, which could limit convective
coverage. However, with this cloud cover will also come increasing
low-level moisture and therefore, there may not be much heating
required for thunderstorm activity from northern California into
Oregon, especially with a weak shortwave forecast to cross the
region during the afternoon hours.

Farther northeast, less mid-level cloud cover is forecast and thus
surface heating is expected to be sufficient for some afternoon
thunderstorm activity.

Fuels are very dry across the entire Northwest with ERC percentiles
above the 95th percentile and some areas near record fuel dryness.
Therefore, even though some storms may be on the wetter side given
the PWAT values, lighting ignitions are still possible given the dry
fuels.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 27 2021

SYNOPSIS: Todays model solutions feature an end to the excessive heat risk
across the Southern Great Plains and Lower Mississippi Valley by week-2. It
appears that the longwave pattern may return to one that has persisted for
much
of this summer with the focus of excessive heat over the West and the Northern
Great Plains. However, an elevated risk for excessive heat is still favored
over the northwestern CONUS where multiple large wildfires continue to burn
across parts of California, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern Rockies.
Mid-level low pressure over the Bering Sea is likely to result in a continued
wet pattern for western Mainland Alaska, but rainfall amounts are expected to
diminish later in week-2.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat for the Northern Great Plains, Wed-Fri, Aug
4-6.

Slight risk of excessive heat for parts of the western and north-central
CONUS,
Wed-Tue, Aug 4-10.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for western Mainland Alaska, Wed-Thu, Aug
4-5.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JULY 30 - TUESDAY AUGUST 03:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!oFwXRirw_PikG4haSGpdc-073Uo3GHgKLIN8L3iCgow68EloPpV3l_ovOCQCFkhEGHzdV9V5$

FOR WEDNESDAY AUGUST 04 - TUESDAY AUGUST 10: Major changes to yesterdays
week-2 temperature hazards are necessary since an amplifying 500-hPa trough
over eastern North America is forecast to result in a cold front shifting well
south of the 40th parallel by early next week. This cold front is now expected
to end the heat wave across the south-central CONUS prior to week-2.
Therefore,
the slight and moderate risks of excessive heat for this region in yesterdays
outlook are discontinued. The GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools continue to
support at least a slight risk of excessive heat across the Central to
Northern
Great Plains with an expansion to include more of the West in a slight risk
area due to  an increase in 500-hPa heights. Within this broad slight risk
area, the reforecast tools depict that maximum temperatures have a 20 percent
chance of exceeding the 85th percentile of the climatological distribution.
Model solutions are converging on an increased chance of excessive heat across
the Northern Great Plains where the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools have a
40-60 and 20-40 percent chance, respectively, of maximum temperatures
exceeding
the 85th percentile. Given the converging model solutions and ongoing drought
conditions, a moderate risk of excessive heat (maximum temperatures into the
90s) is posted for the Northern Great Plains from Aug 4 to 6.



According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, valid on July 20, extreme (D3) to
exceptional (D4) drought is designated for more than half of Oregon. In
addition to the worsening drought conditions, multiple large wildfires
continue
to burn from Oregon and Washington east to Idaho and western Montana. Also,
the
Dixie wildfire has burned nearly 200,000 acres in Plumas County of northern
California. The predicted above normal temperatures through at least early
August is likely to maintain elevated wildfire danger and further dry fuels
across California, the Pacific Northwest, and the northern Rockies. Prevailing
mid-level flow is likely to spread smoke plumes well eastward and reduce air
quality at times across much of the CONUS.



Since todays ensemble means feature a 500-hPa ridge building back to the west
and becoming centered over the Four Corners region, a return of enhanced
monsoonal moisture is expected later in week-2. If model solutions maintain
good continuity, a flash flooding hazard may be introduced for the Southwest
in
subsequent outlooks.



The GFS ensemble mean continues to indicate very heavy rainfall (3 to 5
inches)
across northwest Mainland Alaska during week-1. Due to the likelihood of this
heavy rainfall during the next week and a continued signal for a wet pattern
into the beginning of week-2, a slight risk of heavy rainfall is posted for
parts of western Mainland Alaska on Aug 4 and 5.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern spreads over
the West...

18Z Update:  Overall, the models and ensemble means are in above
average agreement on the synoptic scale features through at least
Sunday, with an eastern U.S. trough and a central/western U.S.
ridge resulting in a fairly amplified pattern.  For the
fronts/pressures, the CMC becomes a strong outlier with an upper
trough/low over the eastern Pacific, and the 00/06Z runs of the
GFS became more progressive with shortwave energy across the Great
Lakes and Northeast by the weekend when compared to the ensemble
guidance.  For the Friday through Sunday time period, a general
blend of the UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/some CMC was used as a forecast
baseline, and then maintaining some of the GFS/ECMWF along with
their ensemble means for next Monday and Tuesday, while keeping
some previous WPC continuity.  The previous discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance remains consistent and agrees that a strong closed
upper high over the central U.S. will gradually weaken and shift
southward from late this week into next as a ridge extends through
the Rockies and north-central Intermountain West to western
Canada. The northward amplitude and sharpness of the ridge will
likely support an unseasonably deep eastern Canada/U.S. upper
trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting across the West between the
ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific troughing will
promote widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with isolated
local runoff issues. Highest rainfall totals during the five-day
period are likely to be over the Great Basin and northern-central
Rockies where there should also be increasing coverage of daytime
highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand the Pacific Northwest
may see very warm to hot conditions (highs up to 10-15F above
normal), especially Friday-Saturday, before a moderating trend as
heights aloft decline. Some record warm minimum temperature
records will be possible to the west of the Rockies, both within
the warm pattern over the Northwest and elsewhere due to
clouds/moisture. Areas from the southern Plains into Lower
Mississippi Valley will be rather hot, albeit with mostly
single-digit anomalies for daytime highs. Many record warm lows
are also likely across the moist South.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves rounding the aforementioned upper
ridge will dig downstream to amplify the mean upper trough over
the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48. Favorable upper support
may help to produce strong convection and locally heavy downpours
focusing with moisture/instability pooling near wavy fronts that
may become slow moving as they reach the southern periphery of the
mean trough aloft. Convective outflow and reinforcing frontal
surges will act to gradually shift best focused rainfall chances
later this week into next down over the Plains and from the
Mid-MS/TN Valleys to the Carolinas/Southeast, with guidance trends
forcing the main axis of precipitation slightly southward compared
to continuity. The eastern U.S. pattern will be most favorable for
below normal temperatures from the Great Lakes/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where a few locations with shorter periods of record
may approach record low values on Saturday morning.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability Days
3-7. A trend to develop an unseasonably amplified eastern U.S.
upper trough seems reasonable considering the strength of the
upstream ridge. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Friday into the weekend before switching to a blend of the
ECENS/GEFS ensemble means and 18 UTC GFS/12 UTC ECMWF by early
next week. This strategy maintained excellent WPC product
continuity.

The latest 00 UTC GFS/ECMWF maintain good run to run continuity
despite continued differences with shortwaves in the large scale
eastern U.S. upper trough. The blend mitigates these differences.
The 12 UTC UKMET/Canadian were outliers into Sunday-Tuesday by
bringing northeast Pacific upper trough energy more robustly
inland into western Canada than the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means. The 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian have trended in line
with other guidance, bolstering forecast confidence.

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 02 - 06 2021

Todays numerical model solutions from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian forecast
suites depict fairly substantial differences relative to yesterday on the mean
500-hPa height pattern across much of the forecast domain, particularly over
the eastern CONUS. A persistent and anomalously strong closed 500-hPa low is
predicted over the western Bering Sea. A split-flow pattern is predicted
downstream of this closed low, with 500-hPa ridging anticipated across central
and eastern Alaska and troughing forecast farther to the south off the coast
of
the Pacific Northwest. Subtropical ridging is expected to dominate much of the
west-central CONUS during the outlook period. However, this ridge is forecast
to be much weaker over the central and southeastern CONUS relative to that
depicted by yesterdays model solutions. An anomalously strong trough is
expected across the eastern CONUS. The southern extent of this trough is
forecast to push much farther south in todays model solutions relative to
yesterdays. A frontal boundary associated with this trough could potentially
reach the Gulf Coast. The manual 500-hPa height blend, based primarily on the
ensemble means from the GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian models, supports below
normal
heights across much of the eastern CONUS as well as the Aleutians and parts of
the west coast of Mainland Alaska. Near to above normal 500-hPa heights are
expected elsewhere across the forecast domain.

With subtropical ridging expected to dominate much of the western CONUS, above
normal temperatures are favored across the West Coast, the Northern Rockies,
and the Northern Plains. Farther to the south and east, enhanced probabilities
of above normal temperatures are restricted to southern Texas and the Florida
Peninsula due to the trend toward a more expansive trough across eastern North
America relative to yesterday. This trough favors below normal temperatures
across the Northeast and Great Lakes southward and westward to parts of the
Mississippi Valley and Southeast. Above normal temperatures are generally
favored across much of Mainland Alaska ahead of a closed upper level low
forecast over the western Bering Sea.

Above normal precipitation is favored along much of the central and eastern
Gulf Coast region, associated with a mean frontal boundary. Farther to the
north, below normal precipitation is likely from parts of the Northern Plains
eastward to the Northeast and southward to the Tennessee Valley, as a
relatively cool, stable air mass establishes itself behind this mean frontal
boundary. Subtropical ridging is expected to favor below normal precipitation
across parts of Southern Texas. Conversely, residual moisture early in the
period leads to enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation across
parts of the interior West. An active pattern is favored across western Alaska
ahead of the closed upper level low predicted over the western Bering Sea.
Conversely, downstream ridging favors below normal precipitation for parts of
eastern Alaska.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 35% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 5% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on
Day 8, 35% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 10% of
Today's operational 0z ECMWF centered on Day 8, and 15% of Today's 0z Canadian
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Below normal, 2 out of 5 due to a
fairly substantial change among today's model solutions relative to yesterday,
particularly across the eastern CONUS.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR AUG 04 - 10 2021

During the week-2 period, numerical model guidance depicts a generally similar
500-hPa flow pattern to that predicted for the preceding 6-10 day period in
terms of phasing. However, the amplitude of the pattern is much reduced with
weak to slightly positive height anomalies forecast across the entire CONUS. A
strong upper low is forecast to persist well into week-2 over the Bering Sea
continuing an active pattern for western Alaska. Downstream, ridging is
forecast to continue over eastern Alaska and a weak trough is forecast farther
to the south off the coast of the Pacific Northwest. Subtropical ridging close
to climatological strength is predicted across much of the CONUS. A trough is
forecast to persist early in week-2 across the Great Lakes and Northeast and
weaken as time progresses. 500-hPa heights are generally forecast to be near
to
slightly above normal for the period as a whole across most of the CONUS.
Above
normal heights are favored for eastern Alaska while below normal heights are
likely over western Alaska near the persistent upper level low over the Bering
Sea.

The week-2 temperature pattern is expected to be very similar to that
predicted
for the 6-10 day period across Alaska, but fairly large changes are evident
across the CONUS. Above normal temperatures are favored for the western and
north-central CONUS. Near normal temperatures are favored for much of the
eastern and south-central CONUS as a relatively cool airmass forecast during
the 6-10 day period potentially moderates later in week-2. However, cooler
than
normal temperatures remain slightly favored for the Northeast where below
normal temperatures early in the period are most likely. Conversely, above
normal temperatures are favored for much of the Florida Peninsula associated
with subtropical ridging. The temperature pattern for Alaska is forecast to be
similar to the 6-10 day period, with above normal temperatures favored for the
eastern Mainland ahead of the trough forecast over the Bering Sea.

With the persistent upper level low forecast over the Bering Sea, an active
pattern is forecast to continue well into week-2 across western Alaska.
Probabilities of above normal precipitation exceed 50 percent across parts of
western Mainland Alaska. Below normal precipitation is favored for much of the
Great Basin and High Plains due to the subtropical ridging and associated
slightly above normal heights forecast across these regions. Farther to the
east, above normal precipitation is favored across much of the eastern CONUS,
near the deamplifying trough forecast over eastern North America.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 40% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on
Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Much below normal, 1 out of 5,
due
to relatively large changes among the model guidance relative to yesterdays
solutions as well as weak 500-hPa height anomalies predicted across the CONUS.

FORECASTER: Scott H

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
August 19.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0234 PM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021

Valid 281200Z - 291200Z

Small adjustments were made to the isolated dry thunderstorm
delineation across the Northwest, and the Elevated area in the
northern High Plains, to account for the latest guidance consensus.
Otherwise, the previous forecast remains on track. Please see the
previous forecast below for more details.

..Squitieri.. 07/27/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0157 AM CDT Tue Jul 27 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level ridge will amplify on Tuesday night and be centered
near western Nebraska during the day Wednesday. At the surface, a
weak low pressure is forecast to cross the Dakotas. In its wake, dry
and breezy conditions are forecast in its wake.

...IsoDryT - Pacific Northwest...
Isolated dry thunderstorms will be possible again on Wednesday
across much of northern California and the Northwest. Cloud cover
which limited instability on Monday and Tuesday is not expected to
be an inhibiting factor on Wednesday. Therefore, despite warming
temperatures aloft due to the building upper-level ridge, ample
instability is forecast for isolated to scattered storm development
from northern California into Idaho and western Montana. Slightly
greater coverage may be possible in south-central Oregon as a weak
shortwave is forecast to move northward during the afternoon hours
and may provide enough additional ascent for more storms.

...Southeast Montana, northwest North Dakota, and northeast
Wyoming...
Dry and breezy conditions are forecast in the wake of a surface cold
front on Wednesday afternoon across portions of the northern Plains.
At this time the elevated area is focused in the immediate wake of
the cold front where there is the best chance for dry and breezy
conditions, but the GFS has a much larger area of potential elevated
conditions which extends across much of North Dakota. Since
high-resolution guidance keeps the threat confined to areas
immediately behind the front, have not expanded the elevated to
these areas, but will continue to monitor this in later forecasts.

...Excessive Heat Warning over parts of the Northern High Plains;
Heat Advisory over parts of the Lower Mississippi Valley/Southern
Plains, Northern/Central Plains, and the Northern High Plains...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Upper Midwest/Upper Great Lakes Wednesday through early Thursday
and for the Southeast through Wednesday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Midwest and the Lower Great Lakes through Wednesday
morning...

Hot conditions will persist across portions of the Northern High
Plains, Central and Southeast U.S. - this vast area has Heat
Advisories in place from central Montana to central Georgia with
pockets of Excessive Heat Warnings over northeast Oklahoma,
eastern Montana and north-central Wyoming, as well as, Excessive
Heat Watches over parts of Minnesota and Iowa.
Daily temperatures will rise into the upper 90s to low 100s.
Several regions have Air Quality Alerts due to Canadian wildfires
and the wildfires over the Northwest into the Northern Rockies.
The hot and dry airmass over the West has weakened the impact of
the Southwest Monsoon but there will be an uptick expected in the
risk for excessive rainfall by Friday. Showers and thunderstorms
will continue over the Southwest, Central/Southern Rockies, and
Great Basin through Thursday, becoming more diurnal. Marginal Risk
areas are in effect through Thursday and a Slight Risk is in
effect for parts of Arizona on Friday.

A front extending from the Northeast, across the Great Lakes and
into the Northern High Plains will have multiple waves of low
pressure traverse through this boundary as it sags southward. This
boundary will provide focus for showers and thunderstorms to
develop near it and some may become severe. SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Upper
Midwest and the Lower Great Lakes through Wednesday morning;
frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, hail, and minimal risk of
tornadoes are possible. This threat will translate to the Upper
Great Lakes/Upper Mississippi Valley on Thursday. Heavy rainfall
and flash flooding will also accompany these severe storms. WPC
has a Slight Risk for excessive rainfall in effect.

Another front extending from the Mid-Atlantic region across the
Ohio/Tennessee Valleys into the Northern Plains will begin to
weaken. Tropical moisture will pool over the Southeast, Lower
Mississippi Valley and the Southern Plains and will aid in the
development of showers and thunderstorms as pulses of energy pass
through in the mid/upper atmosphere. Periods of heavy rain are
expected and may lead to an increase risk for flash flooding.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern spreads over
the West...

18Z Update:  Overall, the models and ensemble means are in above
average agreement on the synoptic scale features through at least
Sunday, with an eastern U.S. trough and a central/western U.S.
ridge resulting in a fairly amplified pattern.  For the
fronts/pressures, the CMC becomes a strong outlier with an upper
trough/low over the eastern Pacific, and the 00/06Z runs of the
GFS became more progressive with shortwave energy across the Great
Lakes and Northeast by the weekend when compared to the ensemble
guidance.  For the Friday through Sunday time period, a general
blend of the UKMET/GFS/ECMWF/some CMC was used as a forecast
baseline, and then maintaining some of the GFS/ECMWF along with
their ensemble means for next Monday and Tuesday, while keeping
some previous WPC continuity.  The previous discussion is appended
below for reference. /Hamrick

...Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Latest guidance remains consistent and agrees that a strong closed
upper high over the central U.S. will gradually weaken and shift
southward from late this week into next as a ridge extends through
the Rockies and north-central Intermountain West to western
Canada. The northward amplitude and sharpness of the ridge will
likely support an unseasonably deep eastern Canada/U.S. upper
trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting across the West between the
ridge/closed high and emerging eastern Pacific troughing will
promote widespread chances for monsoonal rainfall with isolated
local runoff issues. Highest rainfall totals during the five-day
period are likely to be over the Great Basin and northern-central
Rockies where there should also be increasing coverage of daytime
highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand the Pacific Northwest
may see very warm to hot conditions (highs up to 10-15F above
normal), especially Friday-Saturday, before a moderating trend as
heights aloft decline. Some record warm minimum temperature
records will be possible to the west of the Rockies, both within
the warm pattern over the Northwest and elsewhere due to
clouds/moisture. Areas from the southern Plains into Lower
Mississippi Valley will be rather hot, albeit with mostly
single-digit anomalies for daytime highs. Many record warm lows
are also likely across the moist South.

Meanwhile, multiple shortwaves rounding the aforementioned upper
ridge will dig downstream to amplify the mean upper trough over
the northeastern quadrant of the lower 48. Favorable upper support
may help to produce strong convection and locally heavy downpours
focusing with moisture/instability pooling near wavy fronts that
may become slow moving as they reach the southern periphery of the
mean trough aloft. Convective outflow and reinforcing frontal
surges will act to gradually shift best focused rainfall chances
later this week into next down over the Plains and from the
Mid-MS/TN Valleys to the Carolinas/Southeast, with guidance trends
forcing the main axis of precipitation slightly southward compared
to continuity. The eastern U.S. pattern will be most favorable for
below normal temperatures from the Great Lakes/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where a few locations with shorter periods of record
may approach record low values on Saturday morning.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability Days
3-7. A trend to develop an unseasonably amplified eastern U.S.
upper trough seems reasonable considering the strength of the
upstream ridge. The WPC medium range product suite was derived
from a blend of well clustered guidance of the 18 UTC GFS and 12
UTC ECMWF/UKMET/Canadian along with the 01 UTC National Blend of
Models Friday into the weekend before switching to a blend of the
ECENS/GEFS ensemble means and 18 UTC GFS/12 UTC ECMWF by early
next week. This strategy maintained excellent WPC product
continuity.

The latest 00 UTC GFS/ECMWF maintain good run to run continuity
despite continued differences with shortwaves in the large scale
eastern U.S. upper trough. The blend mitigates these differences.
The 12 UTC UKMET/Canadian were outliers into Sunday-Tuesday by
bringing northeast Pacific upper trough energy more robustly
inland into western Canada than the GFS/ECMWF and GEFS/ECMWF
ensemble means. The 00 UTC UKMET/Canadian have trended in line
with other guidance, bolstering forecast confidence.

continues to advect northward around the westward edge of this
ridge. At the surface, a weak area of low pressure will move through
the Dakotas with a trailing cold front extending back into eastern
Montana and eastern Wyoming.

...IsoDryT - Northwest and northern Rockies...
Cloud cover which has limited instability the past few days will
move northward into Canada leaving mostly clear skies across the
Northwest. This should allow significant heating and instability to
develop by the afternoon. Other than a weak shortwave forecast to
move through western Oregon, forcing is forecast to be nebulous.
However, at least isolated storm development is expected, especially
over the higher terrain in central Idaho and western Montana. PWAT
values are on the higher side in the region (0.8 to 1.0 inches), but
fuels remain extremely dry with ERC values above the 95th
percentile.

...Portions of the northern Plains...
A cold front is forecast to move southward across the northern
Plains this afternoon. In its wake, dry and breezy conditions are
forecast with winds of 15 to 20 mph and RH values around 20 to 30
percent. Fuels are very dry in this region with near-record ERC
values in many spots. Therefore, elevated fire weather conditions
are expected.

Valid 291200Z - 301200Z

...Synopsis...
An upper-level ridge centered across the Plains will remain in place
on Thursday. Heights are forecast to rise across the Northwest on
Friday, but there should be enough heating and instability for at
least isolated thunderstorm activity from northern California to
central Idaho. PWAT values should be similar to Wednesday (around
0.8 to 1 inches) across the region. However, with only isolated
storm coverage expected on Wednesday, there should be little if any
change to fuel dryness, and thus fuels should remain susceptible to
ignitions from any lightning on Thursday.

...Widespread Monsoonal Moisture and Rainfall Pattern over the
West...
...Heavy Convection/Rainfall Threat for the
South/Southeast/Southern Mid-Atlantic...

...Pattern Overview with Weather Highlights/Hazards...

A closed upper high slid over the south-central U.S. will
gradually weaken this weekend as ridging builds over the Rockies,
Intermountain West and western Canada into next week. Ridge
amplitude will support an unseasonably deep and persistent eastern
Canada/U.S. upper trough.

Impulses and moisture lifting around the ridge and on the eastern
periphery of eastern Pacific upper troughing will present
widespread monsoonal rainfall with local runoff issues. Best
chances are from the Southwest/CA to the central Great
Basin/Rockies where there will also be increasing coverage of
daytime highs 5-15F below normal. On the other hand, the Pacific
Northwest may see up to 10-15F above normal highs Saturday, before
a gradual moderating trend as heights aloft decline. Record warm
minimum temperature records will be possible west of the Rockies
over the Northwest Saturday and elsewhere with monsoonal
clouds/moisture.

Meanwhile, shortwaves rounding the upper ridge will periodically
dig downstream to reinforce an eastern U.S. upper trough.
Favorable support aloft may help to produce strong convection and
locally heavy downpours as moisture/instability pool near wavy
fronts slowing on the southern trough periphery. Rainfall chances
shift through the south-central Plains, mid/lower MS and TN
Valleys and southern Mid-Atlantic/Southeast. The pattern favors
below normal temperatures from the Midwest/Northeast to the
Mid-Atlantic where spotty/modest record lows are possible. The
Deep South will be steamy with record warm lows possible along and
south of a main and wavy front.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The medium range pattern offers above average predictability. The
WPC medium range product suite was derived from best clustered
guidance of the 18 UTC GFS/GEFS and 12 UTC ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble
mean along with the 01 UTC National Blend of Models. Transitioned
WPC blend weights increasingly from the models to the ensemble
means over time consistent with gradually growing forecast spread.
This maintains good WPC product continuity that seems in line with
newer 00 UTC guidance.

...There is a Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Upper Mississippi Valley, Upper Great Lakes, and parts of the
Ohio Valley through Thursday morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes through Thursday
morning...

...There is a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall over parts of the
Southwest Thursday into Friday morning...

...Heat Advisory over parts of the Mississippi Valley and the
Plains; Excessive Heat Warning over parts of the Northwest...

A front extending from the northern Mid-Atlantic across the Ohio
Valley into the Upper Midwest will have a wave of low pressure
traveling along the boundary through Thursday. As a result,
showers and thunderstorms will develop along and near the boundary
through Thursday evening. Some of these thunderstorms will become
severe with more robust dynamics.  Therefore, the SPC has issued a
Moderate Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of Upper Great
Lakes through Thursday morning.  The hazards associated with these
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gusts, hail, and a few tornadoes. There is a 10% or greater
probability of wind gust of 65 knots or greater and a 10% or
greater probability of two-inch or great hail over parts of the
Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great Lakes through Thursday
morning.  Furthermore, there is a 10% or greater probability of
EF2-EF5 over parts of the Upper Mississippi Valley/Upper Great
Lakes through Thursday morning.

Additionally, the thunderstorms will produce heavy rain.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
with these thunderstorms over parts of the Upper Mississippi
Valley, Upper Great Lakes, and parts of the Ohio Valley through
Thursday morning.  The associated heavy rain will create mainly
localized areas of flash flooding, with urban areas, roads, and
small streams the most vulnerable.

Showers and thunderstorms will continue along and near the
boundary through Friday. The severe thunderstorm threat shifts to
the Ohio Valley, Mid-Atlantic, Central Appalachians, and Northeast
Thursday into Friday morning.  The excessive rainfall threat
decreases slightly on Thursday into Friday morning.

Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms will continue over the
Southwest, Central/Southern Rockies, and Great Basin today, though
the excessive rainfall threat will be lower. However, the
monsoonal moisture streams back into the Southwest as strong
upper-level energy passes over the region Thursday into Friday.
Therefore, the WPC has issued a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
over the Southwest on Thursday into Friday morning. The associated
heavy rain will create mainly localized areas of flash flooding,
with urban areas, roads, and small streams the most vulnerable.

Over the Northwest, there is an Excessive Heat Warning over parts
of the area, where temperatures will be above average.
Furthermore, Heat Advisories are currently in effect for portions
of the Mississippi Valley and the Plains where the temperatures
will be 10 to 20 degrees above average.  Moreover, several regions
have Air Quality Alerts due to wildfires over the Northwest into
the Northern Rockies.

Valid 081700Z - 091200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO
CENTRAL WYOMING...

A few expansions were made to the Elevated delineation (mainly in
New Mexico) to account for the latest guidance consensus. The latest
high-resolution model runs also suggest locally Critical conditions
may occur this afternoon along the lee of the northern Sierra,
though the brevity of the more favorable surface wind/RH overlap
precludes Critical highlights in this area. Otherwise, the previous
forecast remains on track for Elevated/Critical conditions occurring
across the Great Basin into Wyoming this afternoon, with current
METAR observations showing Critical conditions already underway at
some locales. Please see the previous forecast below for more
details.

..Squitieri.. 06/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CDT Tue Jun 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
A compact mid-level shortwave trough is apparent over southern
California early this morning. This shortwave trough will shift
northeastward through the day today. As it does, lee troughing is
anticipated with a lee cyclone in the vicinity of eastern
Wyoming/eastern Montana and the northern Great Basin. Strong
mid-level flow is anticipated in close proximity to this upper-level
shortwave trough. Deep mixing is forecast across much of the Great
Basin and therefore, some of this stronger mid-level flow is
expected to make it to the surface. The stronger winds are forecast
where the stronger mid-level flow is expected to pass overhead from
southern Nevada into central Wyoming, where a critical delineation
is present.

Elevated fire weather conditions are forecast across portions of New
Mexico. A lack of upper-level support should limit the overall wind
speeds, but the tightening pressure gradient in response to the lee
cyclogenesis should be sufficient for some gusty winds.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat Friday across central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...

...Much above normal temperatures and record heat this weekend
into early next week across much of the interior West/Northern
Plains....

...Overview...

Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing will exit but then build back into the East
where rainfall will focus over the Mid-Atlantic into the
Southeast. A Pacific front will push into WA/OR early next week.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday) and will be driven by a strong upper ridge or
closed high over New Mexico (500mb height anomalies at least +2 to
+3 sigma). Weaker ridging across the southern to central U.S. will
erode as troughing becoming established over the Northeast this
weekend an reinforced early next week. 00Z ECMWF and its ensembles
were more bullish in troughing over the Great Lakes than the
GFS/GEFS and CMC/CMC ensembles, but such a strong upstream ridge
could support this deeper troughing in the ECMWF guidance. For
now, opted to split the difference via a multi-model/ensemble mean
blend (GFS/GEFS and ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean) as the lead-in
evolution across the Upper Midwest will be sensitive to how some
smaller-scale features track.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to possibly
record warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern
Plains late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible
across central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime lows
will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to 15F
above normal for middle of June. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
temperature anomalies are expected to be near to slightly above
normal.

The threat of locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash
flooding will linger on Friday across portions of the central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic as higher moisture interacts with a
southward-dropping cold front. For the weekend and early next
week, the dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep
much of the area on the drier side with any substantial
precipitation confined to the Pacific Northwest as well as
portions of the Southeast and Florida along a residual frontal
boundary.

blend (GFS/GEFS and ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean) as the lead-in
evolution across the Upper Midwest will be sensitive to how some
smaller-scale features track.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to possibly
record warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern
Plains late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible
across central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime lows
will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to 15F
above normal for middle of June. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
temperature anomalies are expected to be near to slightly above
normal.

The threat of locally heavy rainfall capable of producing flash
flooding will linger on Friday across portions of the central
Appalachians and Mid-Atlantic as higher moisture interacts with a
southward-dropping cold front. For the weekend and early next
week, the dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep
much of the area on the drier side with any substantial
precipitation confined to the Pacific Northwest as well as
portions of the Southeast and Florida along a residual frontal
boundary.

...Locally heavy rainfall threat Friday across central
Appalachians/Mid-Atlantic...

...Much above normal temperatures and record heat this weekend
into early next week across much of the interior West/Northern
Plains....

...Overview...

Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing will exit but then build back into the East
where rainfall will focus over the Mid-Atlantic into the
Southeast. A Pacific front will push into WA/OR early next week.


...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

The latest model guidance offers average to above average
predictability for the Nation during the medium range period
(Friday-Tuesday) and will be driven by a strong upper ridge or
closed high over New Mexico (500mb height anomalies at least +2 to
+3 sigma). Weaker ridging across the southern to central U.S. will
erode as troughing becoming established over the Northeast this
weekend an reinforced early next week. 00Z ECMWF and its ensembles
were more bullish in troughing over the Great Lakes than the
GFS/GEFS and CMC/CMC ensembles, but such a strong upstream ridge
could support this deeper troughing in the ECMWF guidance. For
now, opted to split the difference via a multi-model/ensemble mean
blend (GFS/GEFS and ECMWF/ECMWF ensemble mean) as the lead-in
evolution across the Upper Midwest will be sensitive to how some

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT June 08 2021

SYNOPSIS: Amplified mid-level high pressure is predicted to dominate the
western third of the lower 48 throughout week-2, supporting anomalously war=
m
temperatures and possible excessive heat across the western half of the
country, extending into parts of the Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley.
There
continues to be relatively good model agreement indicating increased chance=
s
for tropical cyclone formation over the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico during
mid-June which may bring heavy rainfall and high winds to parts of the
southeastern quadrant, including Texas. Mid-level low pressure is forecast =
to
form across the North-Central and North-Eastern Pacific, favoring above nor=
mal
precipitation for parts of Mainland Alaska and the Aleutians. Precipitation
amounts are not anticipated to exceed pre-defined hazards thresholds.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of excessive heat across parts of the Rockies, Great Basin,
Southwest, and Northern Plains, Wed-Thu, Jun 16-17.

Slight risk of excessive heat across many parts of the western half of the
CONUS, Wed-Sat, Jun 16-19.

Slight risk of excessive heat across parts of interior California, the Grea=
t
Basin, Rockies, Northern Plains, and Southwest, Fri-Mon, Jun 18-21.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Lower Mississippi Valle=
y,
Tennessee Valley, Southern Appalachians, Southeast, and Texas, Thu-Sun, Jun
17-20.

Slight risk of high winds across portions of the Gulf Coast states, Thu-Sun=
,
Jun 17-20.

Slight risk of high winds across coastal portions of northern and central
California, Wed-Sun, Jun 16-20.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR FRIDAY JUNE 11 - TUESDAY JUNE 15:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.p=
hp__;!!DZ3fjg!rVUj08hACOLHusdcgk1HpbmPJX9GLnLNPeWah5TlJDUQinkbKWIltI1SsIb4b=
J18trYso2e0$

FOR WEDNESDAY JUNE 16 - TUESDAY JUNE 22: Anomalous amplified mid-level ridg=
ing
is predicted to dominate the western two-thirds of the CONUS throughout
week-2.
Despite the 0Z GEFS, ECMWF, and Canadian ensemble means generally indicatin=
g
weakening of this ridge throughout the period (especially across the
Northwest), many areas across the western two-thirds continue to have
increased
chances for excessive heat. Today's GEFS reforecast tool has better agreeme=
nt
with the ECMWF reforecast tool for the beginning to middle of week-2,
regarding
the extension of possible excessive heat further eastward to the North-Cent=
ral
CONUS. A slight risk of excessive heat is posted for many parts of the west=
ern
half of the CONUS, June 16 to 19. The ECMWF reforecast tool continues to sh=
ow
at least a 20% chance of maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile
persisting throughout parts of the North-Central CONUS throughout the entir=
e
period, although the GEFS limits the excessive heat to the Rockies and
westward
toward the end of week-2. Therefore, a slight risk of excessive heat is
identified for the Rockies and westward, June 18 to 21, where the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools have agreement. A moderate risk of excessive heat is
designated for parts of the Rockies, Great Basin, Southwest, and Northern
Plains, June 16 to 17, where both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools indic=
ate
at least a 40% (20%) chance of exceeding the 85th (95th) percentile. In
general
both reforecast tools show maximum temperatures potentially exceeding 90 (1=
00)
deg F across the Northwest and Northern Plains (Southwest, San Joaquin Vall=
ey
and Southern California). Many parts of the West, especially southwestern
CONUS
continue to experience severe drought. Anticipated dry conditions and
anomalous
heat across the West may support increased chances for localized wildfire r=
isk
during the period. The National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC) fire potenti=
al
outlook shows moderate risk for significant potential across much of the
southwestern quadrant of the country, with high risk triggers (lightning an=
d
low humidity) for June 14, where anomalous hot, dry conditions are anticipa=
ted
for week-2.



Across the tropics, the large-scale environment continues to remain favorab=
le
for tropical cyclogenesis in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico during
week-2. Dynamical models continue to support tropical cyclone (TC) formatio=
n,
although there is significant model uncertainty regarding the details of th=
e
timing and evolution of TCs. The ECMWF probabilistic TC tool depicts elevat=
ed
chances for cyclone development initially over the Bay of Campeche at the
beginning of the period, with increased potential extending into the Gulf o=
f
Mexico throughout the period. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) currently

Mid-level troughing is forecast to form over the North-Central and

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Tue June 08 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 14 - 18 2021

Today's model solutions are in a good agreement on the 500-hPa circulation
pattern across the forecast domain. An amplified pattern is predicted,
consisting of an anomalous trough over the eastern Aleutians southeastward =
to
the West Coast, a strongly amplified ridge centered over much of the wester=
n
and central CONUS, and an amplified trough over the eastern CONUS.

Troughing centered across the Aleutians and associated southerly flow are
forecast to favor relatively warm conditions for Alaska. Downstream,
anomalously strong ridging predicted over much of the west-central CONUS is
expected to significantly increase chances of above normal temperatures acr=
oss
most of the western and central CONUS, especially over parts of the Norther=
n
and Central Rockies as well as the Northern Plains, where positive height
anomalies are forecast to be the highest. The potential for some shortwave
troughs and frontal activities persist over parts of the Southern Plains an=
d
much of the eastern CONUS, enhancing the likelihood of near to below normal
temperatures over those regions. Above normal temperatures are favored over
the
central and southern Florida Peninsula, consistent with the consolidation
forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered across the Aleutians favors near to above norma=
l
precipitation over western and northern Alaska. Downstream, a forecast trou=
gh
over the Eastern Pacific favors above normal precipitation over parts of th=
e
Pacific Northwest. Anomalously strong ridging and positive height anomalies
predicted over much of the western and central CONUS are expected to
significantly increase chances of below normal precipitation across much of
the
northern and central CONUS, especially over parts of the Northern Rockies a=

Upper Mississippi Valley. The potential for some shortwave troughs predicte=

across parts of the Southern Plains and Southeast and moisture flow from so=

enhance chances of near to above normal precipitation over the coastal regi=

of the Gulf of Mexico and the southern Four Corners areas.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 15% of Today's 6z GF=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Well above average, 4 out of 5=
,
due to good agreement among the model solutions, an amplified pattern
predicted
across the domain, offset by some uncertainties among the precipitation and
temperature forecast tools.

8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUN 16 - 22 2021

During the week-2 period, the 500-hPa circulation pattern is forecast to
persist, but deamplify relative to the 6-10 day period. Because the week-2
mid-level pattern is expected to be similar to the 6-10 day period, the
temperature and precipitation probability forecasts are quite similar betwe=
en
the two outlook periods.

Above normal temperatures are expected for northern and western Mainland
Alaska
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool. Positive height anomalies
associated with the forecast ridge centered over the west-central CONUS fav=
or
above normal temperatures across the western and central CONUS. Near to bel=
ow
temperatures are expected over parts of the Southern Plains and most of the
eastern CONUS underneath forecast below normal 500-hPa heights. Above norma=
l
temperatures are more likely for the central and southern Florida Peninsula
consistent with the consolidation forecast tool.

Forecast troughing centered over the Aleutians favors above normal
precipitation over much of Alaska. Below normal precipitation is likely acr=
oss
much of the northern and central CONUS and parts of the Southern Plains
underneath forecast ridging over the western CONUS and predicted surface hi=
gh
pressure over the eastern CONUS. Due in part to the potential for increased
tropical activity over parts of the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, above nor=
mal
precipitation is favored for states along the Gulf of Mexico and parts of t=
he
Southeast.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 15% of Today's 6z G=

Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 15% of Today's GFS Superensemble Mean
centered on Day 11, 10% of Today's operational 6z GFS centered on Day 11, 4=

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=

good agreement among model circulation forecasts, offset by increasing
uncertainty and differences among the temperature and precipitation forecas=

tools.

FORECASTER: Y. Fan

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues=
.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issu=
ed.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same=
 as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange=
,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on th=
e
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (gree=
n,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median valu=
es
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a norma=
l
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the clima=
te
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
June 17.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE GREAT BASIN...

The elevated delineation was expanded further into Wyoming, with
small adjustments made to the ongoing fire weather highlights
elsewhere to account for the latest guidance. In addition, locally
Critical conditions are also possible across portions of southern
into eastern Utah by afternoon peak heating. Locally Elevated
conditions are also possible along the lee of the Cascades given the
presence of downslope flow. Please see the previous forecast below
for details regarding the current Elevated/Critical fire weather
highlights.

..Squitieri.. 06/08/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 1228 AM CDT Tue Jun 08 2021/

...Synopsis...
On Wednesday, a large upper-level trough will slowly shift east
toward the Great Basin. This approaching trough will lead to some
lee cyclogenesis in the northern Great Basin. In addition, strong
downslope flow and deep mixing is anticipated as 50+ mph mid-level
flow crosses the Sierra. Therefore, strong surface winds of 30 to 35
mph are possible in portions of eastern Nevada and western Utah. In
addition, a dry surface airmass will be in place with relative
humidity around 10 to 15 percent. ERC values are now above the 90th
percentile in much of the Great Basin and thus fuels are likely
critically dry across the region.

Wednesday morning...

...Persistent heat for much of the Great Plains along with threats
for severe thunderstorms across the northern High Plains into
central Montana...

...Increased chances for flash flooding from the Lower Mississippi
Valley into the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys through Thursday...

An active weather pattern will continue across the lower 48
through the middle of the week with threats for severe storms and
flash flooding in a few locations. First, additional heavy rain is
expected to impact portions of southern Arkansas and northern
Louisiana into northern Mississippi where three to six inches of
rain has fallen over the past 48 hours, with potential for an
additional three to six inches through early Wednesday morning.
Flash flood watches and warnings are already in effect for this
portion of the country, so additional heavy rainfall on top of
areas already impacted by flooding will only make conditions worse.

Farther to the north, severe thunderstorms are expected to develop
through this evening from central/eastern Montana into the western
Dakotas and western Nebraska in the vicinity of a slow moving
front draped roughly west to east across the northern U.S.
Temperatures across the north-central U.S. will remain hot, with
high temperatures forecast to remain about 15 to 25 degrees above
average. Hot weather will also be in place across the South where
high temperatures should reach into the low to mid-100s on
Wednesday and Thursday across eastern New Mexico and West Texas.
Little relief in the form of rain is expected.

A slow moving upper level disturbance will keep locations
unsettled for most of the eastern half of the nation. Daily
chances for thunderstorms combined with above average moisture in
place on top of near-saturated soils will keep flash flooding a
concern from the Lower Mississippi Valley into the Tennessee and
Ohio Valleys, as well as portions of the East Coast into the day
on Thursday.

...Much above normal temperatures and record heat this weekend
into early next week across much of the interior West/Northern
Plains....

...Overview...
Upper pattern is forecast to amplify along 105W this weekend into
early next week, promoting warm/hot temperatures over much of the
West and northern High Plains that may near or break daily
records. Troughing will exit but then build back into the East
where rainfall will focus over the Mid-Atlantic into the
Southeast. A Pacific front will push into the Pacific Northwest
early next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...
The latest model guidance for the medium range period
(Saturday-Wednesday) is in reasonable agreement and offers average
to above average predictability and consistency. The upper flow
amplification driven by near +3 sigma height anomalies is well
agreed by the most recent deterministic and ensemble guidance. The
largest model spread exists with downstream troughing potential
for the Great Lakes to Northeast. With such strong ridging, the
deeper troughing has become a clearer signal and preferred pattern
but the depth and progressiveness remains uncertain. Upstream
energy and interactions with shortwave energy coming out of Hudson
Bay lower confidence by the middle of next week. With this in
mind, the WPC blend utilized the ECMWF/CMC/GFS followed by a ECENS
led blend by days 6-7.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...
The amplification of the upper ridge over the central U.S. is
expected to bring another round of much above normal to possibly
record warm/hot temperatures to the northern Rockies and northern
Plains late this weekend and early next week. Temperatures may be
10-25F above normal with some triple-digit readings possible
across central/eastern Montana Monday and Tuesday. Nighttime lows
will also remain warm for the region and likely stay 10F to 15F
above normal for middle of June. Elsewhere across the CONUS,
temperatures are expected to be near to slightly above normal. The
strong/dominant upper ridge over the central CONUS will keep much
of the area void of significant or heavy rainfall, the exception
being possibly along the Gulf Coast to Southeast U.S. late this
weekend into early next week where a frontal boundary stalls and
lingers.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR MUCH OF EASTERN NEVADA...FAR
NORTHWEST ARIZONA...AND WESTERN UTAH...

...Synopsis...
A broad upper trough will shift slowly east through the day, leading
to moderate mid-level flow and lee cyclogenesis in the Great Basin.
Very dry surface conditions are forecast this afternoon across much
of the Southwest, Great Basin, and central Rockies. Surface winds
will increase through the day as a result of deep thermal mixing
transporting stronger flow to the surface, and also as a result of
the tightening pressure gradient accompanying lee cyclogenesis.

By mid to late afternoon, expect relative humidity of 6 to 12
percent and a broad region of 20 to 30 mph winds. Within this larger
region, some sustained surface winds in excess of 30 mph are
expected, especially across portions of Nevada. While meteorological
conditions will likely support an extremely critical delineation,
fuels across Nevada are mostly characterized by ERCs in the 85 to
90th percentile, which could be a limiting factor to extreme fire
behavior.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook

0151 AM CDT Wed Jun 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN ARIZONA NORTHEASTWARD
INTO CENTRAL WYOMING....

...Synopsis...
On Thursday, a mid-level shortwave trough is forecast to shift from
southern Nevada into western Wyoming during the day. On the southern
periphery of this trough, 40 to 50 knots of mid-level flow is
forecast. In addition, very strong lee cyclogenesis is forecast in
eastern Montana during the afternoon, which will tighten the
pressure gradient across much of the northern and central Rockies.

These combined effects of deep mixing amid strong mid-level flow and
a strong surface pressure gradient will lead to strong surface winds
ahead of the surface cold front, from southeast Utah into northwest
Colorado and central Wyoming. Sustained winds of 30 to 35 mph are
likely in this region with relative humidity around 7 to 10 percent.

In addition, fuels in this region are quite dry with ERCs well above
the 90th percentile in most areas; some ERCs approach the 97th
percentile. Extreme fire behavior on multiple fires the last few
days with lighter winds builds more support for the idea that fuels
are very dry. In addition, there are at least half a dozen ongoing
fires in the region where the worst conditions are forecast on
Thursday. An extremely critical delineation was strongly considered
this outlook, but would like to see 12Z high-resolution guidance
confirm the extremely critical conditions before adding it.

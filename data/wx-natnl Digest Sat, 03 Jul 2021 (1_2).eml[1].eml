Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1136 AM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021

Valid 021700Z - 031200Z

Trimmed the western portion of the isolated dry thunderstorm area
out of much of Oregon. Forecast soundings for this afternoon/evening
show most of the instability from far southeast Oregon eastward.
This was further validated by 12Z HREF guidance which shows very
little convection within the state of Oregon.

Otherwise, no changes were made.

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
The strong mid-level anticyclone that has been centered over
southwest Canada for the past week will undergo weakening on Friday,
with mid-level flow becoming more westerly across the Pacific
Northwest. A weak mid-level trough will move through this westerly
flow and into the the northern High Plains, and in its wake a broad
mid-level ridge will begin to build northward from the Southwest.

... Interior Pacific Northwest ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms are possible across much of the
interior portions of the western United States on Friday as strong
diurnal heating combines with a relatively moist airmass
(precipitable water values approaching 1 inch in places). Given the
relatively moist airmass, thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than
dry, with the most likely area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be
across portions of northern California northeast into far southwest
Montana. Here, the combination of slightly lower precipitable water
values, faster mid-level flow, and a drier sub-cloud layer will
yield at least isolated dry thunderstorm potential. Elsewhere, dry,
receptive fuels will pose at least some risk for lightning-induced
fire starts, especially with lightning strikes occurring outside
precipitation cores.

... Eastern Montana ...

Ahead of the aforementioned weak mid-level trough, gusty
southeasterly flow will persist through the morning on Friday,
before the surface-pressure gradient begins to weaken later in the
day as the mid-level trough passes. The result will be the potential
for a couple of hours of elevated fire weather conditions as surface
winds in the 10-20 mph range may overlap relative humidity around 20
percent.

Valid 12Z Mon Jul 05 2021 - 12Z Fri Jul 09 2021

...Elsa may impact Florida and the Southeast Atlantic Coast early
to mid-next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
as low pressure lingers through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. A strengthening upper ridge is forecast over the Desert
Southwest and Four Corners states, while a weak upper trough/low
slowly sinks south in and around Texas, and a fairly low amplitude
trough will be centered around the Great Lakes region.
Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa has the potential
to cross Florida and move up the Southeast Coast early to midweek,
with its track possibly influenced by the Great Lakes trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the midlatitude pattern
described above (with the main exception of the
track/timing/strength of Elsa). A mainly deterministic model blend
of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z UKMET and ECMWF sufficed for early in
the period. By the latter part of the week, models generally show
a shortwave moving across southwestern Canada, but with some
differences in the details. The 00Z CMC was the largest outlier of
the deterministic guidance with this feature, so it was not used,
and minor timing and strength differences in the other
deterministic guidance were able to be taken care of by
incorporating some of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

Regarding Elsa, a large amount of model spread remains, though
some guidance may be starting to converge on a track into the
eastern Gulf of Mexico like the current forecast from the National
Hurricane Center shows. The GFS runs for multiple days have been
steady with a track similar to that, though with some timing
differences. And many members of the 00Z EC ensemble now show low
centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Periods of rain are forecast along and
ahead of a front moving from the north-central to northeastern
CONUS through the week. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the
week with cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level
disturbance there.

...Elsa may impact Florida and the Southeast Atlantic Coast early
to mid-next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
as low pressure lingers through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. A strengthening upper ridge is forecast over the Desert
Southwest and Four Corners states, while a weak upper trough/low
slowly sinks south in and around Texas, and a fairly low amplitude
trough will be centered around the Great Lakes region.
Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa has the potential
to cross Florida and move up the Southeast Coast early to midweek,
with its track possibly influenced by the Great Lakes trough.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the midlatitude pattern
described above (with the main exception of the
track/timing/strength of Elsa). A mainly deterministic model blend
of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z UKMET and ECMWF sufficed for early in
the period. By the latter part of the week, models generally show
a shortwave moving across southwestern Canada, but with some
differences in the details. The 00Z CMC was the largest outlier of
the deterministic guidance with this feature, so it was not used,
and minor timing and strength differences in the other
deterministic guidance were able to be taken care of by
incorporating some of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

Regarding Elsa, a large amount of model spread remains, though
some guidance may be starting to converge on a track into the
eastern Gulf of Mexico like the current forecast from the National
Hurricane Center shows. The GFS runs for multiple days have been
steady with a track similar to that, though with some timing
differences. And many members of the 00Z EC ensemble now show low
centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Periods of rain are forecast along and
ahead of a front moving from the north-central to northeastern
CONUS through the week. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Fri July 02 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 08 - 12 2021

The GFS and ECMWF ensemble means remain in excellent agreement and depict a
high amplitude longwave pattern for July with a 500-hPa trough (ridge) over
Alaska (the western CONUS). The 0Z Canadian ensemble mean continues to be much
less amplified and is considered to be an outlier among model solutions.
500-hPa heights are forecast to average more than +60 meters above normal,
which are large for this time of year, and strongly support above normal
temperatures throughout the West and Northern High Plains. Due to the more
amplified ridge axis becoming centered farther to the west, a 500-hPa trough
with slightly below normal heights is forecast over the east-central CONUS.
Therefore, near to below normal temperatures are favored for this region and
with favored below normal temperatures extending southward to the Southern
Great Plains. A two-category change from above to below normal temperatures
was
necessary for parts of the Midwest and Northeast, given the more amplified
trough predicted and recent model guidance.

Early on July 2, Hurricane Elsa tracked across Barbados and the National
Hurricane Center forecasts Elsa to continue on the northwest track towards
Hispaniola and Cuba this weekend. Very large model spread continues regarding
Elsas strength and track by early next week, with outcomes ranging from the
Gulf of Mexico to the Bahamas. Probabilities of above normal precipitation
remain elevated across the eastern Carolinas and Mid-Atlantic, given the good
continuity from the GFS model with Elsa potentially affecting these areas on
days 6 and 7. Also, if Elsa eventually tracks north along the East Coast it
could interact with a front and result in heavy to excessive rainfall later
next week. Please refer to the National Hurricane Center for the latest
updates
and forecasts on Hurricane Elsa.

A positively-tilted trough aloft and the potential for two frontal passages
are
likely to enhance rainfall across the eastern third of the CONUS where above
normal precipitation is favored. The elevated probabilities of above normal
precipitation extend southwest to the southern Great Plains and Rio Grande
Valley, based on good agreement and continuity among the precipitation tools.
In the wake of the current predicted track of Elsa, a drying trend is expected
across Florida. The amplified 500-hPa ridge aloft favors below normal
precipitation across much of the West along with the Northern and Central
Great
Plains. As a 500-hPa ridge becomes centered over the Four Corners region
during
early to mid-July, an increase in monsoonal flow is likely to overspread
Arizona and New Mexico. Therefore, the coverage with a favored area of near to
above normal precipitation is expanded compared to previous days.

Forecast confidence in the temperature outlook remains high across Alaska as
an
amplified 500-hPa trough favors below normal temperatures. Along and east of
this trough axis, above normal precipitation is favored for the northern and
eastern parts of Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle. Farther to the
west,
near to below normal precipitation is more likely across southwestern Mainland
Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutians.

The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due to
good agreement on a highly amplified summer pattern offset slightly by
uncertainty on the eventual track of Hurricane Elsa.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR JUL 10 - 16 2021

Model solutions depict an expansive and strong 500-hPa ridge for July
remaining
anchored over the western CONUS. As represented by the large probabilities,
forecast confidence remains high for above normal temperatures across the West
and Northern Great Plains. Low soil moisture (below the 5th percentile)
throughout much of the western and north-central CONUS is also likely to
contribute to the anomalous warmth. Due to a more amplified trough over the
east-central CONUS through at least the early part of week-2, todays
temperature outlook across the eastern third of the CONUS offers a slightly
cooler forecast compared to earlier this week.

Elevated probabilities of above normal precipitation are forecast from the
Ohio
and Tennessee Valleys east to the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, associated with
a
mid-level trough persisting. Potential effects from Hurricane Elsa along the
East Coast are expected to time off by the beginning of week-2. Ensemble means
are in good agreement that the 500-hPa ridge becomes centered just west of the
Four Corners region during week-2. Although above normal precipitation is
favored for parts of Arizona and New Mexico associated with the Monsoon, it is
more uncertain how far west this enhanced rainfall extends due to the westward
displacement of the 500-hPa ridge and poor agreement between the GEFS and
ECMWF
reforecast tools. The expansive and strong ridge aloft supports increased
probabilities of below normal precipitation throughout the remainder of the
West and north-central CONUS. Anomalous upper-level convergence associated
with
the Madden Julian Oscillation is forecast to shift east to the Gulf of Mexico
and Caribbean Sea. This is expected to suppress seabreeze convection and
slightly elevate probabilities of below normal precipitation across Florida
and
along parts of the Gulf Coast.

Below normal temperatures are favored to persist across much of Mainland
Alaska
due to an amplified trough early in week-2. Temperatures may begin to moderate
by mid-July as this trough shifts northeastward. For the second consecutive
day, model guidance features a drying trend across southern Mainland Alaska
with increased probabilities of above normal precipitation decreasing in
spatial coverage.

The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 40% of Today's 6z GFS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 60% of Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean
centered on Day 11


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to high
forecast confidence in the temperature and precipitation outlooks across the
western CONUS offset by lower confidence for the eastern CONUS and Alaska.

FORECASTER: Brad Pugh

Notes:


Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.


The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below


The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.


In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.


The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

The next set of long-lead monthly and seasonal outlooks will be released on
July 15.

...Elsa may impact Florida and the Southeast Atlantic Coast early
to mid-next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
as low pressure lingers through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. A strengthening upper ridge is forecast over the Desert
Southwest and Four Corners states, while a weak upper trough/low
slowly sinks south in and around Texas, and a fairly low amplitude
trough will be centered around the Great Lakes region.
Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa has the potential
to cross Florida and move up the Southeast Coast early to midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the midlatitude pattern
described above (with the main exception of the
track/timing/strength of Elsa). A mainly deterministic model blend
of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z UKMET and ECMWF sufficed for early in
the period. By the latter part of the week, models generally show
a shortwave moving across southwestern Canada, but with some
differences in the details. The 00Z CMC was the largest outlier of
the deterministic guidance with this feature, so it was not used,
and minor timing and strength differences in the other
deterministic guidance were able to be taken care of by
incorporating some of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

Regarding Elsa, a large amount of model spread remains, though
some guidance may be starting to converge on a track into the
eastern Gulf of Mexico like the current forecast from the National
Hurricane Center shows. The GFS runs for multiple days have been
steady with a track similar to that, though with some timing
differences. And many members of the 00Z EC ensemble now show low
centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.
Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead of a front moving
through the week from the north-central to northeastern CONUS, and
tropical moisture from Elsa may help increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in the latter part of the week
depending on its track.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the
week with cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level
disturbance there.

...Elsa may impact Florida and the Southeast Atlantic Coast early
to mid-next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
as low pressure lingers through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. A strengthening upper ridge is forecast over the Desert
Southwest and Four Corners states, while a weak upper trough/low
slowly sinks south in and around Texas, and a fairly low amplitude
trough will be centered around the Great Lakes region.
Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa has the potential
to cross Florida and move up the Southeast Coast early to midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the midlatitude pattern
described above (with the main exception of the
track/timing/strength of Elsa). A mainly deterministic model blend
of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z UKMET and ECMWF sufficed for early in
the period. By the latter part of the week, models generally show
a shortwave moving across southwestern Canada, but with some
differences in the details. The 00Z CMC was the largest outlier of
the deterministic guidance with this feature, so it was not used,
and minor timing and strength differences in the other
deterministic guidance were able to be taken care of by
incorporating some of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means
later in the period.

Regarding Elsa, a large amount of model spread remains, though
some guidance may be starting to converge on a track into the
eastern Gulf of Mexico like the current forecast from the National
Hurricane Center shows. The GFS runs for multiple days have been
steady with a track similar to that, though with some timing
differences. And many members of the 00Z EC ensemble now show low
centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.
Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead of a front moving
through the week from the north-central to northeastern CONUS, and
tropical moisture from Elsa may help increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in the latter part of the week
depending on its track.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the
week with cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level
disturbance there.

FXUS21 KWNC 021912
PMDTHR
US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT July 02 2021

SYNOPSIS: The 0Z ECMWF and 0Z GEFS ensemble means indicate increasing positive
mid-level height anomalies over the central and western contiguous U.S. by the
beginning of week-2, before weakening again by the middle of the period. This
anomalous mid-level high pressure across the western two-thirds of the lower
48
continues to support increased chances for excessive heat across the region,
with decreasing chances by the end of week-2. Surface low pressure development
and frontal activity increases the potential for heavy precipitation across
parts of the Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and Tennessee Valley early in the
period. Enhanced monsoonal moisture and precipitation may result in localized
flooding over parts of Arizona and New Mexico. Over Alaska, the mid-level
pattern is not anticipated to be amplified, resulting in no hazards being
anticipated.

HAZARDS

High risk of excessive heat for parts of the Great Basin, Northern Rockies,
and
Southwest, Sat-Sun, Jul 10-11.

Moderate risk of excessive heat for parts of the Rockies, Great Basin,
interior
California, and Southwest, Sat-Mon, Jul 10-12.

Slight risk of excessive heat for much of the western CONUS, and the
north-central CONUS, Sat-Thu, Jul 10-15.

Slight risk of heavy precipitation for parts of the Ohio Valley, Appalachians,
and Tennessee Valley, Sat-Mon, Jul 10-12.

Slight risk of high winds for coastal parts of Northern California, Sat-Mon,
Jul 10-12.

Flooding possible for parts of eastern Arizona and western New Mexico.

DETAILED SUMMARY

FOR MONDAY JULY 05 - FRIDAY JULY 09:
https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/threats/threats.php__;!!DZ3fjg!pTkKCvlt9IRNLPbhwvb-LuQAz8KQa2yL_D0bOqI3U93AYMl6GzjopNlz36sYaGdVtL-wo7Fi$

FOR SATURDAY JULY 10 - FRIDAY JULY 16: The 0Z ECMWF and GEFS ensemble means
are
in good agreement today regarding amplified mid-level ridging across the
western two-thirds of the CONUS, building from day 7 (July 9) into week-2,
continuing the increased risk of excessive heat across the region. Positive
mid-level height anomalies are more widespread for the beginning of week-2,
compared to the last few days, resulting in increased chances for excessive
heat. Both the GEFS and ECMWF reforecast tools now indicate probabilities
exceeding 60% across parts of the southwestern CONUS at the beginning of the
period for maximum temperatures exceeding the 85th percentile and 95 Deg F
(105
Deg F across the central valley of California and the Desert Southwest).
Therefore, a high risk of excessive heat is introduced in today's outlook for
parts of the Great Basin, Northern Rockies, and Southwest, Jul 10 to 11. A
moderate risk of excessive heat (>40%) is posted for parts of the Rockies,
Great Basin, interior California, and Southwest, July 10 to 12, and is
extended
slightly further south, but no longer extends eastward to the Dakotas compared
to yesterdays outlook. A slight risk of excessive heat is maintained for parts
of the western CONUS, and the north-central CONUS, July 10 to 15. Day 14 (July
16) is not included in the slight risk due to the signal for widespread
excessive heat in both reforecast tools decreasing significantly by the end of
week-2. Mid-level ridging, however, may still continue across parts of the
northern tier of the CONUS from the end of week-2 into week-3, which could
support above normal temperatures across the western CONUS, but not
necessarily
reaching excessive heat thresholds over as widespread a region. Triple digit
temperatures are possible across some parts of the higher elevations across
the
West, where combined with below normal precipitation predominately favored
during week-2, is likely to exacerbate ongoing moderate (D1) to extreme
drought
(D4) conditions being felt throughout this part of the country. Heat-driven
impacts expected also include locally elevated fire weather conditions as well
as direct health risks for human and animal populations across the highlighted
regions.



Across the tropics, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) continues to monitor
Hurricane Elsa, located at approximately 62W over the tropical Atlantic, as of
2pm EDT. The NHC 5 day outlook favors Elsa to weaken to a Tropical Storm as it
reaches Cuba and approaches Florida by next Tuesday. The last several runs of
the deterministic GFS as well as the ECMWF probabilistic tropical cyclone
activity guidance generally favors this storm tracking near the East Coast
during week-1 and moving off the Northeast by the beginning of week-2.



Mid-level troughing across the eastern third of the CONUS is anticipated to
support surface low formation and frontal activity, at least at the beginning
of the period. A slight risk of heavy precipitation is posted for parts of the
Ohio Valley, Appalachians, and Tennessee Valley, July 10 to 12, based on where
the ECMWF reforecast tool indicates 3-day totals exceeding the 85th percentile
and one inch and the uncalibrated ECMWF ensemble probabilities favor 3-day
totals exceeding one inch. The GEFS reforecast tool continues to indicate
lower
totals than the ECMWF reforecast tool, but does show probabilities of at least
30% of 3-day totals exceeding 0.75 inches in the highlighted heavy
precipitation risk area.



Over the southwestern CONUS, model guidance continues to support increased
moisture to parts of the Southwest associated with the North American Monsoon.
Both the GEFS and ECMWF ensembles favor mid-level ridging (594 dm) centered
over the western portion of the Four Corners region which supports above
normal
precipitation in parts of Arizona and New Mexico. A possible flood risk area
is
designated for eastern Arizona and western New Mexico where the reforecast
tools indicate at least a 20% chance for 3-day rainfall accumulations
exceeding
the 85th percentile and 0.5 inches. Although totals are not expected to exceed
pre-defined heavy precipitation hazard thresholds, there is a continued risk
of
locally heavy, convective rainfall over very dry soils to elevate the
potential
for enhanced runoff across the higher elevations into the valleys, and a
possible flooding hazard is issued across parts of Arizona and New Mexico.

Surface high pressure is anticipated to build across the Northeastern Pacific
into the Pacific Northwest at the beginning of week-2, while thermal low
pressure forms over California. This pattern supports a slight risk of high
winds across coastal parts of northern California July 10 to 12, where both
reforecast tools indicate at least a 20% chance of sustained wind speeds
exceeding the 85th percentile and  25 mph.



Over Alaska, weak mid-level troughing is predicted across much of the state,
decreasing chances for widespread hazards based on predefined hazards
criteria.
Near to below normal temperatures are forecast for Alaska, with below normal
precipitation expected across southwestern Alaska including the Aleutians, and
near to above normal precipitation elsewhere during the period.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0228 PM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

Added an elevated area for eastern Montana into western North
Dakota. West/northwesterly winds are expected to increase to 15 to
20 mph while afternoon minimum relative humidity falls to around 12
to 17 percent in this region.

..Bentley.. 07/02/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0140 AM CDT Fri Jul 02 2021/

...Synopsis...
Broad, weak anticyclonic mid-level flow will persist across the West
on Saturday, as mid-level high attempts to develop across the Four
Corners area. A belt of stronger westerly flow will develop across
the US-Canada border of the Pacific Northwest in response to an
increasing height gradient between the ridge across the West and a
series of small short-wave troughs moving across southwest Canada.

... Interior Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will once again be possible
across much of the interior portions of the western United States on
Saturday as strong diurnal heating continues to combine with a
relatively moist airmass. Given the relatively moist airmass,
thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than dry, with the most likely
area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be across portions of Oregon
east into western Montana. Despite several days of isolated
thunderstorms, here the combination of slightly lower precipitable
water values, warmer/drier afternoon conditions, and faster
mid-level flow than on Friday will yield another day of at least
isolated dry thunderstorm potential. Elsewhere, dry, receptive fuels
will pose at least some risk for lightning-induced fire starts,
especially with lightning strikes occurring outside precipitation
cores.

...Excessive heat continues across sections of the Northwest,
extending into the Northern Rockies, the Northern Plains and the
Upper Midwest...

...Isolated heavy rainfall likely along a cold front from the
Mid-Atlantic through the Deep South and into the Southern High
Plains...

...Monsoonal moisture will bring daytime showers and thunderstorms
with locally heavy rainfall to the Southwest through the weekend...


Anomalous ridging continues to dominate the upper-level pattern
over the western United States, prolonging the excessive heat
exposure for residents of the interior Northwest to the Northern
Plains throughout the holiday weekend. Daily high temperatures in
these regions will remain 15 to 20 degrees above normal, with some
places consistently reaching the upper 90s or low 100s. A handful
of daily records could potentially be broken from the Northern
Great Basin to the Upper Midwest on Saturday. Due to the ongoing
exposure to oppressively high daytime temperatures in parts of the
Columbia Basin and the dangerous heat forecast to affect parts of
Montana on Saturday and the Dakotas on Sunday, residents of these
areas are urged to take proper precautions to safeguard their
health and prevent the onset of heat-related illness. These
precautions include: avoiding long periods of time outdoors in the
sun, staying hydrated, remaining in a cool or air conditioned
location, and canceling outdoor activities during the heat of the
day. Excessive Heat Watches and Warnings as well as Heat
Advisories are currently in effect for portions of Washington,
Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.

Showers and thunderstorms are likely along a long, southward
moving frontal boundary extending from the Mid-Atlantic through
the Deep South and into the Southern High Plains. Due to the slow
progression of and the potential for heavy convective
precipitation with the passage of the front, localized flash
flooding will be a concern along the length of the boundary. One
of the areas at greatest risk for flash flooding through Saturday
morning is the Mid-Atlantic. The Weather Prediction Center has
highlighted a Slight Risk for Excessive Rainfall along the
southern Virginia and Carolina coastlines, where antecedent
conditions could support high rainfall rates on the order of 1 to
2 inches per hour. Heavy rainfall and flash flooding threats are
expected to continue throughout the South this weekend as the
front stalls along the Gulf Coast. With the passage of the front,
daily high temperatures from the Northeast to the the Central High
Plains are forecast to drop 10 to 20 degrees below normal on
Friday and Saturday.

Upper-level high pressure settling over the Four Corners region
will assist in pulling monsoonal moisture into the Southwest,
bringing diurnally driven showers and thunderstorms from Arizona
into the southern Rockies/High Plains throughout the period.
Moderate to isolated heavy rainfall is possible, with concerns for
flash flooding expected to persist through much the weekend across
portions of southern Arizona, New Mexico, and western Texas. The
Weather Prediction Center has highlighted Marginal to Slight Risks
for Excessive Rainfall in these regions. To the north, daytime
showers and thunderstorms will be likely across parts of the
Central/Northern Plains along a weak stationary/warm frontal
boundary.

...Elsa may impact Florida and the Southeast Atlantic Coast early
to mid-next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
as low pressure lingers through much of next week...


...Overview...

A summer-like pattern sets up for next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. A strengthening upper ridge is forecast over the Desert
Southwest and Four Corners states, while a weak upper trough/low
slowly sinks south in and around Texas, and a fairly low amplitude

Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa has the potential
to cross Florida and move up the Southeast Coast early to midweek.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the midlatitude pattern
described above (with the main exception of the
track/timing/strength of Elsa). A mainly deterministic model blend
of the 00Z/06Z GFS and 00Z UKMET and ECMWF sufficed for early in

a shortwave moving across southwestern Canada, but with some
differences in the details. The 00Z CMC was the largest outlier of

and minor timing and strength differences in the other
deterministic guidance were able to be taken care of by
incorporating some of the agreeable GEFS and EC ensemble means

Regarding Elsa, a large amount of model spread remains, though
some guidance may be starting to converge on a track into the
eastern Gulf of Mexico like the current forecast from the National
Hurricane Center shows. The GFS runs for multiple days have been
steady with a track similar to that, though with some timing
differences. And many members of the 00Z EC ensemble now show low
centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.
Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead of a front moving
through the week from the north-central to northeastern CONUS, and
tropical moisture from Elsa may help increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in the latter part of the week
depending on its track.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the

disturbance there.

centers taking that similar track, after almost all members stayed
east of Florida in the western Atlantic yesterday. However, the
00Z and now the 12Z deterministic ECMWF still have Elsa weakening
before entering the Gulf, as does the UKMET. The 00Z CMC has a
stronger system but fast and east. Thus, plenty of spread remains.
A more westward track is expected with a stronger Elsa (currently
a hurricane), so it worked well to follow NHC's forecasts for
Elsa's track and strength.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough sets up over Texas making for a heavy rain
threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch totals
likely. Farther west, late-day monsoonal type showers and
thunderstorms are likely Monday into Wednesday over the
Central/Southern Rockies. Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds
are potential threats where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of
Elsa have considerable uncertainty, but there is a heavy rain
threat for portions of the Florida Peninsula Monday into Tuesday
and across the Georgia and Carolina coast Wednesday with Elsa.
Periods of rain are forecast along and ahead of a front moving
through the week from the north-central to northeastern CONUS, and
tropical moisture from Elsa may help increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in the latter part of the week
depending on its track.

The heat wave now looks to persist over the western CONUS through
next week as ridging lingers and restrengthens with max
temperature anomalies of 10 to 20 degrees above normal for the
Northwest, with a handful of daily record high temperatures mostly
in the Great Basin. Temperatures will generally be a few degrees
cooler than average in the south-central U.S./Texas through the
week with cloudiness and rain from the persistent upper level
disturbance there.

...Elsa is forecast to impact Florida and the Southeast through
the middle of next week with heavy rainfall and potential for high
winds...

...Repeating heavy rain is likely to persist over southern Texas
through much of next week as low pressure lingers...


...Overview...

A summer pattern persists through next week as the main jet
stream/westerlies meander over the northern U.S. and southern
Canada. An upper ridge over the Desert Southwest is forecast to
strengthen, while a weak upper trough/low merely drifts southwest
over Texas and into northern Mexico, and a fairly low amplitude
trough will be centered around the Great Lakes region.
Additionally, what is currently Hurricane Elsa is forecast to
impact Florida and the Southeast through the middle of next week.

...Guidance/Predictability Evaluation...

Guidance remains reasonably agreeable with the mid-latitude
pressure pattern described above except for continued uncertainty
with the track/timing/strength of Elsa. A deterministic model
blend of the 18Z GFS, and 12Z ECMWF/UKMET sufficed for Days 3-5.
The main differences outside of Elsa are with the timing and
amplitude of shortwave trough ejecting east from the Pacific
Northwest/southwest Canada. The 00Z GFS is now the fastest with
this low ejection, just slightly ahead of the 12Z ECMWF. The 12Z
CMC was the largest outlier of the deterministic guidance with
this feature by re-amplifying it off the Pacific Northwest, making
it the slowest solution by far, so it was limited in the blend.

Regarding Elsa, the deterministic GFS and CMC are the strongest
with the GFS west of the Florida Peninsula and the CMC east (the
CMC has also slowed considerably from being by far the fastest
model). The ECMWF and its ensembles are still weaker with the
system with track generally east of Florida while the GFS/GEFS are
generally west. The UKMET is still similar to GFS, just a bit
weaker, farther east, and slower. The GFS remains steady for
multiple days have been steady with similar track, though it has
shifted farther west into the Gulf. A more westward track is
expected with a stronger Elsa (currently a hurricane), so it
continues to work well to follow NHC's forecasts for Elsa's track
and strength for the QPF.

...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

An upper low/trough drifts southwest over southern Texas into
northern Mexico through next week making for a repeating heavy
rain threat there each day of the next workweek, with multi-inch
totals expected with totals over a foot likely (though the
heaviest looks to be just south of the Rio Grande. Farther west,
late-day monsoonal type showers and thunderstorms are likely to
continue through Wednesday over the Central/Southern Rockies.
Heavy rainfall, flooding, and high winds are potential threats
where Elsa tracks. Timing and strength of Elsa still have
considerable uncertainty, but the heavy rain threat is more for
the western Florida Peninsula Tuesday and across north Florida to
eastern Georgia/South Carolina coast Wednesday. Periods of rain
are forecast along and ahead of a front moving through the week
from the north-central to northeastern CONUS, and tropical
moisture from Elsa may help increase rain totals in the
Mid-Atlantic and Northeast in the latter part of the week
depending on its track.

The heat wave persists over the western CONUS through next week as
ridging restrengthens with max temperature anomalies of generally
10 to 15 degrees above normal for the Northwest/northern Great
Basin, challenging several daily high temperature record, mostly
in the northern Great Basin Tuesday and Wednesday. Temperatures
will generally be a few degrees lower than average in the
south-central U.S./Texas through the week due to cloudiness and
rain from the persistent upper level disturbance there.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021

Valid 031200Z - 041200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level anticyclone across the western half to two-thirds
of the United States will continue to establish itself, despite a
modest short-wave trough across the Northern Plains impinging upon
the mid-level anticyclone. Here the ridge is expected to amplify
somewhat across the Northern Rockies as mid-level flow across
coastal areas of the Pacific Northwest becomes slightly cyclonic.
This is in response to a series of mid-level short-wave troughs
moving through southwest Canada.

At the surface, a weak cold front will move into the northern High
Plains during the afternoon and evening hours as the aforementioned
mid-level trough moves through the region.

... Northern California and Oregon east to southwest Montana ...

Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will once again be possible
across much of the interior portions of the western United States on
Saturday, as strong diurnal heating combines with a relatively moist
airmass. Given the relatively moist airmass across the West,
thunderstorms may tend to be more wet than dry, especially farther
south. The most likely area for dry thunderstorms appearing to be
across portions of northern California into southwestern Montana,
with lesser thunderstorm potential across Oregon. Despite several
days of isolated thunderstorms, the combination of slightly lower
precipitable water values and warmer/drier afternoon conditions
should limit the ability of some thunderstorms to produce wetting
rains. Elsewhere, dry, receptive fuels will pose at least some risk
for lightning-induced fire starts, especially with lightning strikes
occurring outside precipitation cores.

... Eastern Montana into western North Dakota ...

Dry, northwest low-level flow is anticipated this afternoon in the
wake of a weak short-wave trough. Winds my approach 20 mph by
afternoon, with minimum relative humidity falling into the low
teens. The result will be elevated to locally critical fire weather
conditions.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0159 AM CDT Sat Jul 03 2021

Valid 041200Z - 051200Z

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level anticyclone across will remain the primary weather
feature across the western half to two-thirds of the United States
on Sunday. Along the western periphery of this ridge, a series of
small short-wave troughs will lift north through the Western Great
Basin, bringing with them an increase in thunderstorm potential.

... Western Great Basin ...

Thunderstorms are expected across the Great Basin on Thursday as
another northward moisture surge coupled with strong diurnal heating
results in mid-level instability atop a very dry sub-cloud layer.
Several small mid-level short-wave troughs, potentially convectively
induced by Saturday's convection, will move northward across the
region. These perturbations will increase the likelihood of
thunderstorm initiation, leading to more storms than in previous
days, but also bring increased mid-level flow and a propensity for
faster storm motion. The net result of the increased number of
storms and faster storm motion than previous days will be a
combination of wet and dry thunderstorms, with lightning-induced
fire starts possible.

...Excessive heat to continue across the Northwest and Northern
Plains...

...Showers and thunderstorms likely along a frontal boundary
draped across the Gulf Coast with monsoonal moisture likely across
the Southwest and southern High Plains...

...Slight risk for severe thunderstorms from northeast Colorado
into western Nebraska...

Excessive heat is expected to continue through the Holiday weekend
across the Northwest and Northern parts of the country. Saturday
should be the hottest, with daytime highs well into the 90s or low
100s for many from the northern Great Basin into the Northern
Plains and Upper Midwest. A handful of daily record highs are
possible across these regions as well on Saturday. By Sunday and
Monday, the heat should subside somewhat, however temperatures are
still expected to be well above normal for some locations which
would only prolong the heat stress. Excessive heat warnings and
heat advisories remain in effect for parts of the Northwest and
eastern Montana.

Showers and thunderstorms are likely along a nearly stationary
frontal boundary which should settle along the Gulf Coast through
much of the period. Moderate to locally heavy to excessive
rainfall is possible from northern Florida to eastern Texas.
Farther west, monsoonal moisture will bring diurnally driven
showers and storms into parts of the Southwest and southern High
Plains each day. Again, there is a threat for moderate to locally
heavy rainfall and isolated flash flooding. Elsewhere, scattered
showers and storms will extend northward into the central High
Plains and the Dakotas along a slow moving warm front and ahead of
a cold front dropping into the Northern tier states. SPC
highlights a small area from northeast Colorado into Western
Nebraska within a slight risk for severe weather. Across the
Northeast, unsettled weather will continue as a surface low
deepens offshore.

While the Northern and Western parts of the country continue to
bake, the remainder of the U.S. should be more comfortably near or
below normal through the weekend. The greatest below normal
anomalies should center across parts of the southern High Plains,
and especially the Northeast on Saturday where daytime highs 10 to
20 degrees below normal are possible with daily record low max
temps challenged. The southern and eastern states should warm up
by the Fourth of July holiday with much above normal temperatures
seeping into the Midwest/Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic states by
Monday.

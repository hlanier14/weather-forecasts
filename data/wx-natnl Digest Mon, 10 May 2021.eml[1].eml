Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1129 AM CDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 091700Z - 101200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...

Much of the previous forecast remains on track. Visible satellite
depicts clear skies along the West Coast, where continued
boundary-layer heating/mixing will promote RH dropping into the
15-20% range through the afternoon, as also suggested by the latest
guidance. Latest METAR observations also show 15-25 mph sustained
north-northwesterly surface winds ongoing across portions of the
Sacramento Valley. These stronger surface winds are expected to
continue through the period given persistent northwesterly mid-level
flow overspreading northern California, hence the maintenance of the
Elevated/Critical fire weather highlights.

Widespread high-end Elevated conditions are still expected across
portions of the Lower Colorado River Valley this afternoon. Latest
guidance consensus depicts multiple areas that will be susceptible
to at least locally Critical overlapping surface winds/RH by
afternoon peak heating. The relatively patchy nature of Critical
meteorological conditions and overall lack of widespread ERCs
exceeding climatological average preclude Critical highlights.

Southwesterly surface winds and RH are expected to reach Elevated
criteria across portions of the Carolinas later this afternoon. The
primary mitigating factor for introducing Elevated highlights
continues to be the questionable receptiveness of fuels to fire
spread given recent rainfall. Nonetheless, at least localized
wildfire-spread potential will exist wherever fuel beds have
sufficiently dried.

..Squitieri.. 05/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0125 AM CDT Sun May 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
A broad mid-level trough positioned over the Northern Rockies will
elongate and become quasi-stationary, resulting in a zonal flow
pattern over much of the central and eastern CONUS, while parts of
the West Coast remain under northwesterly flow aloft. Mid-level flow
throughout this regime will be somewhat enhanced (40-50 kt), with
some strengthening of the flow expected in the West as a jet streak
enters the region. At the surface, a cold front will surge
southeast, from the Southern Plains into the lower Mississippi
Valley. Farther west, relatively clear/dry conditions are expected
to persist.

...Northern California...
Diurnal heating/mixing processes should result in sustained surface
winds of 20 mph, gusting to 25-30 mph (particularly in
terrain-favored regions). Meanwhile, RH values should fall into the
teens amid dry/receptive fuels, resulting in critical fire-weather
potential during the late morning into the afternoon hours. Elevated
fire-weather conditions can be expected in proximity to the critical
area, delineated by slightly weaker surface winds and higher RH
values.

...Southwest...
A broad region of elevated fire-weather conditions should develop as
the marginally enhanced flow aloft mixes toward the surface during
the afternoon. Widespread sustained winds of 10-20 mph can be
expected, with locally higher gusts. RH value will vary across the
region, with relatively higher RH values found across portions of
central Arizona/New Mexico compared to adjacent areas. Fuels remain
receptive to large-fire spread amid prolonged drought conditions.
Locally critical fire-weather conditions are certainly possible, but
this potential appears too localized to include any additional
highlights at this time.

...Parts of the Southeast into the Carolinas/Virginia...
Breezy southerly winds should develop across the region in advance
of the approaching cold front. Despite southerly low-level flow
trajectories, RH values may approach critical thresholds at least
briefly during the afternoon, but these conditions will likely be
too localized/transient to include an elevated area at this time.

...Overview, Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model guidance continues with the theme of keeping a broad
positively-tilted trough across the northern tier states in
contrast with an anchoring ridge in the West as the next upper
trough reaches the Pacific Northwest next weekend.  The
positively-tilted trough in the East will tend to push the most
active weather near the Gulf Coast and the Southeast midweek
further into the Gulf and into the western Atlantic by the end of
the week.  For the trough arriving across the Pacific Northwest
next weekend, models show some expected uncertainty regarding its
timing and degree of interaction with the cooler airmass over
interior western Canada.  The ensemble means are relatively
agreeable with each other regarding this feature.  The GFS and
GEFS show a typically faster progression relative to the ECMWF and
CMC, as the trough moves into the northern Rockies.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution very close to WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall will likely extend
near/along the Gulf Coast to begin the medium-range period on
Wednesday while lighter rain should continue over parts of the
Southeast into Thursday.  Then a high pressure system will feed
drier air from the north and push the surface front gradually
southward into the Gulf and down the Florida Peninsula.  Florida
may initially see varying intensity of rainfall but a developing
frontal wave east of Florida will tend to guide the most active
weather offshore.  Scattered areas of rainfall may extend from the
northern Rockies through parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley
ahead of a wavy front behind the eastern U.S. upper trough.  Some
of this activity could drop further south into the central Plains
during the weekend before sliding eastward under upper-level
northwesterly flow but low confidence is relatively low at this
time.  Elsewhere, some precipitation should develop across the
northern Rockies on Friday and then expand eastward into the
northern Plains during the weekend.  Some wet snow is possible in
the higher elevation during the night.

Areas from the central/southern Plains through the Southeast will
see unseasonably cool highs on Wednesday with broad coverage of
minus 10-20F anomalies.  A few locations could challenge daily
records for cool highs.  The Southeast and to a lesser extent
farther back into Texas may still see highs at least 10-15F below
normal on Thursday.  Other portions of the East will likely be
below normal as well but with less extreme anomalies.  A
moderating trend over the South and East should yield temperatures
within a few degrees on either side of normal by next Sunday.  The
upper ridge moving into the West and then the Plains will favor an
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California and
Oregon into the Great Basin with plus 5-10F or so anomalies
extending into the central Rockies/Plains.  An approaching upper
trough should gradually erode this area of warmth but recent
slower/weaker trends for the trough in general plus uncertainty
over the character of the trough suggest a slower and less
pronounced cooling trend.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 12Z Wed May 12 2021 - 12Z Sun May 16 2021

...Overview, Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

Latest model guidance continues with the theme of keeping a broad
positively-tilted trough across the northern tier states in
contrast with an anchoring ridge in the West as the next upper
trough reaches the Pacific Northwest next weekend.  The
positively-tilted trough in the East will tend to push the most
active weather near the Gulf Coast and the Southeast midweek
further into the Gulf and into the western Atlantic by the end of
the week.  For the trough arriving across the Pacific Northwest
next weekend, models show some expected uncertainty regarding its
timing and degree of interaction with the cooler airmass over
interior western Canada.  The ensemble means are relatively
agreeable with each other regarding this feature.  The GFS and
GEFS show a typically faster progression relative to the ECMWF and
CMC, as the trough moves into the northern Rockies.

The WPC medium-range forecast package was based on the consensus
of the 00Z ECMWF/00Z EC mean, the 06Z GFS/GEFS mean, as well as
some contribution from the 00Z CMC and CMC mean.  This yielded a
solution very close to WPC continuity.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Some moderate to perhaps locally heavy rainfall will likely extend
near/along the Gulf Coast to begin the medium-range period on
Wednesday while lighter rain should continue over parts of the
Southeast into Thursday.  Then a high pressure system will feed
drier air from the north and push the surface front gradually
southward into the Gulf and down the Florida Peninsula.  Florida
may initially see varying intensity of rainfall but a developing
frontal wave east of Florida will tend to guide the most active
weather offshore.  Scattered areas of rainfall may extend from the
northern Rockies through parts of the Plains/Mississippi Valley
ahead of a wavy front behind the eastern U.S. upper trough.  Some
of this activity could drop further south into the central Plains
during the weekend before sliding eastward under upper-level
northwesterly flow but low confidence is relatively low at this
time.  Elsewhere, some precipitation should develop across the
northern Rockies on Friday and then expand eastward into the
northern Plains during the weekend.  Some wet snow is possible in
the higher elevation during the night.

Areas from the central/southern Plains through the Southeast will
see unseasonably cool highs on Wednesday with broad coverage of
minus 10-20F anomalies.  A few locations could challenge daily
records for cool highs.  The Southeast and to a lesser extent
farther back into Texas may still see highs at least 10-15F below
normal on Thursday.  Other portions of the East will likely be
below normal as well but with less extreme anomalies.  A
moderating trend over the South and East should yield temperatures
within a few degrees on either side of normal by next Sunday.  The
upper ridge moving into the West and then the Plains will favor an
area of temperatures 10-20F above normal from California and
Oregon into the Great Basin with plus 5-10F or so anomalies
extending into the central Rockies/Plains.  An approaching upper

Prognostic Discussions for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks.
NWS Climate Prediction Center, College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Sun May 09 2021

There is no forecaster message written on weekends.

Notes:

Automated forecasts are issued on Saturday and Sunday. Occasionally manual
intervention is necessary to address quality control and consistency issues.
In
these cases, forecasts are manually drawn but a full discussion is not issued.

The notation for the categorical forecast indicated on the maps is the same as
that in the tables: A-above   N-near normal   B-below

The temperature map shows regions with > 33% chance of being warmer (orange,
"A"), colder (blue, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "N"). Historical average
values for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "f").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
 Probability of N is always < 40%.

The precipitation map shows regions with > 33% chance of being wetter (green,
"A"), drier (tan, "B"), or close to (unshaded, "n"). Historical median values
for the calendar period of the forecast (dashes, "inches").  Labels on the
shaded lines give the probability (> 33%) of the more likely category (B or
A).
Probability of N is always < 40%.

In the southwest and other climatologically dry regions - there will be a
greater than 33.3% chance of no precipitation and occasionally even a normal
(i.e. Median) value of zero - especially during the dry seasons.  In such
cases
a forecast of near normal is effectively a forecast of little or no
precipitation.

The climate prediction center uses 1981-2010 base period means for
temperature...precipitation...and 500-hpa heights as reference in the climate
outlooks.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0221 PM CDT Sun May 09 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

The main change made for the 17Z Day 2 update was to expand the
Critical area across central New Mexico into parts of eastern
Arizona and southern New Mexico, where latest guidance consensus has
continued to trend upward in wind speeds. Otherwise, widespread
5-15% RH is still expected during the afternoon across much of the
Colorado River Basin. Across the Sacramento into the San Joaquin
Valleys in northern California, latest guidance continues to show
deep-layer northerly flow supporting 20+ mph sustained northerly
surface winds coinciding with 10-20% RH during the afternoon. Please
see the previous forecast below for additional details.

..Squitieri.. 05/09/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0127 AM CDT Sun May 09 2021/

...Synopsis...
The upper-level trough and zonal flow pattern is expected to remain
anchored over the central/eastern CONUS, along with moderately
enhanced northwesterly flow situated along the West Coast. Despite
the quasi-stationary pattern, flow aloft within this regime appears
to strengthen somewhat throughout the forecast period. This should
result in a slight uptick in surface winds as compared to Day 1, and
thus, critical fire-weather delineations have been added to each
highlighted region, in addition to converting 40% probabilities to
elevated areas.

...California...
A mid-level jet streak should be located over the region at the
start of the period, associated with enhanced 50-60 kt. This feature
will shift southeast through the day, resulting in weakening flow
aloft. However, winds should remain strong enough to result in
sustained winds of 20-30 mph, with locally higher gusts. Surface
flow appears to take on a more northwesterly/offshore trajectory,
which should result in slightly lower RH values, into the teens and
nearing single digits. Given these conditions amid dry/receptive
fuels, critical fire-weather conditions appear likely.

...Southwest...
An embedded mid-level short-wave trough should approach the region,
and bring with it a zone of enhanced mid-level flow. This should
result in widespread elevated fire-weather conditions characterized
by sustained westerly surface winds of 15-20 mph coincident with RH
values falling into the teens. Within this region, critical
fire-weather conditions are likely to develop where sustained
surface winds of 25-30 mph and RH values fall into the single
digits. The critical area has been confined to the most probable
overlap in the wind/RH/fuels combo, and thus may be subject to
further refinements in later outlooks.

...Late-season snowfall is likely across the Northern/Central
Rockies and High Plains with much colder than average
temperatures...

...Warm and dry conditions will cause fire danger in the

A front extending from the Mid-Atlantic westward to the Ohio
Valley, then southwestward to the Southern Plains will move off
the Mid-Atlantic/Northeast Coast by Monday evening.  The remaining
front will linger across the Gulf Coast States and Southeast
through Tuesday evening.  The system will produce severe
thunderstorms and heavy rain over the Tennessee/Lower Mississippi
Valleys and the Southern Plains through Tuesday morning.  The SPC
has issued an Enhanced Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of
the Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys and the Southern Plains
through Monday morning.  The hazards associated with these severe
thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm wind
gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.  Some of the storms will have a
10% or greater probability of producing hail two inches or greater
over parts of Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys and the Southern
Plains through Monday morning.  The thunderstorms will also
produce heavy rain.  The WPC has issued a Slight risk of excessive
rainfall over parts of the Tennessee/Lower Mississippi Valleys and
the Southern Plains through Monday morning.  The hazards
associated with the rain are scattered flash flooding, where urban
areas, roads, and small streams are the most vulnerable.  The
northern part of the system will produce rain over parts of the
Northeast through Monday evening.

However, on Monday, the Showers and thunderstorms will extend from
the southern Mid-Atlantic across the Gulf Coast into the Southern
Plains. The heavy rain threat will be slightly less and confined
to the Lower Mississippi Valley on Monday.  The SPC has issued a
Slight Risk of severe thunderstorms over parts of the Southern
Plains through Tuesday morning.  The hazards associated with these
severe thunderstorms are frequent lightning, severe thunderstorm
wind gust, hail, and a few tornadoes.  On Tuesday, showers and
thunderstorms will continue along and near the front from the
Southeast westward to Texas.  Also, on Monday night into Tuesday
evening, energy from a weakening upper-level low over the Great
Lakes will move over the Northeast.  Rain will develop over parts
of the Upper/Middle Mississippi Valley overnight Monday ending by
Tuesday morning.  On Tuesday, rain will develop over parts of the
Northeast, continuing into Tuesday evening.

The Northern/Central Rockies will be underneath broad upper-level
troughing, with much below-average temperatures.  The cold
temperatures will support snow across the Northern and Central
Rockies. Rain will also develop over lower elevations.
Furthermore, Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are in effect
for portions of the Great Lakes.  Rain will develop over parts of
the Northern/Central High Plains overnight Sunday.  On Monday,
rain will move over parts of the Central Plains through Tuesday
evening, while pockets of higher elevation snow continue over
parts of the Northern/Central Rockies.  Meanwhile, temperatures
will be slightly above average over the Southwest and California
with dry and windy conditions.  An Elevated to Critical Risks of
fire weather for interior portions of California and into the
Southwest, Southern Rockies, due to the dry and windy conditions
through Tuesday.

Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook

1237 AM CDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 101200Z - 111200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PARTS OF EASTERN ARIZONA INTO
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO...

...Synopsis...
A mid-level trough positioned over the Northern Rockies will remain
quasi-stationary throughout the day, resulting in a mostly zonal
flow pattern over much of the central and eastern CONUS. The
exception will be along the West Coast, which will experience more
northerly/northwesterly flow aloft. A mid-level jet streak embedded
in the flow field, featuring 50+ kt winds, will move from parts of
northern California into the Southwest throughout the day. At the
surface, dry/breezy conditions are forecast to prevail over much of
the West.

...Northern California...
With the aforementioned enhanced northerly flow aloft, day time
heating/mixing processes will allow winds aloft to mix toward the
surface. Afternoon sustained northerly surface winds of 20+ mph
(higher gusts in terrain-favored areas) should occur as RH values
fall into the teens amid dry/receptive fuels. Consequently, critical
fire-weather conditions can be expected, from late morning
throughout the afternoon. In proximity to the critical area,
elevated fire-weather conditions are expected where the wind/RH
combo will be slightly weaker.

...Southwest...
Enhanced westerly mid-level flow present over the region, combined
with diurnal heating/mixing, should result in widespread sustained
winds of 20-30 mph over the region. Meanwhile, RH values will fall
into the teens and perhaps single digits (mainly across east-central
Arizona into central New Mexico). Fuels across the region remain
receptive to large-fire spread, and thus, critical fire-weather
conditions can be expected for an expansive portion of the region.
Elevated fire-weather conditions will occur in regions surrounding
the critical delineation, where winds and RH values should generally
not exceed critical thresholds, though localized critical conditions
are certainly possible.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1239 AM CDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 111200Z - 121200Z

...Synopsis...
The predominant zonal flow pattern anchored over the CONUS will
begin to breakdown as the mid-level trough located over the Northern
Rockies shifts eastward. This will result in a more diffuse height
gradient in the West, and thus, a general weakening of the mid-level
flow field. At the surface, high pressure will settle into the Great
Basin region.

...Southwest...
Despite the weakening flow aloft, diurnal heating/mixing should
allow for sustained winds of 10-15 mph to develop in localized
areas. Dry conditions will prevail across the region, with RH values
falling into the teens. For the most part, any fire-weather concerns
will likely be quite localized. However, there exists relative
agreement among mid-range guidance for elevated fire-weather
conditions developing across west-central portions of New Mexico
into far east-central Arizona. Given this relative confidence, an
elevated area has been introduced for this region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
255 AM EDT Mon May 10 2021

Valid 12Z Thu May 13 2021 - 12Z Mon May 17 2021

...Overview...

Latest guidance continues to show moderate progression to flow
aloft across the lower 48 and vicinity.  Aside from fairly minor
details, there is reasonable consensus for a broad mean trough to
cross the eastern U.S. and emerge into the Atlantic while a
trailing ridge over the West as of Thursday should reach into the
Mississippi Valley by next Monday.  There has been more spread and
variability for details of upstream Pacific energy that should
amplify into an upper trough that reaches/crosses the West during
the weekend, as well as for details of flow behind this feature.
Aside from a front dropping through the Gulf and Florida Peninsula
late this week, waves/fronts will primarily affect the
western/central U.S. as high pressure prevails over the East.
Thus the best focus for precipitation during the period will
likely extend from the northern Rockies through a majority of the
Plains and into the Middle/Upper Mississippi Valley.  Contrasting
temperatures on Thursday, with parts of the West quite warm and
the South/East much cooler than normal, should steadily gravitate
toward climatology with time.


...Guidance Evaluation and Preferences...

With current model runs still showing minimal surface response to
the upper trough crossing the East aside from waviness well
offshore, the dominant forecast difficulties involve the shortwave
energy expected to move into the West during the weekend and
upstream flow that will affect the pattern behind this energy.
After a couple days of increased spread for where/when features
could try to separate, 12Z/18Z model/ensemble runs (and followed
up in the new 00Z runs) have returned to some variation of 2-3
days ago when there was better clustering toward the idea that any
separation that occurs would wait until energy reaches near the
West Coast.  There are still significant differences for what
individual pieces of energy will do though, and predictability is
low due to their small scale.  A blended approach (more models
than means into day 5 Saturday followed by a more even mix by day
7 Monday) continues to provide the best way to navigate the spread
and variability that the models/ensembles have exhibited so far.

Farther west, recent GFS runs trend out of phase with North
Pacific flow from the weekend onward--a result of western Pacific
flow separation which other guidance does not depict.  In contrast
to the flat flow to ridging that the GFS shows near the West Coast
by next Monday, ECMWF/CMC runs and their ensemble means have been
fairly consistent so far in bringing another trough toward the
West--albeit with detail and amplitude differences.  Latest GEFS
means fall between these two extremes, with a weaker and delayed
trough approaching the West.  Current preference is to tilt the
forecast somewhat more in the direction of the ECMWF cluster
relative to the GFS/GEFS.


...Weather Highlights/Hazards...

Expect a gradual increase in coverage and amounts for rain and
thunderstorms over the central U.S. and northern Rockies from late
this week into early next week.  Initial activity will be focused
mostly by weak northern stream shortwave impulses and there should
be a relative lack of deep moisture.  Then Gulf moisture should
begin to contribute more and interact with one or more
waves/fronts as eastern U.S. high pressure nears the East Coast.
With uncertainty in the specifics, shortwave energy emerging from
the West late in the period may provide another ingredient in the
rainfall recipe.  Currently expect the highest five-day totals
over portions of the Central/Southern Plains and Middle/Upper
Mississippi Valley.  Some precipitation could be in the form of
snow over highest elevations of the northern Rockies.  Any
precipitation farther west should be fairly light and scattered.
The upper trough crossing the East late this week may produce some
areas of mostly light rainfall over central/northern latitudes,
with greater coverage during the latter half of each day.
Locations near the Southeast coast and over the Florida Peninsula
could see somewhat more organized rainfall for a time before a
drier trend, as a wavy front initially over the Gulf and Florida
Peninsula pushes southward.

On Thursday the southern tier will see well below normal highs
with minus 10-20F anomalies over parts of the Southeast and minus
10-15F anomalies over parts of Texas.  Some locations in the
Southeast could challenge daily records for cool highs.  Less
extreme below normal readings should prevail late this week over
the remaining majority of the central/eastern U.S.  Meanwhile
temperatures are likely to be up to 10-20F above normal over areas
from Oregon/California into the Great Basin late this week with
more moderate anomalies stretching into the central Rockies/High
Plains late this week into the weekend.  During the weekend upper
troughing that moves into the West should bring temperatures back
down toward normal across the region from west to east.  The
moderating trends for both cool and warm areas from late this week
may yield highs within a few degrees on either side of normal over
much of the lower 48 by next Monday.

...Widespread rain and thunderstorms are expected across the
south-central to southeastern U.S., with some severe weather and
flash flooding possible...

...Late-season snowfall is likely across the Northern/Central
Rockies and High Plains with much colder than average
temperatures...

...Warm and dry conditions will cause fire danger in the
southwestern U.S. and California...

A slow-moving front is forecast to meander over the south-central
and southeastern U.S. over the next few days, and the front will
help to focus abundant moisture to cause widespread showers and
thunderstorms across the region. Today into tonight, severe
thunderstorms is most likely for portions of southern Texas as
well as eastern North Carolina, where Slight Risks of severe
weather are in place from the Storm Prediction Center for tornado,
wind, and hail threats (southern Texas could see very large hail).
Some strong to severe thunderstorms cannot be ruled out along all
the Gulf Coast states as well. Additionally, heavy rain is
possible and is currently forecast to focus near the central Gulf
Coast, and isolated to scattered flash floods are possible there
with a Slight Risk of excessive rainfall and a Flash Flood Watch.
Then on Tuesday, moderate to locally heavy rainfall with
thunderstorms can be expected for parts of Texas into the Lower
Mississippi Valley, and another Slight Risk of excessive rainfall
is in place for those areas. Meanwhile, farther north, surface
lows in the vicinity of the Northeast will help cause persistent
showers there, with light to moderate rainfall expected.

Upper-level energy and cold temperatures will lead to snow across
the Northern and Central Rockies. The highest elevations of
Colorado and Wyoming can expect well over a foot of snow. Even in
lower elevations of the Central High Plains, precipitation type
could fluctuate and some may fall in the form of snow. Cities like
Cheyenne, Wyoming could see around 6 inches of snow, and Colorado
Springs could see some accumulating late-season snow too.

Temperatures are expected to be below average for much of the
country behind the potent cold front, especially by Tuesday. High
temperatures in central parts of the High Plains are forecast to
be the most anomalous, with temperatures around 30 degrees below
average for this time of year. In terms of cold low temperatures,
Freeze Warnings and Frost Advisories are once again in effect for
portions of the Great Lakes region and Ohio Valley this morning.
Exceptions that will be warmer than normal are the West Coast,
especially California, as well as southern Texas and Florida, with
temperatures right around normal in the Southwest. Warm
temperatures and as dry and windy conditions should unfortunately
once again cause Elevated to Critical Risks of fire weather and
Red Flag Warnings in interior northern California and the
Southwest/Southern Rockies/Southern High Plains today. Conditions
should improve somewhat by Tuesday.

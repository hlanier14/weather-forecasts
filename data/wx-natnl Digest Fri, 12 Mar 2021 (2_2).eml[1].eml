...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible over parts of
the Central/Southern Plains and Middle Mississippi Valley through
Saturday...

...Warm temperatures 10 to 20 degrees above average found from the
Southeast to the Northeast Friday...

...Critical risk of fire weather for central and southern New
Mexico...

...Significant winter storm to begin Friday evening into Saturday
morning across the Central Rockies and central High Plains...

The stage is set for a significant winter storm to impact the
central Rockies and the central High Plains as a cold upper-level
low moving across the Southwest interacts with a stationary front
across the central Plains during the next couple of days.  The
stationary front has lately become the focus for severe
thunderstorms and locally heavy rain across the central Plains to
the mid-Mississippi Valley as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is
lifted along the boundary.  Meanwhile, the cold upper low moving
into the Southwest will bring higher elevation snows from the
Sierra Nevada to the Four-Corners region today, before ingesting
additional Gulf moisture and then dumping more heavy rain again
from the central Plains to the mid-Mississippi Valley today into
early Saturday.  As the weekend progresses, increasing interaction
of the upper low with the stationary front is forecast to bring a
significant winter storm across the central Rockies and nearby
High Plains.  Snowfall amounts of a couple of feet is quite
possible along the Front Range of Colorado and Wyoming, and more
than foot possible over the central High Plains.  In addition,
increasingly strong and gusty winds are expected to accompany the
heavy snow by Sunday as the storm system is forecast to intensify
more rapidly.  Widespread travel impacts are likely as strong
winds combined with snowfall rates of one to two inches per hour
could produce near blizzard conditions. Winter Storm Watches and
Warnings have been issued and include southeast Wyoming, northeast
and central Colorado, as well as western Nebraska.

Ahead of the cold front, temperatures will rise into the 60s and
70s across the East Coast. As the system propagates quickly
northeast the northern half of the frontal boundary is expected to
keep pace, dousing the Northeast in light to moderate rain into
the early morning Saturday. Conversely, the southern half of the
frontal boundary will more or less stall over an area extending
from the Central/Southern Plains to the Ohio and Tennessee
Valleys. Showers and thunderstorms will persist along the leading
edge of the frontal boundary, some of which could become severe.
The Storm Prediction Center has issued a Slight Risk for severe
thunderstorms for portions of the Central Plains and Mississippi
Valley through tomorrow morning. Damaging wind gusts and large
hail are expected to be the main threats with these storms. The
threat for severe weather will continue throughout the period,
with the primary region of concern tomorrow being a Slight Risk
area extending from the Texas Panhandle to southwestern Oklahoma,
while central Texas, central Oklahoma and a portion of southern
Kansas will be at greatest risk on Saturday.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR EASTERN NEW MEXICO AND WEST
TEXAS...

...Synopsis...
A negatively tilted mid-level trough across the Four Corners will
continue to deepen/mature through the day as a 90-100 kt mid-level
jet streak wraps around the eastern side of the trough. A surface
low will rapidly develop across eastern Colorado as northwesterly
flow aloft will dominate the eastern US. Critical fire weather
conditions are expected across the southern High Plains.

...Southern High Plains...
Widespread elevated and critical fire weather conditions are likely
behind a well developed dryline/lee trough across eastern New Mexico
and west Texas through tomorrow evening. Surface pressure gradients
and the strong mid-level jet will bolster southwesterly
boundary-layer flow to 25-40 mph through the afternoon hours. The
dry nature of the downslope airmass and deep diurnal mixing will
contribute to surface RH as low as 10% through peak heating. Given
receptive fine fuels across much of the region, critical fire
weather conditions are likely. However, the eastward extent of
elevated/critical conditions remains somewhat uncertain due to model
differences in dryline mixing/placement through the afternoon.

...Mid-Atlantic...
A dry post frontal airmass is likely to develop across portions of
the Mid-Atlantic tomorrow afternoon as high pressure is forecast to
intensify across the central Great Lakes.  Westerly winds of 10 to
15 mph and surface humidity of 25-30% will be possible. Locally
elevated fire weather conditions may develop through the afternoon
hours, but high-cloud cover and marginal fuels may keep potential
limited to locally elevated.

to the southern High Plains...

Watches and Warnings have been issued for the central Rockies to
the central High Plains.

Ahead of the cold front, a taste of spring will continue today for
much of the East Coast as temperatures are forecast to rise into
the 60s and 70s, while low 80s are forecast for the Deep South
into the Southeast.  Colder air will then spread across the Great
Lakes into the Northeast as a reinforcing cold front moves through
the region Friday night into early Saturday.  Some light wintry
precipitation is possible over interior New England early on
Sunday.  In the mean time, precipitation should reach the Pacific
Northwest coast and northern California early on Sunday ahead of
the next Pacific frontal system.  Over the southern Rockies and
down into the southern High Plains, increasingly dry and gusty
downslope winds south of the developing winter storm will promote
elevated to critical fire danger across these areas into the
weekend.

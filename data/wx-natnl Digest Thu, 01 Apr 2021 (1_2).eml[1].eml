Day 1 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
1142 AM CDT Wed Mar 31 2021

Valid 311700Z - 011200Z

Critical to extremely critical meteorological conditions are ongoing
this morning across southern California. However, enough fuel
moisture is present to limit a fire weather threat greater than
elevated. Otherwise only minor modifications were made to the large
elevated area in the central CONUS. Winds are already elevated to
critical across much of this region. Expect drier relative humidity
in the next hour or two as temperatures continue to warm under clear
skies.

..Bentley.. 03/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0114 AM CDT Wed Mar 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor imagery reveals an upper-level longwave
trough in place over the central U.S. as a surface cold front
continues to push south/southeastward into the Southern Plains and
lower MS river valley. This large-scale trough will undergo gradual
amplification as it translates eastward over the next 24 hours amid
mid-level cold advection over the central Plains to the Midwest. The
resulting height rises and northwesterly flow regime over the Plains
will favor breezy conditions and mostly clear skies over a region
with dry fuels and low humidity. To the west, surface high pressure
over the inter-mountain West and an offshore low will foster another
day of dry offshore winds across southern California that will
introduce fire weather concerns.

...Greater Plains region...
A dry air mass is noted across much of the Plains with dewpoints in
the single digits from eastern MT southward into NE (and only
marginal improvements further south into KS). Although temperatures
will be cooler than previous days, mostly clear skies will help
afternoon RH values fall into the 20-30% range for most locations. A
northwesterly flow regime aloft will feature 30-40 mph mid-level
winds that will likely be able to mix down by late afternoon. The
axis of stronger winds should extend from central SD southeastward
into eastern MO. While a variety of RH/wind combinations are
expected within the broader elevated region, the highest potential
for sustained elevated (and perhaps briefly critical) fire weather
conditions will reside within this corridor.

Further south into west TX, 15-25 mph northeasterly winds behind the
cold front are forecast to gradually weaken through the day.
However, dry air advecting into the region from the north combined
with diurnal heating will allow for a few hours of overlapping
15-20% RH and breezy winds. Elevated fire weather conditions are
expected across the broader west TX region, and transient critical
conditions are possible where RH can fall below 15%.

...Southern California...
Although early-morning observations show weak winds, relative
humidity values in the coastal hills and mountains remain in the
5-15% range with little overnight recovery expected through sunrise
for the higher terrain. Winds are expected to increase after sunrise
and into the afternoon hours with peak sustained winds near 25-30
mph (gusting to 45-55 mph). Downslope warming/drying coupled with
antecedent dry conditions should yield RH values in the single
digits for many locations. While critical wind/RH conditions are
possible, fuels remain marginally receptive and precludes the
introduction of a critical risk area.

US Hazards Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT March 31 2021

SYNOPSIS: There is relatively good model agreement regarding mid-level high
pressure forming across the majority of the lower 48 from the beginning to
middle of week-2, with mid-level low pressure developing over the West Coas=
t.
By the end of the period, the GEFS and ECMWF ensemble means favor a transit=
ion
to mid-level low pressure across the western and eastern Contiguous U.S., w=
ith
mid-level high pressure across central U.S. Mid-level low pressure is favor=
ed
to dominate Mainland Alaska throughout the period, bringing anomalously col=
d
temperatures to many parts of the area. A series of surface lows are
anticipated to form over the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska throughout the
outlook period.

HAZARDS

Moderate risk of much below normal temperatures across parts of central
interior Alaska and western Alaska, Thu-Fri, Apr 8-9.

Slight risk of much below normal temperatures across Mainland Alaska, Thu-S=
at,
Apr 8-10.

FOR THURSDAY APRIL 08 - WEDNESDAY APRIL 14: Multiple model (GEFS, ECMWF,
Canadian) ensemble means indicate mid-level ridging building across the low=
er
48, with mid-level troughing across the West Coast at the beginning of the
period. From the middle to end of week-2, mid-level troughing is favored
across
the western and eastern thirds of the CONUS, with ridging over the central
CONUS. Shortwave troughs may traverse the CONUS throughout week-2. Negative
500-hPa height departures continue to be predicted across the western third=
 of
the CONUS during week-2, which could support enhanced likelihood for episod=
es
of much below normal temperatures across the Pacific Northwest and northern
and
east-central California. However, the GEFS reforecast tool limits this risk=
 to
the beginning of week-2, whereas the ECMWF reforecast tool favors the middl=
e
of
the period. Week-2 model guidance tools generally show lower probabilities =
of
below-normal temperatures across this region than yesterday. Given signific=

model differences regarding the timing and spatial coverage of a potential
cold
event, a related hazard risk is not designated at this time.



Potential mid-level short wave troughs throughout week-2 may support format=
ion
of a series of surface lows across the central and western CONUS, with
associated frontal activity possibly moving across the central and eastern
CONUS. The synoptic pattern as indicated by the model ensemble means is les=
s
favorable for high winds compared to the last few days. The GEFS reforecast
tool no longer indicates areas reaching 20% chance of exceeding the 85th
percentile and 25 mph. The 06Z deterministic GFS also does not show sustain=
ed
wind speeds reaching hazards criteria at the beginning and middle of the
period, with some localized potential of enhanced wind speeds toward the en=
d
of
the period. The ECMWF, however, still does maintain the signal for elevated
high wind potential, with probabilities exceeding 30% of exceeding the
aforementioned criteria over Nevada and the Four Corners region. Due to the
significant differences in the reforecast tools, the slight risk for high
winds
is not included in today's outlook.



There is a stronger signal, compared to yesterday, for negative mid-level
500-hPa height departures over Mainland Alaska during week-2, in terms of b=
oth
the amplitude and spatial coverage. Surface high pressure over much of the
Mainland is anticipated to bring anomalous cold into many parts of the stat=
e
throughout week-2. There is relatively good agreement between the GEFS and
ECMWF reforecast tools indicating at least a 20% chance of minimum
temperatures
falling to the lowest 10th percentile at the beginning of the period.
Therefore, the areas highlighted for slight and moderate risks of much belo=
w
normal temperatures have been expanded spatially in today's outlook. All of
the
Mainland is included in the slight risk for much below normal temperatures,
Apr
8 to 10. A moderate risk of much below normal temperatures is posted for pa=
rts
of central interior and western Alaska. Minimum temperatures in the risk ar=
eas
may fall the lowest 5th percentile and -20 Deg F, with localized areas
possibly
approaching or reaching record low temperatures. High pressure across the
Yukon
combined with possible surface low formation over the Gulf of Alaska could
increase chances for localized gap and outflow winds, mainly over the Kenai
Peninsula, at the beginning of week-2.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
250 PM EDT Wed Mar 31 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 03 2021 - 12Z Wed Apr 07 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging over the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific
will favor troughing just off the West Coast, moving inland, and a
closed low off meandering off New England. In between, ridging
will ease out of the Rockies/Southwest into the Plains this
weekend before translating through the Upper Midwest next week
into the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley. Split in the jet will
provide a drier than average period for the lower 48.

...Guidance Preferences and Predictability Assessment...

Model/ensemble guidance suggested that a deterministic blend to
start the forecast was adequate (GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET) with
the developing/deepening systems off both coasts. The UKMET and
then the GFS were withdrawn from the preferred blend (near the
Canadian and ECMWF) after Sunday due to their quicker handling of
the western pattern and perhaps mishandling of the incoming
shortwave out of Alaska (GFS). Off the East Coast, the models were
relatively better-clustered given the blocked pattern. Maintained
a preference for a slower, but not slowest, trough/upper low track
toward California which was most like the 00Z Canadian as the
ECMWF was again on the slowest side, at times, of the ensemble
spread. The 00Z ECMWF ensemble mean was next preferred due to its
handling of the pattern over the eastern Pacific as a whole but
the GEFS mean was only slightly quicker and was reasonable
overall. WPC continuity also provided great input by next
Wednesday with the speed/definition of the upper and sfc features.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Most of the continental U.S. should be relatively quiet in terms
of precipitation through the upcoming weekend, with no episodes of
heavy rain expected since a large surface high will be governing
the overall weather pattern across the central and eastern states.
Precipitation coverage should begin to pick up in coverage and
intensity across portions of California, Washington, and Oregon as
the Pacific storm system slowly approaches that region by Monday
and into Tuesday. This could potentially bring some heavy snow to
the Sierra Nevada early in the week and perhaps reach the northern
Rockies by the middle of next week. Rainfall should be generally
light over some valley locations in northern California and
perhaps more modest near the CA/OR border along the coast. In the
East, a weak system may bring some light rain to the Great Lakes
next week while the Atlantic system stays just offshore with most
of its precipitation.

Temperatures will still be chilly for much of the eastern half of
the nation this weekend, although modifying some compared to
Friday. Widespread sub-freezing low temperatures are likely
Saturday morning from the greater Atlanta metro area through
central South Carolina into North Carolina (and points northward
and northeastward). This will include areas that are already
beyond their normal last freeze date.

Very warm temperatures are forecast for much of the central U.S.
in time for the weekend, as an upper level ridge builds in along
with southerly flow ahead of the next frontal boundary. This will
result in readings 15 to 30 degrees above normal. Highs could
reach near 70 along the Canadian border, low to mid 80s across
portions of Nebraska and South Dakota, and well into the 90s for
the lower elevations of the Desert Southwest. Daily record highs
may be exceeded in some locations. Some 100 degree readings likely
in the hotter desert locations. A slow cooling trend is expected
for the West Coast as the upper trough/low moves through.

Prognostic Discussion for Monthly Outlook
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park MD
300 PM EDT Wed Mar 31 2021


30-DAY OUTLOOK DISCUSSION FOR APRIL 2021

The updated April 2020 outlook is based on the April outlook released in
mid-March adjusted using the current WPC outlooks for week 1 and CPC outloo=
ks
for the extended range and week 3-4, while considering current climate
conditions, including current La Nina conditions, and following the most
recent
subseasonal and monthly integrated dynamical model guidance. Although La Ni=
na
conditions persist over the tropical Pacific, the weekly Nino 3.4 sea surfa=
ce
temperature (SST) anomaly was observed to be about -0.5 degree C, and
conditions are likely to transition to ENSO-neutral during spring. The Madd=
en
Julian Oscillation (MJO) active phase is currently over the Indian Ocean as
determined by the RMM indices, and forecast by dynamical models to progress
into the Western Pacific in the next couple weeks. The impacts of the curre=
nt
MJO and ENSO state and the decadal trends are mostly consistent with curren=
t
dynamical model forecasts for temperature and precipitation for April.



The updated April temperature outlook has only small changes relative to th=
e
prior outlook. Most notably, the area of likely below normal temperatures i=
n
the Pacific Northwest increased,  while the area of probable above normal
temperatures over the West decreased. Probabilities of above normal
temperatures over parts of the Northern Plains, western Great Lakes region,
and
northern New England increased to be over 60 percent. Dynamical models pred=
ict
ridging generally over the CONUS during April, with some eastward progressi=
on
from the western to the eastern CONUS during the month. While above normal
temperatures are expected for most of the West, except for near coastal are=
as,
early in the month  (based on WPC outlooks), near to below normal temperatu=
res
are favored from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains in the recent CPC
6-10 day and week 2 outlooks, leading to an increased probability for below
normal temperatures for much of the Pacific Northwest in the updated April
outlook, and equal chances (EC) of above, near and below normal temperature=
s
for much of the remaining areas west of the Rockies. Enhanced probabilities=
 of
above normal temperatures remain for interior parts of Southern California,
eastern Nevada, the Northern Rockies, and the rest of the CONUS to the east
coast, in the updated April outlook. Confident outlooks for above normal
temperatures for eastern areas of the Northern Plains and western areas of =
the
Great Lakes region, throughout the month of April, and for northern areas i=
n
the Northeast from the 6-10 day to the week 3-4 periods, led to an increase=
 in
the probabilities of above normal temperatures in the updated April outlook=
.
Expected below normal temperatures early in the month of April for much of =
the
Southeast, offset by likely above normal temperatures in the CPC 6-10 day,
week
2, and week 3-4 outlooks, led to a decrease in the probabilities of above
normal temperatures for this region in the monthly update. Below normal
temperatures are favored in both the half-month lead and updated monthly
outlook for southern Mainland Alaska and the Alaska Panhandle, with a
persistent circulation pattern and troughing over the state. Above normal
temperatures continue to be favored for northern areas of the state of Alas=
ka,
supported by decadal temperature trends.



The updated April precipitation outlook indicates some persistence of the
relatively dry pattern forecast over the CONUS at a half-month lead, with s=
ome
notable changes. The WPC forecasts precipitation for Northern California an=
d
western Oregon in the first few days of April, which are near climatologica=
l
normal amounts for these areas. The CPC 6-10 day outlook calls for near nor=
mal
precipitation, and the week 3-4 outlook indicates equal chances of above an=
d
below median precipitation for much of the West. These outlooks are consist=
ent
with recent CFS precipitation forecasts for April that predict near to abov=
e
normal precipitation for much of the West. Therefore, the chances of below
normal precipitation have decreased relative to the half-month lead April
outlook for southern Oregon, western Idaho, Northern California, and wester=
n
Nevada, and equal chances of above, near and below normal precipitation are
indicated in the monthly update. Uncertainty has increased and probabilitie=
s
of
below normal precipitation have decreased for west Texas and parts of the
eastern Southern Plains states, due to weak probabilities for above normal
precipitation in the extended range. Probabilities for above normal
precipitation have increased for parts of the Northern Plains into the far
western Great Lakes region, as outlooks across all lead times during April
predict slightly enhanced probabilities of above normal precipitation. The
area
of likely above normal precipitation for western areas of Mainland Alaska h=
ave
expanded into parts of the Alaska Interior, with persistent enhanced wester=
ly
flow in model forecasts.



***************************************************************************=
***

********** Previous forecast discussion from mid-March is below ***********=
*

***************************************************************************=
***



The April 2021 monthly temperature and precipitation outlooks are based
primarily on dynamical model forecast guidance in the context of persistent=
 La
Nina conditions that are expected to transition to ENSO neutral conditions
later in spring. However, La Nina conditions are expected to persist into
April
and play a role in climate conditions over the forecast domain. In addition=
,
some areas of the forecast domain consider current land surface soil moistu=
re
and nearby ocean surface temperatures.



The MJO was considered but played a lesser role in the outlook, as there is
substantial uncertainty whether the MJO signal currently over Africa will
persist and propagate eastward during April and lead to significant
subtropical
impacts. This uncertainty is due in part to expected interaction of any
eastward propagating MJO convective signal with suppressed convection over =
the
west-central equatorial Pacific, related to La Nina. Also, statistically
significant impacts on higher latitudes from the MJO are smaller in spring,
compared to winter months.



The April 2021 temperature outlook favors above-normal monthly mean
temperatures for nearly all of the CONUS, with the exception of the Pacific
Northwest, eastward into parts of the northern Intermountain West, and
southward along much of the immediate coastline of California. This outlook=
 is
supported largely by dynamical model forecast guidance, from the models of =
the
NMME and IMME, which are in very good agreement over much of the CONUS.
Decadal
temperature trends contribute to higher probabilities for above-normal
temperatures across the southern tier of the CONUS and into the Northeast
region. A soil moisture deficit across much of the western CONUS may
contribute
to increased probabilities of above-normal temperatures in some regions of =
the
West, particularly the Southwest, where model guidance leads to probabiliti=
es
exceeding 60 percent in some areas of southeastern New Mexico and western
Texas. A much larger area of probabilities for above-normal temperatures
exceeding 50 percent over the West is supported by the consensus forecast o=
f
the NMME. Typical temperatures observed during April under La Nina conditio=
ns
were considered, and support increased chances of below-normal temperatures
over parts of the Pacific Northwest. Dynamical model guidance, as well as
persistent impacts of La Nina, favor increased probabilities for below-norm=
al
temperatures across southern Mainland Alaska into the Alaska Panhandle, whi=
le
decadal temperature trends are the primary forcing leading to likely
above-normal temperatures across northwestern coastal areas of Mainland Ala=
ska
and the North Slope.



For precipitation, consistent dynamical model forecast guidance from models=
 of
the NMME and typical La Nina impacts in spring favor below-normal
precipitation
stretching from California and southern Oregon eastward across the Central =
and
Southern Rockies into the Central and Southern Plains, the Lower Mississipp=
i
Valley, and much of the Southeast region. Increased precipitation variabili=
ty
and decreased predictability in dynamical model forecasts leads to a lower
probability for below-normal precipitation for some areas of the Southern
Plains. Equal Chances (EC) of above, near and below-normal precipitation ar=
e
indicated for remaining areas of the CONUS, including drier areas of the
Southwest. Inconsistency between the typical above-normal precipitation sig=
nal
due to La Nina and dynamical model forecasts of below-normal precipitation =
for
parts of the eastern Central Plains leads to a forecast of EC for this area=
 in
the April outlook.



The consensus of dynamical model forecast guidance favors above-normal mont=
hly
total precipitation amounts for parts of the southern Alaska Panhandle,
supported by typical impacts of La Nina conditions. La Nina conditions supp=
ort
above-normal precipitation for western Mainland Alaska, as does the consens=
us
of dynamical model guidance. EC is forecast for remaining areas of Alaska,
where climate signals are weak and dynamical model forecasts are inconsiste=

Prognostic Discussion for 6 to 10 and 8 to 14 day outlooks
NWS Climate Prediction Center College Park, MD
300 PM EDT Wed March 31 2021

6-10 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 06 - 10 2021

Today's model solutions are in good agreement on the predicted 500-hPa patt=
ern
across North America and surrounding regions during the 6-10 day period.
Dynamical models forecast a 500-hPa ridge and associated above normal heigh=
ts
over the Northern Pacific extending across the Aleitians. A trough with bel=
ow
normal heights is forecast from Mainland Alaska down to the western CONUS. =
A
broad ridge is favored over the central and eastern CONUS, resulting in
predicted above normal heights.

Probabilities of below normal temperatures are enhanced across the West Coa=
st
of the CONUS to parts of the Great Basin and the Northern Rockies, associat=
ed
with below normal heights. Broad ridging predicted over the central and
eastern
CONUS favors above normal temperatures for most of the rest of the CONUS.
Forecast troughing and surface low pressure systems over southern Alaska
increase the odds of below normal temperatures across the Mainland and the
Panhandle. Above normal 500-hPa heights increase chances of above normal
temperatures over the western Aleutians.

The troughing continues to favor above normal precipitation for Alaska.
Enhanced troughing over the western CONUS leads to elevated chances of near=
 to
above normal precipitation over the central portions of the West Coast,
extending eastward to much of the Northern Rockies, Northern Great Plains,
Upper and Middle Mississippi Valley, Great Lakes and Ohio Valley. Increased
odds of below normal precipitation are indicated across the Northeast and t=
he
southeastern CONUS, underneath predicted mean ridging. Above normal heights
also favor below normal precipitation over parts of the Central and Souther=
n
Plains and the Southern Rockies, consistent with the forecast from the
consolidation tool.


The official 6-10 day 500-hPa height blend consists of 20% of Today's 0z GF=
S
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean center=
ed

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8, and 20% of Today's 0z
Canadian Ensemble Mean centered on Day 8


FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 6-10 DAY PERIOD: Above average, 4 out of 5, due=
 to
good agreement among the models and tools, offset by increasing uncertainty=
 in
regards to the precipitation forecast over the CONUS.


8-14 DAY OUTLOOK FOR APR 08 - 14 2021

During the week-2 period, the pattern over the CONUS is generally forecast =
to
deamplify compared to the 6-10 day period. A weakening 500-hPa ridge is
forecast across the central and eastern CONUS. Below normal heights are
forecast over the western CONUS due to a persistent through. Troughing is
forecast across Mainland Alaska with the below normal heights, while ridgin=
g
is
forecast across the western Aleutians, with above normal heights likely.

Forecast troughing and surface low pressure lead to increased chances of be=
low
normal temperatures across Alaska. Troughing favors below normal temperatur=
es
across the western CONUS. Elevated chances of near to above normal
temperatures
are forecast across the remainder CONUS associated with mean ridging.

There are elevated chances of above normal precipitation across western
Mainland Alaska due to predicted troughting. Slightly anomalous ridging acr=
oss
the east-central CONUS elevates chances of near to below normal precipitati=
on
over parts of the western and central CONUS, the Great Lakes and the
Northeast,
consistent with the ERF consolidation forecast tool. Above normal
precipitation
is favored for much of the southeastern CONUS, due to the potential for
shortwave trough development during the period.



The official 8-14 day 500-hPa height blend consists of: 20% of Today's 0z G=
FS
Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, 20% of Today's 6z GFS Ensemble Mean cente=

Today's 0z European Ensemble Mean centered on Day 11, and 20% of Today's 0z

FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE 8-14 DAY PERIOD: Average, 3 out of 5, due to go=

agreement among the ensemble means on the longwave pattern, offset by
increasing uncertainty in regards to the temperature and precipitation
forecast
over the CONUS.

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MONTANA AND
NORTH DAKOTA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH
PLAINS...

Connected northern and southern Elevated areas. It appears lee
troughing will be sufficient across a large enough area for gusty
winds to extend along the entire Plains. In addition, added a
critical area for northern Montana/North Dakota and for a small
portion of the southern High Plains. High resolution guidance has
enough 20 to 25 mph winds along the Canadian border from
north-central Montana to northeast North Dakota to warrant a
critical delineation. There was some snow in portions of this region
today, but the liquid water equivalent of this snow was low and the
grasses which are native to much of this area should be sufficiently
dry by tomorrow afternoon.

In the southern High Plains, added a small critical area where the
strongest winds are expected. In this region, the low-level jet is
expected to strengthen through the day to 35 to 40 mph by evening.
Some of this stronger flow aloft will likely mix to the surface with
sustained winds expected to be around 25 mph.

..Bentley.. 03/31/2021

.PREV DISCUSSION... /ISSUED 0208 AM CDT Wed Mar 31 2021/

...Synopsis...
Zonal flow is forecast to increase over the northern and southern
Rockies Thursday as an upper-level ridge translates east towards the
Plains. This will favor lee surface pressure falls as well as
increasing downslope flow. With dry fuels already in place across
the northern Plains and along the southern High Plains, elevated
fire weather conditions appear likely.

...Northern Plains...
Recent ensemble guidance suggests an embedded shortwave impulse may
propagate through the apex of the upper-level ridge over the
northern Rockies and into the Canadian Prairies through the day
Thursday. As a result, a lee low will likely deepen over central
Canada and support strong south to southwesterly winds over the
northern Plains. Winds between 15-20 mph appear likely and may be
sustained near 25 mph for a few locations. Little moisture recovery
expected through Thursday and a slight downslope component to the
winds over eastern MT will support RH reductions between 20-30%.
Curing grasses and other fine fuels will support an elevated fire
weather concern, though brief critical conditions are possible where
stronger winds and lower RH can overlap.

...Southern High Plains...
Modest lee troughing along the High Plains juxtaposed next to a
surface high over the MS river valley will augment the pressure
gradient over the southern High Plains Thursday afternoon. Winds
between 15-20 mph appear likely, and although minimal downslope
warming/drying is expected, little to no moisture return into the
region will help afternoon RH values fall to near 15%. Fine fuels
generally remain receptive over this region after several days of
warm/dry conditions and will support an elevated fire weather
concern.

...Central Arizona...
Elevated fire weather conditions are expected across central AZ
Thursday afternoon as southeasterly winds increase to 15-20 mph and
RH values fall into the low teens. While confidence in these
meteorological conditions appears high, recent fuel analyses show
ERC values are near normal seasonal values for most locations. While
this precludes the introduction of a broader risk area, locations
with receptive fuels should anticipate periods of elevated fire
weather conditions.

...Southeast...
Elevated fire weather conditions are also possible across southern
AL/GA into northern FL as a dry post-frontal air mass becomes
established over the region. Winds up to 15 mph with RH values as
low as 35% are possible, but as with central AZ, fuels across this
region are generally not receptive (10-hour fuel moisture values
above 20% are noted across this region). Additionally, precipitation
chances on Tuesday may further contribute to fuel moisture.

...Severe thunderstorms and flash flooding possible across the
Southeast and Mid-Atlantic into tonight...

...Developing area of low pressure to bring wet snow across
portions of Upstate New York and northern Vermont between tonight
and Thursday...

...Record-breaking cold to engulf areas from the Lower Mississippi
Valley to Northeast by Friday morning...

A sharp cold front pushing into the Deep South and eastern U.S.
will continue to help triggering bands of severe thunderstorms and
heavy rain from the Deep South to the Mid-Atlantic.  The area most
susceptible to severe weather and heavy rain will be across the
Deep South to the Carolinas through this evening.  Meanwhile, a
wave of low pressure developing along the front is expected to
intensify rapidly as it skirts the Mid-Atlantic coast tonight,
reaching the New England coast by Thursday morning.  A cold air
mass will be ushered into the Deep South and the East Coast
tonight ending the threat of severe weather by then.  However,
as the low pressure system gains strength, wet snow is expected to
expand across Upstate New York and northern Vermont later this
evening into Thursday, where a few inches of accumulation is
forecast to fall across many areas of Upstate New York with 8 or
more inches possible over the Adirondacks as well as northern
Vermont. Winter Storm Warnings and Winter Weather Advisories have
been issued for these areas.  On the warm side of the storm
system, light-to-moderate rain will impact the Northeast tonight
and move into northern New England by Thursday morning.  The
combination of warm temperatures, melting snow, and rain could
cause rivers to rise and ice jams to form across northern Maine
where Flash Flood Watches have been issued.

Meanwhile, sharply colder air will surge into the eastern U.S.
behind the low pressure system.  A large area of Freeze Warnings
is in effect across the Middle Mississippi, Tennessee and into the
Ohio Valleys in anticipation of this cold surge. Temperatures 15
to 25 degrees below average and even colder wind chill values will
enter the Southeast, Appalachians, and interior sections of the
Northeast on Thursday.  However, the coldest time period is
expected to be on Friday morning as the center of a strong high
pressure system settles over the Ohio Valley.  This will allow for
temperatures to drop into the 20s as far south as northern
Mississippi and Alabama.  This may lead to damage to early-season
crops and foliage.  Many record low temperatures are forecast to
be tied or broken throughout the Deep South, Southeast,
Mid-Atlantic, Tennessee and Ohio Valleys on Friday morning.

Elsewhere, the western and central U.S. will have a tranquil end
of March and beginning of April with virtually no precipitation in
the forecast.  A general warming trend will bring well above
average temperatures along with dry conditions, leading to an
increasing danger of wildfires across the northern Plains and
central High Plains.  The southern Plains and Pacific Northwest
will be the only exceptions, with temperatures remaining slightly
below average into Friday.  For southern California, Wind
Advisories are in effect today as Santa Ana winds develop behind a
dry cold front.  Wind gusts up to 50 mph could blow around
unsecured objects and raise the fire danger across the region.

Extended Forecast Discussion
NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
429 PM EDT Wed Mar 31 2021

Valid 12Z Sat Apr 03 2021 - 12Z Wed Apr 07 2021

...Overview...

Upper ridging over the northern Atlantic and northeastern Pacific
will favor troughing just off the West Coast, moving inland, and a
closed low off meandering off New England. In between, ridging
will ease out of the Rockies/Southwest into the Plains this
weekend before translating through the Upper Midwest next week
into the Great Lakes and Mississippi Valley. Split in the jet will
provide a drier than average period for the lower 48.

...Guidance Preferences and Predictability Assessment...

Model/ensemble guidance suggested that a deterministic blend to
start the forecast was adequate (GFS/ECMWF/Canadian/UKMET) with
the developing/deepening systems off both coasts. The UKMET and
then the GFS were withdrawn from the preferred blend (near the
Canadian and ECMWF) after Sunday due to their quicker handling of
the western pattern and perhaps mishandling of the incoming
shortwave out of Alaska (GFS). Off the East Coast, the models were
relatively better-clustered given the blocked pattern. Maintained
a preference for a slower, but not slowest, trough/upper low track
toward California which was most like the 00Z Canadian as the
ECMWF was again on the slowest side, at times, of the ensemble
spread. The 00Z ECMWF ensemble mean was next preferred due to its
handling of the pattern over the eastern Pacific as a whole but
the GEFS mean was only slightly quicker and was reasonable
overall. WPC continuity also provided great input by next
Wednesday with the speed/definition of the upper and sfc features.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Most of the continental U.S. should be relatively quiet in terms
of precipitation through the upcoming weekend, with no episodes of
heavy rain expected since a large surface high will be governing
the overall weather pattern across the central and eastern states.
Precipitation coverage should begin to pick up in coverage and
intensity across portions of California, Washington, and Oregon as
the Pacific storm system slowly approaches that region by Monday
and into Tuesday. This could potentially bring some heavy snow to
the Sierra Nevada early in the week and perhaps reach the northern
Rockies by the middle of next week. Rainfall should be generally
light over some valley locations in northern California and
perhaps more modest near the CA/OR border along the coast. In the
East, a weak system may bring some light rain to the Great Lakes
next week while the Atlantic system stays just offshore with most
of its precipitation.

Temperatures will still be chilly for much of the eastern half of
the nation this weekend, although modifying some compared to
Friday. Widespread sub-freezing low temperatures are likely
Saturday morning from the greater Atlanta metro area through
central South Carolina into North Carolina (and points northward
and northeastward). This will include areas that are already
beyond their normal last freeze date.

Very warm temperatures are forecast for much of the central U.S.
in time for the weekend, as an upper level ridge builds in along
with southerly flow ahead of the next frontal boundary. This will
result in readings 15 to 30 degrees above normal. Highs could
reach near 70 along the Canadian border, low to mid 80s across
portions of Nebraska and South Dakota, and well into the 90s for
the lower elevations of the Desert Southwest. Daily record highs
may be exceeded in some locations. Some 100 degree readings likely
in the hotter desert locations. A slow cooling trend is expected
for the West Coast as the upper trough/low moves through.

NWS Weather Prediction Center College Park MD
157 AM EDT Thu Apr 1 2021

Valid 12Z Sun Apr 4 2021 - 12Z Thu Apr 8 2021

...Weather Pattern Overview...

A broad upper level ridge will be governing the overall weather
pattern across much of the nation to begin the forecast period on
Sunday.  An upper level low will be slow moving east of New
England while another trough amplifies along the West Coast and
moves slowly inland.  This pattern will lead to warm and dry
conditions for much of the central and southern U.S., and some
precipitation for the West and the northern tier states.

...Guidance Preferences and Predictability Assessment...

The models and ensembles are in good overall agreement
synoptically across the continental U.S. to begin this forecast
period, with model differences in the 00Z suite first becoming
evident across the eastern Pacific by Sunday night.  The past few
runs of the GFS have been much faster and stronger than the
ECMWF/CMC and the ensemble means with the trough/closed low
crossing the Rockies and then the Plains.  In fact, the GFS is
about 1000 miles ahead of the ECMWF by Day 7 (Thursday morning),
and therefore received much less weighting in the forecast blend
for fronts and pressures for the second half of the forecast
period.  Through Monday, a blend of the UKMET/GFS/ECMWF sufficed
as a starting point.

By the Tuesday to Thursday time period, the past two runs of the
CMC have been severely out of phase with the other guidance across
the northeast Pacific and western Canada, with much less signature
of a second trough emerging from the Gulf of Alaska compared to
the ensemble spaghetti plots.  With the differences in the
guidance noted above, forecast confidence for the middle to end of
next week is below average, with significant revisions possible in
future forecasts.  For the second half of the forecast period,
additional weighting was applied to the ensemble means and also
included some of the 12Z ECMWF along with previous WPC continuity.

...Sensible Weather and Potential Hazards...

Most of the continental U.S. should be relatively uneventful in
terms of precipitation through the upcoming weekend, with no
episodes of heavy rain expected since a large surface high will be
governing the overall weather pattern across the central and
eastern states.  Precipitation coverage should begin to pick up in
coverage and intensity across portions of California, Washington,
and Oregon as the Pacific storm system slowly approaches that
region by Monday and into Tuesday, although the timing of this
remains in question.  This could potentially bring some heavy snow
to the Sierra Nevada early in the week and perhaps reach the
northern Rockies by the middle of next week.  Rainfall should be
generally light for most of the valley locations.  Across the
Eastern U.S., a weak system may bring some light rain to the Great
Lakes next week while the Atlantic system stays just offshore near
the Canadian maritimes, along with most of its precipitation.

Very warm temperatures are forecast for much of the central U.S.
in time for the weekend, making it feel more like late May or even
early June.  This will be the result of an upper level ridge
building in along with southerly flow ahead of the next frontal
boundary.  Afternoon high temperatures will likely be on the order
of 15 to 30 degrees above normal.  Highs could reach near 70
degrees along the Canadian border, low to mid 80s across portions
of Nebraska and South Dakota, and well into the 90s for the lower
elevations of the Desert Southwest with perhaps some daily record
highs.  Some 100 degree readings are becoming more likely for the
hotter desert locations.  A slow cooling trend is expected for the
West Coast as the upper trough/low moves through and cloud cover
increases.

Valid 011200Z - 021200Z

...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR NORTHERN MONTANA...NORTH
DAKOTA...AND FAR NORTHWEST MINNESOTA...
...CRITICAL FIRE WEATHER AREA FOR THE GREATER WESTERN OKLAHOMA
PANHANDLE REGION...

...Synopsis...
Early morning water-vapor reveals an upper-level ridge building over
the western CONUS as a trough and attendant surface cold front begin
to push off the East Coast. The passage of this cold front across
the Plains and into the Southeast over the past 48 hours has yielded
very dry conditions across much of the central U.S., which will help
support another day of fire weather concerns from the southern to
northern U.S. borders.

...Northern Plains...
Dewpoint values in the single digits and teens are noted from
eastern MT into the central Plains, and regional 00 UTC soundings
reveal minimal boundary-layer moisture. Mostly clear to partly
cloudy skies this afternoon will help support another day of
humidity values in the 20-30% range. A weak upper-level shortwave is
noted in water-vapor imagery propagating northeastward towards the
apex of the synoptic ridge. Stronger flow associated with this
feature, along with weak synoptic lift ahead of the wave, will
support the deepening of a lee low over the Canadian Prairies. In
response, south to southwesterly winds are forecast to increase into
the 15-20 mph range from central NE into SD and will likely reach
the 20-25 mph range for ND and northern MT. A broad swath of
elevated conditions are expected, and a few areas of critical
conditions appear likely - particularly across northern MT where
downslope warming/drying will aid in RH reductions and across
central ND, which is immediately downstream from the driest air mass
(per regional soundings). 10-hour fuel moisture in the 5-10% range
across the region will support the fire weather threat given the
expected meteorological conditions.

...Southern High Plains...
Lee troughing along the High Plains juxtaposed next to surface high
over the Midwest/MS Valley region will lead to strengthening
pressure-gradient winds this afternoon for the southern High Plains.
Southerly winds at 15-25 mph will be common, and although downslope
affects will be minimal, a antecedent dry air mass and mostly clear
skies will help RH values fall into the low teens this afternoon.
The most likely location for critical conditions resides across the
greater OK Panhandle region where fuels are receptive and the
potential for sustained critical wind/RH is highest (largely due to
strengthening low to mid-level flow through the day). To the
southeast into the TX Panhandle, elevated to critical fire weather
conditions are possible, but slightly more marginal fuels preclude
an expansion at this time.

...Southern Arizona into Southern New Mexico...
Guidance continues to show reasonably high agreement in the
potential for elevated fire weather conditions this afternoon from
the southern NM/AZ border into west-central AZ. Easterly winds up to
15-20 mph should be common and will likely coincide with RH values
in the teens to perhaps single digits. Fuels across this region
become more marginal with northern extent, but the coverage of cured
fuels should be sufficient to support an elevated fire weather
concern for much of the area.

...Coastal South California...
North to northeasterly winds will likely continue into the early
morning hours over coastal south CA due to residual surface high
pressure to the north and an approaching shortwave trough to the
south. A handful of surface observations from the region show
elevated to critical conditions ongoing, which may persist into the
mid-morning hours before winds diminish as the low moves onshore.
Despite the ongoing wind/RH conditions, fuels remain only modestly
receptive and approaching rain showers and weak thunderstorms may
further limit fuel readiness. Consequently, no highlights are
introduced.

Day 2 Fire Weather Outlook
NWS Storm Prediction Center Norman OK
0201 AM CDT Thu Apr 01 2021

Valid 021200Z - 031200Z

...Synopsis...
Broad low-amplitude upper-level ridging is forecast to become
established over the CONUS through the day Friday. Impulses embedded
within the larger flow regime will introduce areas of gustier winds
that could lead to fire weather concerns for parts of the northern
Plains and southern High Plains. Elsewhere across the U.S., broad
surface high pressure over the mid-South and Ohio River Valley will
yield relatively weak surface winds and reduce the fire weather
potential.

...Northern Plains...
The exit of Thursday's surface low to the east/northeast will reduce
pressure-gradient winds over the region for Friday. However,
continued zonal flow over the northern Rockies will favor persistent
downslope flow across northern MT. Winds between 15-20 mph should
overlap regions of reduced humidity down to 20-30% by Friday
afternoon, and given receptive fine fuels, will introduce the
potential for elevated fire weather conditions. To the southeast,
portions of WY and SD may experience elevated wind/RH conditions
behind a surface trough that will be migrating across the northern
Plains. However, these conditions should remain fairly localized and
transient.

...Southern High Plains...
The upper-level shortwave trough that is currently off the south CA
coast is forecast to move onshore and into northern Mexico over the
next 24-48 hours. Somewhat weak surface pressure falls are expected
across northern NM ahead of this wave. This will augment the
pressure gradient already in place due to the stout surface high to
the east. Southerly sustained winds at 15-25 mph appear likely from
southwest TX into central KS. Modest moisture return into the Trans
Pecos region (where the driest fuels are noted) may mitigate
humidity reductions compared to further north where RH values near
20% should be common. Fuels across the OK/TX Panhandles are somewhat
marginal due to spring green-up, but should remain dry enough to
support an elevated fire weather concern.

...Wet snow to impact portions of the Interior Northeast and far
northern New England today...

...Record-breaking cold to overspread areas from the Lower
Mississippi Valley to Northeast over the next few days...

...Warm temperatures found across the western United States with
critical fire weather located across the Northern Plains and parts
of the southern High Plains...

A strengthening low pressure system currently located near
southern New England is tracking north and will produce
light-to-moderate rain this morning along coastal sections of the
Northeast and New England. As it does so, a trailing cold front
will usher in much colder temperatures and gusty winds across the
eastern United States. Slightly farther west from the low pressure
center, precipitation is expected to fall as snow today across
Upstate New York and Northern New England. Heavy wet snow is
forecast to specifically impact the Adirondack Mountains and far
northern Maine, where upwards of 4 to 8 inches of snow could fall.
Light snow showers will remain possible this evening and into
early Friday across the Northeast and central Appalachians.
Meanwhile, the combination of warm temperatures and rain could
lead to rivers to rise and ice jams to occur across northern and
central Maine. Flood Watches are in effect to highlight the
potential hazard.

The most wide-reaching hazard associated with the current weather
pattern across the eastern half of the country includes bitter
cold temperatures. Many locations from the northern/central Plains
to the Tennessee Valley are waking up and starting the month of
April this morning with subfreezing temperatures (nope, it's not
an April Fools' joke). Highs today will struggle to climb out of
the 30s and 40s from the Midwest to the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys. As a strong high pressure system builds over Illinois by
Friday morning, even colder temperatures are expected. In fact,
several low temperature records could be set on Friday from the
central Gulf Coast to the Northeast. Freeze Warnings and Watches,
as well as Hard Freeze Warnings have been issued across the Middle
Mississippi Valley, Tennessee and Lower Ohio valleys, as well as
parts of the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. Low temperatures are
forecast to dip to near freezing as far south as central Georgia
and southern South Carolina. Temperatures this cold during the
beginning of April can cause damage to early-season crops and
plants. Gusty winds along the East Coast will make it feel even
colder at times.

Across the western U.S., much warmer and tranquil weather is
expected to end the workweek. High temperatures are forecast to
run well above average and virtually no precipitation is expected.
However, the combination of warm weather, low relative humidity,
and gusty winds will create conditions ripe for wildfires to
possibly spread uncontrollably across the northern Plains and
southern High Plains. The Storm Prediction Center has issued a
Critical Risk of fire weather that extends from northern Montana
to far northwest Minnesota, with a small area issued across the
greater western Oklahoma Panhandle region as well. In addition,
Red Flag Warnings have been issued across the Northern Plains, as
well as southeast Arizona.
